<h2>Home Page for the Beneteau <i>Velvet Elvis</i></h2>

The second <i>Velvet Elvis</i> is a 2013 Beneteau Oceanis 41.  She follows <a href="/velvet-elvis/rhodes-22">her namesake</a> as our family's headquarters for over-water adventure.

In the Spring of 2016, we opened a <a href="http://sailvelvetelvis.com">charter operation</a>, where we offer a full-day eco-tour of the wetlands on the Eastern end of Lake Pontchartrain, or a sunset cocktail cruise.  Please let your friends know, espeically if they have a budget for entertaining clients.

This is the index of our personal page, where we chronicle some of our adventures.


<div class="caption">2023 update:  I only ever wrote the one set of posts for this boat's specific page, and that only covered the "getting there" part of the trip to Cuba.  But the story is pretty good.</div>
