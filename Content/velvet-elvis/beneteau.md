<h2>Home Page for the Beneteau <i>Velvet Elvis</i></h2>

The second <i>Velvet Elvis</i> is a 2013 Beneteau Oceanis 41.  She follows <a href="/velvet-elvis/rhodes-22">her namesake</a> as our family's headquarters for over-water adventure.

In the Spring of 2016, we opened a <a href="http://sailvelvetelvis.com">charter operation</a>, where we offer a full-day eco-tour of the wetlands on the Eastern end of Lake Pontchartrain, or a sunset cocktail cruise.  Please let your friends know, espeically if they have a budget for entertaining clients.

This is the index of our personal page, where we chronicle some of our adventures.

2023 update:  I didn't really keep very many stores here, but the ones that were here on the old version of the site will return soon.  Also, there are a lot of stories from our sailing trips chronicled in the main blog and in the photo galleries.  I'll add a little index to those stories also.
