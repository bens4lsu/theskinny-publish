The first _Velvet Elvis_ was a 1998 Rhodes 22 manufactured by <a href="http://www.generalboats.com/http___www.generalboats.com/home.html" target="_blank">General Boats</a>.  She spent her first few years as a demo boat, going to boat shows and being sailed by her loving manufacturers.

<h3>(2023 update:  from here on, I'm keeping the content what it was back in 2005 - 2012.  You'll see some present-tense language that is dated.)</h3>

In 2000, General Boats decided to let her go to the poor youngish sailers in Louisiana who were buying on credit and couldn't afford an entirely new boat.  Within a day, she had damage.  Within a month, she had a name.

We sail _Velvet Elvis_ on Lake Ponchartrain, which has some advantages.  There are a number of good destinations for an overnight trip, but the lake is so big, that each one requires a full weekend commitment.  Most trips (and some daysails) include a minor fiasco or two that might make for a good story now and then.

<div class="list-of-links">Boat Maintenance, Spring 2005:  This is a short tale of chores and a little sailing at the end of March and the beginning of April.  I had quite a stretch, and took some killer photos (most of which aren't posted, but the prints are great).  Sorry to subject you to a bunch of puppy shots, but they're only small and cute for a short little while, and this trip happened to coincide with that stage for Lily.<ul class="compact">
