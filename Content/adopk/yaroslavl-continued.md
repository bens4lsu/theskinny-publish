Not too much to report since my last update.  We're still in Yaroslavl.  

On Saturday, we spent much of the day walking aruond town.  We walked in the ice and the snow along the Volga River for a couple of hours Saturday morning.  The city was beautiful in the snowy dawn, and I think we all had a lot of fun.  We stopped mid-morning for coffee, and did a little shopping in the afternoon, although we didn't buy anything, I don't think.

We went to the zoo on Sunday.  Lena, our translator for anything we do official, brought her three-year-old son and came with us.  He was amazingly cute, with red cheeks and a chirpy little voice babbling in Russian.  Lena introduced Vanya to the concept of a snowball.  I was surprised that he hadn't seen or even heard of such a thing before that.  

(For lack of a better place to post it, here's a clip of me talking to a turkey at the zoo.  <script type="text/javascript" src="http://mediaplayer.yahoo.com/js"></script><a href="/sound/gobblegobble.au">Gobble Gobble</a>.)

Monday was snowy/slushy, and we didn't do much at all.  Mrs. theskinnyonbenny and Vanya walked a mile down to McDonald's for a treat.  (Vanya has been really good.)  The only times I left the hotel were for breakfast and dinner.  I worked in the lobby for quite a long time, which wasn't exciting in the least.

I'm tired of bundling up in more clothes than I usually wear in a month.  Mrs. theskinnyonbenny is tired of getting plates full of food covered with dill weed.  We got sushi last night, and the tempura roll was coated liberally in that ever-present seasoning.  Mrs. theskinnyonbenny had predicted that she would "lose her shit" if our sushi was dill-weed covered, and Vanya thought it was quite funny when I told him that his Mama would proceed to poo poo in her chair.

Now, it's Tuesday.  We're waiting around the hotel, hoping to visit the orphange again.  We've been postponed until 4:00 pm, which makes me think that it isn't going to happen today.  We'll probably catch a museum or two between now and then.

Tomorrow evening, we're on a train to spend several days in St. Petersburg.  Should be a touch warmer, and there should be a lot more to see and do.
