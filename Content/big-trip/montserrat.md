There is one anchorage, and it had only two other boats there when we arrived.  Others came and went, but there were at most seven or so boats floating around out there.

Montserrat started a string of very small, lightly populated islands that I could not have identified before this trip.  There is one anchorage, and it had only two other boats there when we arrived.  Others came and went, but there were at most seven or so boats floating around out there.

I didn't see much of it.  V and H had a driver take them on a tour, which seems to have focused on all of the areas abandoned during the 90s and 00s due to volcanic eruptions.  V took a lot of pictures and made me <a href="/video/v-shows-us-montserrat-vocano-ruins/">a video.</a>

I saw a couple of beach side restaurants that were right next to the official areas where we clear in and out.  One was pretty good, and one was pretty mundane.  I also spent some time on a really nice beach that we had to ourselves when we went.
