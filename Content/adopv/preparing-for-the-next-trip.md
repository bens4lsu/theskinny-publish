Yesterday, I talked to our adoption coordinator back here in the states.  We apparently made a very good impression on the Russian officials.  The next steps are as follows:

<ul><li>Gather a bunch of additional documents to prove that we aren't criminals, deadbeats, or about to drop dead.</li><li>Send it to Russia.</li><li>Wait to hear our court date.</li><li>Scramble to get travel arrangements and documents, because we again got little notice in advance.</li></ul>
