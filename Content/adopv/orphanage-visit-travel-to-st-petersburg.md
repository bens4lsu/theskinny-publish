Monday's orphange visit was much better.  They said that Ivan was still having fever, but he felt a lot better, and his breathing was back to normal.  He had just fallen asleep, so most of the workers were inclined to send us on our way without a visit, but eventually, they decided that he could sleep in a stroller while we pushed him around outside.  The weather was super-nice, so that sounded good to us.

He was too interested in what was going on to go back to sleep, so we moved on to holding him, then to outright play time.  He decided that I was okay, so we played for a long time out in the nice weather.  It was a very nice afternoon.

Monday night, we boarded the train for St. Petersburg.  It was an overnight ride, and I slept really well.  To me, the rocking of a train was a lot like sleeping on a boat.  When I woke up in the morning, we were just an hour out of town.

I'll post more about St. Petersburg later, but after one day, it's clearly a fantastic city.

Pictures from the orphanage visist are added to my collection for week one.
