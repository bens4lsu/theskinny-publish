<h1>Shit John Said</h1>


In the fall of 2014, I had a contract that brought me daily into yet another cube farm.  One voice routinely carried over the room, louder than all of the others combined.  I'm embarassed about how long it took us to start writing down the utterances of this one man quote machine, but at some point, we finally did.  Behold, shit John said:
