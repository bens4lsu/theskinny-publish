I write this web page just over a week after having shaved my head for the first time.  I've been keeping up with the bald characters with whom I'm compared for just this purpose.  Some are lame, and some are pretty good.

Just for the record, I only recorded real comparisons that came to people spontaneously or naturally in conversation.  Anything that was obviously a result of brainstorming had to be excluded.  Thus, there's no picture of me side by side with Charlie Brown.

    td {
        border: 2px solid black;
        padding: 8px;
