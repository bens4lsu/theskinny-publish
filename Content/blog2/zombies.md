"Why on Earth did I want a boy?"

I never thought I would hear that come from Mrs. theskinnyonbenny's mouth, but sure enough, we had the nastiest, dirtiest kid in Baton Rouge last Sunday, and it got to that point.

We were outside working in the yard, and he ran around behind us, stirring up dirt, wrestling the dogs, spilling juice all over himself, etc.  And he had a constant lava-flow of thick, yellow snot between nose and mouth.  When he would try to wipe it away, it would just smear a snot-dirt mud mix across the face.

By the end of the day, he had lost one of his two shoes.  His clothes were amuck and filthy, and dirt was from head to toe.  

He charged up toward his parents laughing, and I thought, "it's a zombie.  He's dug himself up out of his own grave."  I might have already had zombies on the brain, but that is honestly how it looked.

The reason I have zombies on the brain is because I'm about halfway through <a href=""><i>World War Z:  An Oral History of the Zombie War </i> by Max Brooks</a>.  I'm enjoying the hell out of it.  It's written like a researched collection of interviews in the aftermath of an epidemic/war where the zombies damn near wiped out the normal living humans altogether.  Full of realistic military failures, government bumbling, and the panic stricken underinformed masses, it's so well done that it's almost believable.
