For a number of weeks, three-year-old Kolya has insisted that Anna from *Frozen* has a line in a song where she sings, "Pain in the Ass."  I found that to be a highly dubious claim, and when I caught him watching it after work yesterday, I asked him to give me a call when the "Pain in the Ass" part comes on.

Alas, I had missed it.

After the movie, he let me rewind to where he thought it was.  He took me to the Anna and Prince Hans number toward the beginning of the move.

(If you don't know what I'm talking about, then thank your lucky stars, and let me know which grown-up movies from 2008 to now I should really try to catch.)

It turns out that the line was, "Pain of our past," but I give him credit for getting it close.
