They say that Superbowl Sunday is the biggest day of the year for  wife-beatings.  There's simply no reason for that.  It's easy to come to a common agreement if you just try a little bit.  For example,

<i>Me:</i>  "Won't all of this Superbowl hoopla be fun when the Saints finally make it there?"

<i>Mrs. theskinnyonbenny:</i>  "That won't ever happen, and if it does, they will have long before moved somewhere else."

<i>Me:</i>  "Well, it might.  Someday."

<i>Mrs. theskinnyonbenny:</i>  "I have a better chance of getting the Oscar for Best Actress than the Saints have of playing in the Superbowl."

Long pause.

<i>Me:</i>  "Well, there's a little better chance.  The Saints are at least <i>a professional football team</i>.  You, however, are not an actress."

Another pause.

<i>Still me:</i>  "It's more similar to someone from Baker Little Theater winning the Oscar for Best Actress."

Mutual agreement abounds.
