description: There's a chain restaurant -- BJs -- and one time, quite a while back, they got my order wrong.  And somehow, I've turned that very short story into a whole blog post.

Sometimes my sister and her husband do a community theater production in Slidell.  We'll ususally get tickets on a Saturday night, go see the show, and then meet up for drinks afterwards.

By the time the show is over, the only place around that is open is the chain restaurant, BJ's.  

Remember any of these videos from the 00's?  The guy calls up stores and instead of saying initials, he just tries to pronounce the acronym.  The one where he pronounces a JVC DVD a "joovka duvuduh" is classic.

That stuck to my funny bone so long that I still always call BJ's "buhjuhs."  That has nothing to do with this story.  It's just an aside to illustrate how annoying I am and how it's amazing that anyone ever wants to be around me.

It tends to be quite late by the time we're wrapping up at BJ's, and I'm facing a 90 minute drive to get home.  So one night, I asked the server if she had Red Bull.

"Sure.  Do you want soup in it?"

I thought that was a weird thing, but maybe it's something people do late at night in a small town.  The fuck do I know?

"No thanks.  Just the red bull."

A few minutes later, the waitress returned.  She had brought me a *bread bowl*.
