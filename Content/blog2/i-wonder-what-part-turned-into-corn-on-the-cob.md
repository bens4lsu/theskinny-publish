On Sunday morning, I found myself in a half-awake, half-asleep dream.  The premise of the dream was that somehow over the years, the traditions associated with Easter and the ones associated with Thanksgiving had become confused.  And so I could see it clearly, I was there at Christ's crucifixion.

What actually happened wasn't as it's spelled out in the gospels.  Actually, Jesus's dead body was laid on a table, and it began changing into a Thanksgiving feast.  Some attendees started praying, while I and others of my ilk (not sure what my role was, exactly) started to eat.  I might have even wondered who the Lions were playing.

But that's not even the weirdest part.

The weirdest part is that while I was there (in dreamland) and I could see what was happening, I was also either hearing or making up a narration of the events.  And this narration was all in rhyming couplets.

I probably had dozens of rhymes describing the scene, and I was repeating them over and over in my head to try to make myself remember.  This had something to do with the awake side of my head, because I was definitely thinking of theskinnyonbenny.com as a logical place to publish a lengthy poem about dead Jesus turning into Thanksgiving food.

When I did wake up, all of that creative energy got sucked into the ether.  I remember just one couplet:

<blockquote>Some had fallen to their knees, confessing
While his intestines turned into a savory dressing.</blockquote>

I'm certain that you share my disappointment the fact that some sacrilege and humor is lost to the world forever.
