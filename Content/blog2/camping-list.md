Mrs. theskinnyonbenny and I went camping with the Sharples a couple of weekends ago.  We pitched our tents, walked the dogs, built a fire, had some chow, and drank whiskey.

And that's all there is to tell.  Not much of a story.  But here's the packing list that we made the night before.  I added the red text just for this post.

I didn't know until we pitched the tent that my sleeping bag's zipper was torn up.  I froze my ass off out there that night.  The dogs also gave a little attitude about being asked to sleep on the ground.  I'm pretty sure that if I could read dog minds, I would have heard, "Um, excuse me, but it looks like you forgot the 300 thread count sheets.  Oh, and the part where we like to sleep on something soft."
