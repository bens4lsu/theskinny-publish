This office where I'm working (I don't feel like giving the name, for some reason) has some of the funniest emails that are broadcast out to everyone.  I've never been anywhere like this.  Here's a small sampling over the last couple of weeks.

<br>Good Morning!  I found a small amount of cash in the parking lot this morning, if you believe it is your's please e-mail the amount.
<br>
<br>Sincerely,

I responded with an email guessing $20, but that apparently wasn't the correct amount.  Either that, or they're on to the fact that I'm not even in the same building or parking lot.

<br>Subject: Honeybaked Ham will be on site tomorrow...
</BLOCKQUOTE>

There was no body to this message, so I was left to guess what the purpose of the visit might be.  Are they giving away food?  Are they a big client, so we need to look nice?  Are they slaughtering hogs in the parking lot, so we should be aware of where to park?  It's anyone's guess.

This is probably one of my favorite emails that I've ever gotten.  About once a week, I respond "Oh lawdy...Todd, please forgive my response...I'm over medicated. ? " to a random email.  It's a guarantied laugh (for me) every time.

<br>Does anyone know of a good place to get professional pictures taken?

I think that someone's wife gave him to to-do task of finding a reputable photographer.

<br>If anyone is interested, Honey Baked Ham is here also.  They will also be back next Monday for the Yoga Seminar.
<br></BLOCKQUOTE>

Now the ham and the yoga are interconnected.  I don't think I've ever gotten a single email regarding ham or yoga before, and I honestly have a dozen or more about those topics now.  You'll notice that this was sent the exact same minute as the previous message, but by a different person.

<br>Absolute Document Shredding will be here Tuesday afternoon. If you have anything thats need to be shredded please send us an e-mail. Thanks, Copydoc
</BLOCKQUOTE>

This is a message from one contract company -- who runs the copy room -- letting us know that a different contract company will be coming by to shred paper.  Because the contract company who makes the copies definitely couldn't also shred paper.  That would be a conflict of interest.  "anything thats need to be shredded" is copied directly from the email.  That's probably how they really talk.

<br>IT IS A WHITE CAKE WITH WHITE ICING
</BLOCKQUOTE>

This was a follow up from that same sender.  According to the one person I know who went over to get some of the cake, it was actually a white cake with green icing for St. Patrick's day.  But the real question is this:  why the need for a follow up concerning the type of cake in the first place?

<br>Where can I get crawfish around here?

I'm not sure what the definition of "around here" is, but pretty much every seafood market and Asian-run convenience/liquor store has them right now.  In case you're interested, I got some from Tony's Seafood on Saturday for around $1.75/lb, live, which I thought was a really good price.
