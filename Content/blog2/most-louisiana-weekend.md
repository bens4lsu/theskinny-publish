I had the most Louisiana weekend ever.

Lots of LSU baseball watching, a huge crawfish boil, and then a rodeo performed by prisoners.

I had been told that the crawfish boil was at some place to ride horses. I translated it in my mind and communicated to Clay that it was at "some place that teenage girls go to ride horses." The Jefferson Highway address made me think that it was way out in the sticks, but it was at the Witter place -- a big farm right in the middle of Baton Rouge's most prime real estate. Clay's back yard borders it, and it's just a few minutes away for me.

That place has always been mysterious to me, and I was looking forward to going up into the grounds to explore.

We drove up a long windy driveway, through pretty grounds. There are lots of out buildings. We didn't see the main house, but I have a clue about where it is.

The boil was at some sort of "arena" for horses. I'm sure there's a real word for that, but I'm not sure what it is. Next to the arena was a big stable house, with brick flooring and a chandelier. The horses are living large in there.

Crawfish photos now, and then there's some more about Sunday.

On Sunday, we went to the Angola Prison Rodeo. It's a Baton Rouge cultural touchstone that we've never done before.

First, you get a chance to go through a pretty good arts market with prisoner-made items. The leather work and wood work were pretty good. The paitings look like the ones your mother-in-law made in an evening class with her girlfriends while drinking wine.

V bought a new wallet from a prisoner with a tear tattoo on his face.

It's a little gross, putting prisoners in harm's way for the amusement of the paying public. And the whole animal cruelty part of it. But once you callous your brain to that, it's moderately entertaining.

 I didn't get many photos once we were in there.  There were shots to be had -- several bulls threw prisoners up in the air, but the action comes fast, and there's lots of sitting and listening to a hillbilly talk between photo-worthy events.
 
 I definitely enjoyed it, but I don't feel like I need to do the rodeo again.

 I am, however, fascinated to see the Louisiana Prison Museum that's right outside the gate.  I might make the trek back up there to take a look there one day.
 
 On the other side of the street from the museum -- still right outside of the prison gate, you can get "homemade knives."  Or "shivs," I think they're called in those parts.
