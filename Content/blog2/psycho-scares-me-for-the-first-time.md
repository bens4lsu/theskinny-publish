To a sophisticated kid of the 1980's, it turns out to be majorly disappointing when you finally see the move.  It's really not all that gruesome or scary by today's standards, or even not by the standards of movies 20 years ago.

I hadn't really thought about that movie in a number of years prior to last weekend.  I was getting ready to go play cards, shaving my head in the shower.  I was exceptionally filthy that day, so I was using the guest bathroom.

By coincidence, Mrs. theskinnyonbenny had recently put a different shower curtain liner in that bathroom.  It was a little darker than the previous one.  At the same time, I could hear unusual footsteps moving through the house.  Suddenly, it occurred to me that a knife could come crashing down and slice right through my back or neck without my even knowing it was there.  I felt real fear for a few seconds.  Enough fear to call out and make sure that the footsteps could be accounted for.

(For the record, they were just those of Mrs. theskinnyonbenny.  Although it's not out of the question that she could plot my murder, there's no way it would be in a manner that gets blood all over the bathroom.  Not even the guest bathroom.)

I'm sure it was the combination of footsteps, darker than usual shower, and already having a metal blade scraping across my head, but let me reiterate, it was scary.  And I haven't seen <i>Psycho</i> in at least a few years.

I'm sure that any day now, I'll wake in the middle of the night, quivering in horror about <i>The Exorcist</i>.
