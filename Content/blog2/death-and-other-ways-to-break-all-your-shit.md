I watched the first episode of Death and Other Details on Hulu.

It's your basic, closed room murder mystery, with a tie-in plot being revealed by flashback and Mandy Patankin.  I didn't even get all the way through episode 1 yet, but I think it's going to be an entertaining way to pass an hour each night while waiting for something better to come about.

_Except_, I was completely taken out of the show by this screen, as it passed across.

This is taking place on a giant yacht or maybe it's a small cruise ship.  I know the boat would have stabilizers, but there's still no boat in the world where they would store the fancy crystal like that.

Than again, they told me a number of times to be looking at the details because things may not be what you see.  I don't think that's what's going on here, but maybe they aren't on a boat at all.  If that ends up being the case, I'll come back with a hat-tip for the set designers.
