Shelly sent me this one from <a href="http://overheardinnewyork.com" target="_blank">Overheard In New York</a>.

Boy oh boy, was that every mother in the 70s and 80s or just mine?  For some reason, I've told this story a couple of times recently.  Because it's relevant and because it's on my mind, I'll tell it again.

I was probably about 14 and my sister about 10.  There was a Circle K down at the entrance to our subdivision.  I think we were on our way out of the subdivision when my mom rolled down the window to smoke, and realized that she was out of cigarettes.

She pulled into the Circle K parking lot, and for some reason, she didn't feel like she looked good enough to go in the store herself.  She thought it through, and felt like they probably wouldn't sell cigarettes to a 14 year old.  So she stuffed some money into my sister's hand and sent her in to buy them.

"NO MAMA!  I CAN'T DO THAT!  IT'S ILLEGAL FOR ME TO BUY CIGARETTES."

"Now Sarah, anyone would know that you're buying them for a grown up.  Just explain it if they ask."

"BUT I DON'T WANT TO BUY CIGARETTES!"

"Just go do it."

The discussion might have gone on, but by and by, loyal child that she was, my sister marched into the Circle K with tears still coming from her eyes and bought the cigarettes.

They didn't lift an eyebrow behind the counter.
