The other night, I had a dream where we had a new beagle.  His name was Anfernee.

I love a name that sounds almost like a common name, but with a changed sound.  I especially love it if the sound makes it sound like your mouth got lazy.

There’s a scene in Season 1 of _Severance_ where blowhard Ricken asks his assistant, “Balf, will you prepare my neti pot?”

The name Balf made me laugh for five minutes.

What are some more examples of these names?  @ me <a href=“https://bsky.app/profile/ben.theskinnyonbenny.com” target=“_blank”>on Bluesky</a>.
