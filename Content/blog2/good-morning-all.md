I'm out of practice at this.  After a really busy October and November, I have some time to update my site.  (I haven't even looked at our Halloween pictures yet!)  But, alas, my less-than-one-year-old laptop had a hard drive crash last week, and everything I'm comfortable with is gone gone.

I'm typing this on a borrowed Macbook, fantasizing about biting the bullet on that Windows laptop and making the jump myself.  I have some ideas for iPhone apps I've been wanting to try to develop anyway.
<!--more-->
Do they have batch files for these things?  If not, how would I resize a zillion images for a photo gallery?  Am I the only one who still uses batch files on PCs?

And -- what the hell -- I made a mistake typing that last sentence, and I don't have Home or End buttons on here!  Maybe I'm not quite ready to take the plunge.

Speaking of inconveniences, on Monday morning, I was lying on my back, looking through the morning's headlines.  I had just a few minutes left before I had to get up, kick start my family, and get all of the feeding, lunch making, dressing, medicating, tooth brushing, and Christmas tree watering done.  All of a sudden, I didn't have internet.  I checked the connection, and looked around the room.  

It wasn't just internet that was missing.  It was the power.  And this time of the year, it's still dark while we eat and dress.

I decided we could dress in the dark and then go to McD's for breakfast, but the rain was coming down so hard that the air looked white.  And there was a bit more thunder than I'm used to hearing in the winter.  (Do you all remember when we used to have winter?) 

Today was better until we got ready to leave, and V's lunchbox was nowhere to be found.  I had packed a lunch in it minutes before.  I still don't know where it turned up.

Without fail, if we're running late, and we have to find one missing item before leaving the house, both boys will walk right in front of me, then stop, not knowing that I want to zip from room to room quickly.  I finally get past them and dart into a room.  I fail to find the missing item.  I turn to leave the room, and both boys who were up my ass for the second I was looking are in front of me again.  Stopped.

Uurgh.  It's maddening.  I'm going to bed before I burst a blood vessel.  (Also the Delete key acts like backspace on this contraption.)
