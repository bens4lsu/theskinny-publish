On Sunday afternoon, I found myself with a nosebleed.  That's actually not unusual when it first turns to spring, so I stuffed a wadded strip of toilet paper up my nostril and went on about my way.

Then on Sunday night and all of Monday, I had an absolutely crippling headache.

Those of you who have been watching Lost have already diagnosed me with time travel sickness.  Fortunately for me, <a href="http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,1550612_20245769_20258405,00.html" target="_blank">this article</a> was posted today, so there may be hope that I don't turn into a quivvering, jabbering, useless mess.

The funny thing is, I don't remember when it was that I time traveled.  But memory loss is another symptom.  If I had gone to the future, I wish I had thought to buy a racing form.
