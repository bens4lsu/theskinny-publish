I suppose that some of you know that my employer was recently acquired by Equifax.  This is my first experience working for a big giant company, and I eagerly await the day that this site gets me fired.<br />
<br />
Anyway, the new CEO, Tom Chapman came by the office this week to give us the Equifax song and dance and to welcome us into the fraternity.  
<!--more--><br /><br />I use the word fraternity, because we were all issued pledge pins, and a creed that you can memorize for potential rewards.  I can't wait until initiation when they teach us the Equifax secret handshake!<br />
<br />
Anyway, Tom put on a presentation, and then fielded questions.  He did a good job on both, I thought.  But he didn't answer every question.  He didn't answer the ones that we didn't have the balls to ask in the first place:<br />
<br />
<br />
<ul><li>We notice that there is only one minority and one woman on each of the pages of the annual report with the executives and board members.  Would you care to comment?</li><br />
<br />
<li>You're from Atlanta.  Do you know Outkast?  Can you go, "all right all right all right all right?"</li><br />
<br />
<li>Did you kill anyone in Vietnam?  How did it feel?</li><br />
<br />
<li>How do I go about fixing the credit reports of my friends and family?</li></ul><br />
<br />
<br />
Just for the record, I only came up with two of these myself, but I won't name anyone else, since they are likely to value their employment more that I seem to.<br />

By the way Tom, have you read about the state of <a href="http://theskinnyonbenny.com/blog2/archives/27">your new urinals?</a>
