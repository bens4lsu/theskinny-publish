I caught just a minute of the Jim Rome show yesterday, and he had listeners emailing sports-related haikus.  It didn't sound too challenging, so I thought I would make up some about my local sports life.  <br />
<br />
<blockquote>Nick Saban is gone.<br>Will we continue to win?<br>Only time will tell.</blockquote>
<span class="spanEndPreview">&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><blockquote>"Consistency" does<br>Not accurately portray<br>They play of the Saints.</blockquote><br />
<br />
<blockquote>Football is over.<br>What will I watch Saturday?<br>Long time 'til August.</blockquote><br />
<br />
<br />
It turns out that haikus about sports come pretty easily.  Let me try some, inspired by work.<br />
<br />
<blockquote>My spec is not done.<br>Too many distractions here.<br>Will my project fail?</blockquote><br />
<br />
<blockquote>All I can hear is<br>Cell phones playing tinny tunes.<br>Turn your ringers off.</blockquote><br />
<br />
<blockquote>No one that I've met<br>Who is from California<br>Has a good hair style.</blockquote><br />
<br />
Those were easy too.  So, I conclude that haikus are easy, and not nearly as much fun as limericks.  I liked putting together my other <a href="/x/Lyms.php">limerick page</a>.  Here's one more that I came up with while lying in bed this morning.<br />
<br />
<blockquote>Louisiana is much too hot<br>Nuts tend to sweat a lot<br>Boxer-briefs are a must<br>And ointment is a plus<br>To avoid a painful crotch-rot</blockquote><br />
