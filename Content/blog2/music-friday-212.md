Would it be fun to make these music videos a regular feature?  Maybe I can have a post ready for you every Friday morning, to kick off your last work day before the weekend.

Or, maybe I'll never do this again.  Too early to tell.

Today, I've got Azealia Banks.  I never listen to a pop radio station, so I don't know if she's a household-name superstar or still an unknown.  But if all her tunes are this good, she'll be superstar in about 10 minutes.

Lyrics aren't safe for work, but the video is fine, so just plug in the earbuds if you're around others.  I'll look for something family-friendly for next week.
