It's difficult to google up a video from the Scottish band The View.  You get a lot of clips of politicians being falsely cordial with this group of bitchy old women who have a television show by that name.

But you remember the band, right?  They had a hit with "Wasted Little DJs" in '06.

Yeah, I don't remember them either.  If I had heard them before this week, then it was stored in a brain cell that was subsequently exploded by booze.  But they've dominated my Spotify time since I discovered one of their songs earlier this week.

I am pretty sure that this is better that what I was actually listening to in '06.
