When I was in 3rd or 4th grade, the teacher read to us in class a little bit from _Harriet the Spy_.  But then one day before she finished, she stopped, telling us that the book was available in the library.  I wanted to know what happened so badly, but I never checked it out because I thought it was a "girl's book."

Kids are fucking stupid, and despite the opinion of my mom, I was no exception.

It's not like it haunted me over the years or anything, but I never did find out what happened until they made the movie of it.  That was 1996, so I probably didn't see it until 1997, when I would have turned 26.

So anyway, RIP Michelle Trachtenberg.
