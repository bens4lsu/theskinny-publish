If you can believe it, it's been a couple of years since we spent all day at a festival.  Last Spring, we were away, and then this year has either been too expensive for the amount of time we could spend there (Hogs) or seemed too lame (everything in Baton Rouge).

Until this past weekend, when we made it back to French Quarter Festival.  Our day out there is pretty much a routine now.

We start at Jackson Square.  The attraction there is the roasted duck po-boy, and almost every year, I sit there enjoying the food but worry that I'm missing a better show on a different stage.  This year, we were watching Don Vappie, and he was pretty entertaining.  Double winner.

From there, we went to the cajun stage and watched the Lemon Spots, who were also a lot of fun.  This stage is great, but it's on a huge hot asphalt lot.  If they would just cover the whole lot in straw or something, it would be 15 degrees more comfortable out there.  While here, we got a killer chicken sandwich.  

I saw some turkey legs that were gigantic, roasted and smokey smelling.  They had been split along the bone and filled with shrimp in some sort of creamy sauce.  It was enough food for a giant, and has to be the best deal at the festival.

Bunch of pics...

This next guy isn't me, but I did open my shirt after bringing some shrimp and grits over to Kolya.  "Grits out, tits out!"  This guy is with me.

I spent Sunday doing boat stuff while Mrs. theskinnyonbenny went back out and had a great time at some of the smaller stages.  From there on, the only photos in my roll are pictures of boat parts.  I should make a collage.
