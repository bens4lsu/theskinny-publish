<a href="http://theskinnyonbenny.com/x/quotefile.php">My own quote file</a> was once one of my favorite pages on the site.  I've shamefully neglected it while bringing up other content.  It's one of the few pages that still has very sloppy formatting, and it even got accidentally omitted from the menu on the left when I rewrote that code.  I just added a new quote, but that's the first one in a while.<br />
<br />
What reminded me of this is that I just stumbled on an email that I had gotten a few months ago.  One of my coworkers sent me her list of quotes, for my amusement.  It doesn't say so on the page, but I have a couple of rules for my quote file.  First, it's only things I hear, not things that I say.  Second, I have to hear or read it for myself.  That make the web log the appropriate place for this list.<br />

-- "Date Rape" Dan, APPRO Sales Manager years ago.  (Note:  I'm withholding Date Rape Dan's real last name for now.  He was so inept that I might just write a whole post about this guy some day.  Just to frighten you, he's now influential in our state's government. <br />

I might be pushing my luck.  My next few posts won't make fun of coworkers in any way whatsoever.<br />
