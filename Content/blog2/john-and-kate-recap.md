Call me gay (again), but I spent this morning working while listening to a recap of last night's John and Kate Plus Eight.  I didn't see the whole thing, but I caught the cringe-inducing last ten minutes, where they sat untouching on their standard small sofa.  I didn't know at the time that it has only been a couple of weeks since they actually sat in front of the camera, throwing back and forth comments that just barely veiled their mutual hatred.  I can't imagine how awkward it must have been to be there, because I could barely watch it.

The radio people's consensus was that Kate is a diva, spending her time traveling, teeth whitening, and tanning, while John is the good guy, albeit a good guy who would prefer to spend more time playing golf and going to the beach.  I think this was mostly based on the beginning -- which I didn't watch, so I'll just believe it -- the same way that I believed that Barak Obama was to be sworn in on the Koran just because someone I don't know said it was so.

I tell you what, if a network wanted to get a reality show that featured a healthy dose of cute kid stuff punctuated by parents on each others' nerves, they should find homes with three year olds who are doing major remodeling.  Not that I speak from experience or anything; I just think that might make for good TV.

One more note:  Kate now sports the "reverse mullet" hairstyle, which we first observed on Dewey Coulon by <a href="http://incoherentblog.com" target="_blank">Tyler</a>.  Business in back, party in the front.  Ohhh yeah.
