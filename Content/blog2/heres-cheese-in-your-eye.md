A little while back, I sent this pic to some of my family and asked them to guess what's happening, and what events lead to this pose.  All of the necessary information is right there in the picture.  

<a class="lightview centered" href="/img/kolyacheeseeye.jpg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="/img/kolyacheeseeye.jpg" alt="/img/kolyacheeseeye.jpg"><br><span class="caption"></span></a>

I received no responses, which I take to mean that they can't figure it out.  Here's the answer: 

The answer is probably obvious to some of you.  The slicing of the onions burned Kolya's eyes, and he thought that cheese -- being wonderful -- would be the antidote.  He shoves cheese in his eyes to ease the onion burn.

Now that you know, it's obvious, isn't it?
