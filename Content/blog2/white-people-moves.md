description: If I ever have a time machine, I'm not going to bother trying to kill Adolph Hitler as a baby.  I don't even speak German.  Instead, I'm going to find the animator who drew this kid and tell them that the future people of 2026 will be using their animation to insult bad dancers.  I wonder what the reaction would be.

If I ever have a time machine, I'm not going to bother trying to kill Adolph Hitler as a baby.  I don't even speak German.  Instead, I'm going to find the animator who drew this kid and tell them that the future people of 2026 will be using their animation to insult bad dancers.  I wonder what the reaction would be.

The week between Christmas and New Year's, we picked up our friend Chris at the airport.  The mission was to do New Orleans tourist stuff for a few days, so we started with a cocktail and then headed to Kermit Ruffins's Mother In Law Lounge for the show.

I seem to remember the expression, "Higher than giraffe pussy," and Kermit certainly lived up to that description.  Toward the end of the show, he had stepped aside to watch his band jam while the people dance.  Mrs. theskinnyonbenny was coming back out to the show from the bar area, and she said to him, "Man, Kermit.  You're the white people whisperer."

He replied, "I got all those motherfuckers dancin' like Charlie Brown."
