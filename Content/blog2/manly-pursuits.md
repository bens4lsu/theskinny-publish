This morning, I relit the pilot light on our water heater.  I've never lit a pilot light before, and I'm not ashamed to admit that I feel a bit more like a real man than I did yesterday.

It's not even that hard, although I did have to read the instructions printed on the side of the heater.

Speaking of manly pursuits, no one has hit me up to fill out an NCAA tournament bracket yet.  If you're running a pool, and need your pot to be $5 to $20 higher, let me know.  Don't worry, there's almost no chance that I'll actually take any money home.  I've been filling them out since I was a tot, and I've yet to win or even finish in the money.
