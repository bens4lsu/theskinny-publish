Well, that snapshot of my own butt in my last post got me more feedback than anything since I described <a href="http://www.theskinnyonbenny.com/blog/archives/00000062.php">my argument</a> with a four-year old.  It reminds me that I told a story last week where my butt was a central figure.  Fear not; this post is not illustrated.
<!--more--><br /><br />When my nephew was around 6 or so, someone dropped off some wet and stick on tattoos for him.  He wasn't around when they were received, so I decided to take one of the tattoos and put it on an ass cheek.  <br />
<br />
The idea was that when he came to proudly show off his new tattoo, I could say, "Wow, I have one just like that!"  Then, I could drop my pants and get a big laugh.  Everyone knows that six year old boys (and I) find butt cheeks amazingly funny.<br />
<br />
Mrs. theskinnyonbenny bought into this fun little prank, and agreed to administer the tattoo to my butt.  <br />
<br />
All of this occurred while vacationing with my family.  We were in some smallish beach condo somewhere or other, so we went in a bathroom to apply the tattoo.<br />
<br />
Just as I had my shorts around my ankles, and Mrs. theskinnyonbenny had her face right in my butt, the bathroom door opened.  I turned around to see my dad, who immediately stammered an "Excuse me" and shut the door very quickly.<br />
<br />
Let's pause to consider what sort of perverted scene he thought he walked into.  I can't even imagine.  I mean, I know that there are married couples who like to spice it up with really weird twists, but <br />
<br />
As I recall, we had only been back to the condo for five minutes or so, so the imagined scenario had to include the fact that we just couldn't wait to stick something on/in my butt while we were out.  Was I particularly squirmy at dinner?  Did my attention wander?<br />
<br />
Later, the intended joke went over swimmingly.<br />
<br />
I bet I'm a fun uncle to have.
