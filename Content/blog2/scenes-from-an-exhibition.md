The weekend before last, I worked harder than I ever have during a weekend.  We went to the Realtors' convention in New Orleans to launch <a href="http://mytechpurse.com">MyTechPurse</a>, which is (if you're listening search engines) the best place to find out how to build and maintain a great web site, integrate social media, and build an internet marketing strategy that works.  It's a must for any small business.

Also, there's a blog on that site, so for those who can't get enough of my wit and wisdom on this site, there's more for you to read over there.

Of all of the small booths, I think ours was the most memorable.  My friend <a href="http://www.enviousinvites.com">Mendi</a> created a "Fire Your Nerd" graphic to hang on the back of the booth for us.  The banner caught every eye that passed.  You could see the faces catch the glance, laugh, and often stop to find out more.

He let me pose for a pic.  Turns out, <a href="http://www.facebook.com/#!/album.php?aid=113139&id=654239363" target="_blank">that's his thing</a>.</td></tr>

<tr><td class="caption">Some big exhibitors would have D-list celebrities posing for pictures.  David Hasslehoff had on so much makeup that he looked like a dude in a plastic Hasslehoff mask.  This is a far-away shot of Bill Walton mugging for Sam's.</td><td class="caption">This guy in the HP booth across from us is NOT <a href="http://www.thedailyshow.com/news-team/aasif-mandvi" target="_blank">Aasif Mandvi</a>, but he sure looks like him.</td></tr>

There are a few other shots from this trip as daily photos from <a href="http://theskinnyonbenny.com/dailyphoto/2010/page.php?year=2010&month=11&day=11">November 11</a> to <a href="http://theskinnyonbenny.com/dailyphoto/2010/page.php?year=2010&month=11&day=14">November 14</a>.

I've got one other friend who deserves a world of thanks, but I won't mention the name here, as some of the help was off the books, and I don't want anyone to get in trouble (not that anyone ever reads this who doesn't know us already).  But I owe him bigmuch.
