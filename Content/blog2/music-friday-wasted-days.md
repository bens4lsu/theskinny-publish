Just about the only thing I've listened to this week is Cloud Nothings's <i>Attack on Memory</i> album.  And the track I keep going back to is Wasted Days.

Back in the 70s, our shelf was full of rock albums with complicated tunes that lasted way longer than anything you would ever get on the radio.  Sometimes, the end of the song didn't sound like the same tune as the beginning, and sometimes it would go through all sorts of complicated permutations and circle back around to something that reminded you of the front.  I remember that Inna Godda Divida took the entire side.  (Homework for the kids: look up what "33 1/3" refers to.)

This tune clocks in at just under 9 minutes, and there's not one second that I would have trimmed if I were the sound mixer.

On a site note, I think I'm going to go back to the yahoo player, like this one here.  Let me know if you have problems with it.  I'm also going to start with the quick-links to Amazon.  If you don't see that here, you should click your ad-block's icon and tell it to allow ones from theskinnyonbenny.  It will just be links for the music I post here.  (Unless I try one of these penis enlargement pills that actually works.  Then, I'll post links for that too.)
