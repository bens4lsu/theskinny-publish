One day early last week, I was listening to a radio show out of Washington DC on an internet stream.  Somehow, it came up that one of the hosts hasn't french kissed his wife in a decade.  A younger, unmarried producer in the studio found that hard to believe, and they argued a bit about whether that was typical.

Then, they took a poll by text message.  Since I was sitting at the computer anyway, I sent a text in.

Your browswer won&#8217;t allow embedded media.  Sorry.</noembed>

It's hard to understand their read.  It says, "I've been married 12 years.  My Basset Hound gets her tongue in my mouth more often that my wife does."

I enjoyed the appreciation that I got in response to my own kissing experience.

Notice that I didn't actually answer the question at all.  It might be that Blossom sneaks that tongue in there twice a day, and Mrs. theskinnyonbenny isn't quite as sneaky.  Or, I could be going on a decade just like that radio host.

And we'll just leave that little bit of mystery out there for you to ponder.
