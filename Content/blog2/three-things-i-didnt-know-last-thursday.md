I spent all day Friday and Saturday on an errand that kept me in the car all day.  Here are three things I learned from two straight days of talk radio.

<ul><li><i>Joanie Loves Chachi</i> was the highest rated American show to ever play in South Korea.  "Chachi" sounds like the Korean word for "penis."</li>

<li>There is an episode of <i>Three's Company</i> where you get a quick shot of John Ritter's scrotum.  It wasn't noticed by anyone, until a viewer in the Tivo era slowed it down enough to see for sure.  No word on why anyone would Tivo <i>Three's Company</i> reruns</li>

<li>When NASA first sent scientists into outer space, they found out that ink pens wouldn't work.  Over the course of years, the government spent $12 million to make a pen that would work upside down, in zero gravity, and in all kinds of temperature extremes.

The Russians switched to pencils.

I'm not too sure about the accuracy of this particular story, but it's what I heard.</li></ul>
