(Note:  there's a straightforward translation of the card that belongs here, but the image won't show up, and I don't see any apparent reason why not.  I don't feel like troubleshooting html code, especially since this image isn't part of the gag, so imagine it for yourself.)</p></div><br />

Not ones to allow our clients to go ungreeted, we sent a greeting from our team's director....</p></div><br />
