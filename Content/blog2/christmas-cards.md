<div><p>We received this card from a client this week...</p></div>

<div><center><img src="/img/xmascard.jpg"/></center></div>
<span class="spanEndPreview">&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><div><p>As our Spanish-speaking cohort was away on vacation, we relied on the internet for a translation...</p></div>

<div><center><img src="/img/translation.jpg"/></center></div>

<div><p>This was honestly the translation that one particular site thought was the answer.  Another site revealed this one...

(Note:  there's a straightforward translation of the card that belongs here, but the image won't show up, and I don't see any apparent reason why not.  I don't feel like troubleshooting html code, especially since this image isn't part of the gag, so imagine it for yourself.)</p></div>

<div><p>...although this similar-looking page that Tyler found came up with this one ...</p></div>

<div><p>As you may have gathered, the company did not send out team-specific Christmas greetings to our clients this year.  I might be too egotistic here, but I like to think that my <a href="http://www.theskinnyonbenny.com/blog/archives/00000082.php">ridicule from last year</a> made us more gun-shy than we would otherwise be.

Not ones to allow our clients to go ungreeted, we sent a greeting from our team's director....</p></div>

<div><p>While we're sharing photoshoped pictures of Steve, here's one from earlier in the year, which is certainly my favorite of the collection.</p></div>

Merry Christmas everyone!
