We received this card from a client this week...

<a class="lightview centered" href="/img/xmascard.jpg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="/img/xmascard.jpg" alt="/img/xmascard.jpg"><br><span class="caption"></span></a>

As our Spanish-speaking cohort was away on vacation, we relied on the internet for a translation...

<a class="lightview centered" href="/img/translation.jpg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="/img/translation.jpg" alt="/img/translation.jpg"><br><span class="caption"></span></a>

This was honestly the translation that one particular site thought was the answer.  Another site revealed this one...

(Note:  there's a straightforward translation of the card that belongs here, but the image won't show up, and I don't see any apparent reason why not.  I don't feel like troubleshooting html code, especially since this image isn't part of the gag, so imagine it for yourself.)

...although this similar-looking page that Tyler found came up with this one ...

<a class="lightview centered" href="/img/translation3.jpg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="/img/translation3.jpg" alt="/img/translation3.jpg"><br><span class="caption"></span></a>

As you may have gathered, the company did not send out team-specific Christmas greetings to our clients this year.  I might be too egotistic here, but I like to think that my <a href="/blog2/archives/82">ridicule from last year</a> made us more gun-shy than we would otherwise be.

Not ones to allow our clients to go ungreeted, we sent a greeting from our team's director....

<a class="lightview centered" href="/img/helmke2.jpg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="/img/helmke2.jpg" alt="/img/helmke2.jpg"><br><span class="caption"></span></a>

While we're sharing photoshoped pictures of Steve, here's one from earlier in the year, which is certainly my favorite of the collection.

<a class="lightview centered" href="/img/Stevo.jpg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="/img/Stevo.jpg" alt="/img/Stevo.jpg"><br><span class="caption"></span></a>

Merry Christmas everyone!
