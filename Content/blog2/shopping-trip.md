Yesterday, my mom was walking through Wal Mart with my son.

He asked, "What's that Maw Maw?"

They had just passed a rack of socks and underwear.  Knowing that he's big on socks, shoes, and gloves, she answered, "You know what those are.  They're just socks."
<span class="spanEndPreview">&nbsp;</span>
"Noooo Maw Maw.  Those are boobies!"

She turned to see a big rack of padded bras.

An older woman passing near by heard this and said to my mother in a disgusted tone, "Men.  They're born that way."
