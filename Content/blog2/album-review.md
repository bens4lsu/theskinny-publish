I just heard the <a href="http://www.rslblog.com/2008/02/maxim-magazine-grades-and-pans-new.html" target="_blank">story</a> about how Maxim gave the new Black Crows album 2 1/2 stars out of 5, despite having never bothered listening to the album.

Truth be told, I'm sure they were right.  No one comes back after 7 years and has an album that you could even call "pretty good."  And it's not like the Black Crows were reeling off great albums one after another, even in their heyday.  In fact, their biggest hit is a cover of an Otis Redding classic.  They might be the very best band whose biggest hit is a cover, but that's not exactly an elite fraternity.

The band is understandably bitter.  

How could the writer think he would get away with this, when the album hadn't been released, even to record reviewers?  And the editor who allowed that to run is a hack.  I will be checking to see how long they stay employed.
