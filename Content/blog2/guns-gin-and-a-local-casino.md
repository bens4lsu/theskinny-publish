Earlier this week, I saw a guy at the gym who had an interesting tattoo on his bicep.  It looked something like this:

Do I really need to make fun of this?  I think it just stands as funny on its own.  I will, however, let you know when this guy kicks my ass for making fun of him on the internet.

Last Friday night, at around 11:00, we were sitting outside in the back yard having drinks and shooting the shit.  We had cooked some fish a number of hours earlier (which were delicious, by the way) and were several drinks into the night. 

Mrs. theskinnyonbenny asked that I fix her a gin and tonic.  That's a new drink for her, but I agreed to go ahead and fix it.  I knew the gin bottle was green, so I poured it over ice, and added liquid from the can next to the bottle.

"What are you making?" Sharples asked me.  He had kind of an incredulous tone in his voice.

I looked down at the hand with the can, and I was actually pouring Black Cherry Fresca.  I don't know where the heck Black Cherry Fresca came from, but that's what I was pouring, sure enough.

"Oh, so I guess she gets Gin and Black Cherry Fresca.  That shouldn't be too bad."

"No dude.  What did you pour from that bottle?"

I gave the green bottle a close inspection, and found that it was the smaller green bottle.  That is, it was olive oil, left out from when we had cooked fish rather than the larger green bottle, which was the gin.

"Mmmmm.  Olive oil and Black Cherry Fresca.  That can't be good."  I gave it a little taste.  Other than being greasy, it wasn't too awful.  "Let's serve it to her!"

I started to walk toward Mrs. theskinnyonbenny, but I found myself unable to wipe the shit-eating grin off my face.  Sharples had to take it over there and serve it while I pretended to look for a dropped bottle cap on the ground.

Yes, we actually served up an Olive oil and Black Cherry Fresca and let her drink it.  I am such a dick.

I've entered the ranks of casino-going high rollers.  I received a card in the mail that entitles me to two free room at the casino's hotel.

But there are different levels of high-rollers, and I'm clearly on the very very bottom rung.  Here's how I know.

First the coupon is for the <a href="http://www.harrahs.com/casinos/horseshoe-bossier-city/hotel-casino/property-home.shtml" target="_blank">Horseshoe Casino in Bossier City, LA</a>.  Not exactly the Bellagio.

Then, I'm only allowed to the first of my free nights between September 4 and September 18.  And I'm only allowed to use the second of my free nights between September 19 and October 10.  Here's the kicker:  my free nights have to be <i>on a school night</i>.  That's right.  If I want to go to the Horseshoe Casino in Bossier City, LA, and if it happens to be a Friday or Saturday night, I'm going to be paying full price, just like everyone else.

(I was just informed that this is actually a very nice hotel, so I'm glad that I was at least invited somewhere nice.  But still, it's Bossier City on a weekday.)

So there's no way I'll ever use this, but it's nice to in the high-roller club.  

Even if it is just the shitty high roller club.
