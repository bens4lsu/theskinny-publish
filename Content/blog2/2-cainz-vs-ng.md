I gotta start checking in on Nancy Grace again.  Her intro for 2 Chainz is the funniest clip I've seen in a while.  Also she's batshit crazy. 

If the intro isn't enough to break you up, listen to her say "Smoking a big fat doobie" at 2:12.

I know 2 Chainz music, but I've never heard an interview with him.  He's a pot defender, but clearly one of the most sane and levelheaded people on television whatever night this aired.

If you stick it out for seven minutes, she concedes that he's pretty much right and then changes the subject.

<h3>(2023 update:  This isn't the original clip.  It went offline, and I'm afraid we lost a lot of the original crazy.)</h3>
