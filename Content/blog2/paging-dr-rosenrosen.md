A month or so ago, we were driving through the LSU campus, and there were two university club teams playing that fake sport from Harry Potter with the broomsticks.  I only saw what I could glimpse as I passed from a moving car, but they definitely had a few spectators and two teams running around on their sticks.

Nerds.

I won't be seeing the new Harry Potter movie this weekend.  I read the first of the books and determined that they aren't really my cup of tea.  I think I would prefer the movies, but having seen none of them, I won't be in line this weekend for the next.

Truth be told, I'm entering the phase of old manhood where I'd pretty much prefer rewatching movies that I've seen a hundred times than going to the theater.  Mrs. theskinnyonbenny is leaving town this weekend, and I'm so looking forward to putting Vanya to bed, turning out the lights, getting butt naked, opening a pint of ice cream, and watching Fletch on the couch late at night.  I'm almost giddy at the thought.

Streaming movies of your choice on demand should be a technology that's farther along than it is.  Netflix offers what I'm looking for, but their selection of movies that are available for streaming is frustratingly poor.  Amazon has more movies, but you have to pay per stream, and then you only have 24 hours to watch once you've started the movie.  A couple of months ago, I had to race through Casino Royale to get to the closing credits before my 24 hour deadline expired.

The technology is there to set you up with an account where you pay a monthly fee and are allowed to watch whatever you want, as much as you want.  And everyone would sign up for such a service.  I'm even willing to wait until after the DVD run and after the HBO/Starz exclusive run to have them show up.  But after that, every movie ever made should be there.  The money the studios bank from this would certainly outweigh the fee they get from USA Network to show an edited, bleeped version.
