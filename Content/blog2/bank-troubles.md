Say you're a big, giant financial corporation, and you suffer through a year with headlines like these:

<div><a href="http://www.localnewsleader.com/elytimes/stories3/index.php?action=fullnews&id=240481" target="_blank">Capital One 4Q profit falls 42 percent</a></div>

<div><a href="http://www.forbes.com/markets/2007/08/21/capital-one-mortgage-markets-equity-cx_er_0821markets09.html
" target="_blank">Capital One Exits Mortgage Business</a></div>

<div><a href="http://www.businessweek.com/investor/content/apr2007/pi20070420_201721.htm?chan=rss_topStories_ssi_5" target="_blank">S&P Downgrades Capital One Shares</a></div>

<div><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/11/08/AR2007110802349_pf.html" target="_blank">Capital One Stock Suffers</a></div>
<!--more-->
So what's the big corp to do?

Well, if you can't make your numbers, how about hiring an expert in making it appear that your numbers are better than they really are?  Perhaps an expert in "data manipulation."  This ran in this past Sunday's Baton Rouge paper.
