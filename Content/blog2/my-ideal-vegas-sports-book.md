Dry eyes, nosebleeds, itchy skin.  You guess it!  It's time to go to Las Vegas.<br />
<br />
I imagine that I will spend a good percentage of my time in a sports book.  I've spent a lot of time in them over the years, and I've yet to find one that meets all of my criteria for an "ideal" sports book.<br />
<br />
<ol><li>Free drinks.  None of this, "bet so much and you get a ticket for a free drink" crap.  Casinos set the expectation that I drink for free while I sit there and bet.  They can't change the rules on me now.  Hell, I tip the waitress a buck a drink, which is more than they're worth anyway.<br /><br />And while we're talking ideals and waitresses, they should be good looking.  I don't need an old hag bringing me my drink in the ideal sports book.</li>
<!--more--><br /><br /><li>I need huge screens, and seating situated so that I can see a bunch of them.  This seems obvious, but you would be surprised how many sports books have two or three big screens and then a bunch of regular televisions.</li><br />
<br />
<li>A restroom close by.  I'm sometimes at these things by myself for hours.  I don't need the hassle of pocketing all my stuff and marching nine miles to the can just to get back and find my seat taken.  Have a john right there, for goodness sakes.</li><br />
<br />
<li>Food close by.  Same principal.  Just because it's halftime of one game doesn't mean that a horserace isn't about to start.  I don't have time to march to the food court.  Sell me a pretzel right then and there.</li><br />
<br />
<li>I think you should be able to place your bets by machine.  I don't like the crusty old people who take your money.  I'm much happier giving my money to electronics.</li><br />
<br />
<li>I like the ones that give you a personal TV right there at your chair.  That small touch makes it so much easier to follow the many teams, people, and horses who are simultaneously competing for my money.</li><br />
<br />
<li>All of these things above, you can find here or there (although I don't know of one that meets all of these criteria.  Now, let's keep going with the wish list:  reclining chairs.  Isn't this obvious?  Not a Lazy Boy or anything, but something like new movie theaters have.  Maybe something like that, but with a foot rest.  You know I'm on to something genius.</li><br />
<br />
<li>My true ideal room would have no dress code.  No -- I haven't been kicked out of one for wearing shorts or a t-shirt, but while I'm dreaming, I would like one where they would be cool with me just showing up in a bathrobe.  It's not going to happen, but that's how mine would be run.</li></ol><br />
<br />
I suppose one day Louisiana will authorize the creation of legal sports betting establishments.  If that happens, I want to be first in line to open a place to do it.  It will have all of these features, plus really good chicken wings.
