I was in a convenience store today, and a young guy came in wearing black pants with pinstripes and a Ruth's Chris t-shirt.  I couldn't hear the clerk, but his side of the conversation went like this.

<blockquote>Gimme a skoal.
<br>
<br>Yeah, just one.
<br>
<br>They told me I can't smoke at work no more.
<br>
<br>So I gotta dip instead.
<br>
<br>For some reason they think it's better for me to spit in the kitchen than go outside and smoke.
<br>
<br>It's disgusting.</blockquote>

Yeah, I'll say it is.
