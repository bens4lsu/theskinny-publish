I was in a convenience store today, and a young guy came in wearing black pants with pinstripes and a Ruth's Chris t-shirt.  I couldn't hear the clerk, but his side of the conversation went like this.

<blockquote>Gimme a skoal.

Yeah, just one.

They told me I can't smoke at work no more.

So I gotta dip instead.

For some reason they think it's better for me to spit in the kitchen than go outside and smoke.

It's disgusting.</blockquote>

Yeah, I'll say it is.
