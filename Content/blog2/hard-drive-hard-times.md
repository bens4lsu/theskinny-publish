A couple of weeks ago, I had an external hard drive go bad.  That's bad news for me, because it's the one I use for both my main laptop's backups and also my music/movie file storage.  Not a huge deal -- I always keep two copies of everything -- but I definitely need it back in service.

The drive was under warranty, so got the return info online.  I packed it up with bubble wrap, taped on my return label, and drove over to the post office.  There, I did the scale and bought the stamp.  Then, I dropped it in the box catcher (whatever it's really called).

Today, I was looking for something in my bag, and I found the hard drive, just chilling out at the bottom under a secondary laptop, a bag of sunflower seeds, and an emergency pair of socks.  I'm not sure what I mailed back to Seagate.  Probably just an empty box full of bubble wrap.

What a donkey.
