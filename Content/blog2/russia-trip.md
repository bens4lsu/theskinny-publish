Perhaps you heard (or maybe you caught it two posts ago) that we were recently in Russia. You can probably guess what we were doing, but unlike 2007, when we did something similar, we've been asked not to publicly share stories, details, or pictures.

Still, our friends know what they know, and it would be nice to be able to post some news when there's news to post. So Ive added some info pages here, but I put them behind a password wall.  If you're a legit friend, let me know that your interested (text, email, whatever), and I'll be happy to share.

Hopefully, in a few months everything will be done and will have gone smoothly.  If that's the case, I'll get rid of the password wall.
