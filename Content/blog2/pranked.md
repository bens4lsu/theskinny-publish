A couple of weeks ago, Mrs. theskinnyonbenny and I both got this text message.

<a class="lightview centered" href="/img/mysterytext.jpg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="/img/mysterytext.jpg" alt="/img/mysterytext.jpg" width="350px"><br><span class="caption"></span></a>

We had just had a free dress day for V, and they don't really use a text system, so we let K pick out his clothes and packed him off to school on Friday.  In the drop off line, he said, "There's Anna.  She's not in free dress."

I said, "I guess her parents didn't get the message."  How right I was.

The school didn't care, but K was super self conscious and had a little bit of a meltdown.  It probably didn't help that he had a substitute teacher that day.

This was a masterful prank on theskinnyonbenny family, and we still don't know who to credit.  We ruled out V's school, and either kid's previous school.

The friend with the most evil inclinations (Shelly) denies responsibility and is convincing.  Plus, she probably wouldn't make the kid suffer embarrassment just to inconvenience the rest of us.

I'm honestly baffled.  If you have any idea, please send it along.
