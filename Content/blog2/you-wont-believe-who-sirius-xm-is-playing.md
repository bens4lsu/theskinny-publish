On Saturday, I heard something that I had never heard before:  Floyd Cramer on the radio.

Back in the early 90s, if you turned on mid-day TV for any amount of time at all, you were sure to see the commercial for a Floyd Cramer, playing a collection of other people's hits as piano instrumentals.

Wait... Here it is.  I went and found it in 10 seconds.  I'm starting to think this internet thing isn't just a fad after all.

On Saturday, we had just the right combination of time and luck.  Had we taken my car instead of Mrs. theskinnyonbenny's, we would have been tuned to a different station.  Had we not turned back to make sure she didn't leave the hair press on, I might have been flipping channels. 

(I don't know the name of the device, but it's like a set of electrically hot tongs that prettify the female hair in some way or other.)

Ultimately, I find myself driving down Acadian Thruway, listening to Floyd Cramer, and trying not to laugh.  Part of me wants to laugh because I'm thinking of the lewd Floyd Cramer jokes that I used to make back when this commercial ran all day every day.  But I'm suppressing the laugh, because I know that Mrs. theskinnyonbenny will be thinking, "Are you fucking kidding me?  He's laughing about Floyd Cramer penis jokes that weren't funny when he made them 20 years ago?"

That might be the only drawback of marrying the person you were dating when you were nineteen.  You can't just brush off an old laugh with, "Well, you really had to have been there."  She actually was there.

After the song, the radio host explained that ol' Floyd started out with Louisiana Hayride, and that he was the session pianist for most of Elvis's hits along with tons of other rock and country acts back in the day.  Who would have guessed?

All of us would have known, if his commercial should have told us.
