There's an art shop in my neighborhood.  Look at these cute little paintings, each with the name of a different neighborhood in the area.

But uh oh, the shop is in the neighborhood named Capital Heights.  And hey -- I live in Capital Heights.  Where's the Capital Heights painting!?

They're ugly paintings anyway.
