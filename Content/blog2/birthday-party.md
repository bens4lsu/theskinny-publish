Saturday morning, the family got up, got dressed and went to my nephew's 2-year-old birthday party.

The party was at 9:00 AM, and at a town an hour away.

To me, that was great.  A 9:00 AM party isn't going to be "what I did today."  It's just going to be "one of the things that I did today."  I got to see the whole fam, and then roll on to do other things, which included some good crawfish, a drink at the yacht club, and a visit to the rooftop bar at Luna Cucina.  That's close to home, and it's been open a year or more.  A shame that we haven't visited before.

But as I poured a mimosa (thanks for thinking of that Barf!), I was thinking about who was secretly most bitter about being up so early.

1.  My mom, who has always been a night owl, but now stays up all night watching garbage TV and ususally sleeps until noon.

2.  Mrs. theskinnyonbenny.  We had been sitting outside on Friday, watching the LSU baseball game and on a video call with Crystal and Camilla.  I pulled the "pee and flee," aka the Irish goodbye, and ducked out without a word after the game was over.  They stayed up until 3:30 AM.

3.  Leb, the college freshman, on the last Saturday of Spring Break.  He might be our winner.

Ko noted that the birthday boy wasn't even old enough that he would remember the party later in life.  I wonder what the effect on a person would be if you were to withold fun experiences until you knew the kid was old enough to remember it in adulthood.

Mrs. theskinnyonbenny pointed out that the birtday boy has no idea who we even are, which is also a funny point.

Fortunately, the family accounting department was so busy tracking how many donut holes and cupcakes the baby could eat, that I got to have my fill in peace.

Also, we are all dumb asses who didn't take a picture even though we had the whole family at the same place at the same time, and even though Mom stated directly that she wanted to take a picture.
