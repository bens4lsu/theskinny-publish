One drawback of working from home, is the interruption that occurs at the end of the afternoon when the kids get home from school.  Yesterday, I heard Vanya at the bottom of the stairs saying this.

"Don't go up there, Kolya.  Papa's trying to work.  Don't you want money to buy toys?  Then don't go up there.  If you go up there, we won't have any money to buy toys."
