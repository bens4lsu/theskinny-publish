Here are three related things that happened today, all of which indicate that I'm older than dirt.
<ul>
<li>While brushing my teeth this morning, I tweaked my back.  For you youngsters who don't understand that terminology, the muscles suddenly (and somewhat violently) seize up and become painful and tight.</li>
<li>To sooth my back, I turned on the seat heater for my morning drive.  This wasn't uncomfortable, because despite being about 70 degrees, it was windy and overcast, and that felt a little cool.</li>
<li>When I got up around lunch time, my back was really quite stiff and sore.  I decided to walk two blocks to a convenience store to pick up a pack of Aleve.  I walked down, fixed a big giant diet coke, picked up a pack of Cheese-its for good measure, and totally forgot about the Aleve.</li></ul>

Kolya is pretty much past the toddler stage where he has cute mispronunciations of words.  These are the only ones left that I an think of:

<b>pan-a-cake</b>:  There's a mix-up between the pat-a-cake and the pancake breakfast food.  This word encompasses both.
<b>applecado</b>:  That green vegetable that you mush up to make guacamole.  There's also some confusion between this and the jalapeno, as he touched a tiny bit of avocado to his lips and then claimed that he needed something to drink in order to relieve the burning.
<b>yogrit</b>:  Yogurt.  He's gotten pretty much everyone in the house saying it this way.  Vanya might have even come around to thinking that this is the correct pronunciation.
