A few years ago, I created <a href="http://www.pandora.com/?sc=sh99121514412040048&shareImp=true" target="_blank">a Pandora station, mixing Washington DC go go artists with New Orleans funk bands</a> -- close musical cousins to be sure.  The first name I typed in to start the station was Chuck Brown.

Last Friday, the creator of <i>Treme</i> and <i>The Wire</i> brought <a href="http://www.offbeat.com/2012/05/15/treme-vs-the-wire-battle-of-the-bands-at-tipitinas-photos/" target="_blank">the genres together in a much more impressive way</a>.  

Coincidentally, this week saw the passing of Brown.  Rest in peace, and thanks for the tunes (RIPATFTT).

The ratio of hyperlinks to actual text in this post should be adequate to make this look like a spam blog, so my apologies to anyone who found his way here looking for a simple way to enlarge his penis.
