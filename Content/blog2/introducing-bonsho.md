I am surprised that I have managed to go this long without telling any of you about my Las Vegas trip.  There are a few stories to share, but not too many.<br />
<br />
Before I get to the point on this one, I'll mention a star-spotting.  We saw Charles Barkley playing the high-limit tables at Mandalay bay.  I think it is a noble goal for me to try to get celebrities to give me quotes to post directly to this site.  I think I'll write some sort of "mission statement" for my site, and include that as something that I'm trying to do.<br />
<br />
On to our story....<br />
<br />
It came to my attention that Mandalay Bay had me registered as "Bonsho Notariano."  Bonsho.  I kind of like that.  It just so happens that I've been thinking that I need a new alias/alter ego to sign on registration books when I'm intoxicated, and that short of thing.  I really like Bonsho, but the Notariono part has to go.  I wouldn't want to accidentally incriminate any actual Notarianos who happened to be around when I used my alias.<br />
<br />
I could stay with the Italian last name:  Bonsho Corlene, Bonsho DeBenedeto, Bonsho Gianetti.  But, I have to be able to pronounce and spell my name in a pinch, so I probably won't use one of these.<br />
<br />
I kind of like Bonsho Miyagi.  That makes it sound like I could whip out a martial-arts ass-kicking, doesn't it?  Besides, it would be fun to see people wonder if I could really be a Miyagi when I introduce myself with a straight face.  That one has potential.<br />
<br />
I could go with just a one-word name.  Bonsho.  On second thought, that sounds too much like my real name.  Forget that one.<br />
<br />
Bonsho Smith or Jones?  Naahh.<br />
<br />
How about a name for a circus performer?  Bonsho The Great, or Bonsho Thegreat, so that it seems a little more realistic.<br />
<br />
Let's settle on Bonsho Miyagi for the time being.  I want to test one of the features with this web log that I haven't used yet.  You can use the voting links below to let me know how you like that new name.
