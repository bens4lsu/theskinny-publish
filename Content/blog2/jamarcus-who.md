NFL Stat of the Week:  from the <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/281102013/falcons-raiders" target="_blank">Oakland Raiders box score last Sunday</a>

77 Total yards.
14 minute and change time of possession.

That's probably the most pathetic offensive numbers I've ever seen.

Does anyone remember a game where the Saints only had the ball for 14 minutes?  Even in the heyday of thir awfulness?

While we're poking around that site, Russell's player profile says that he played his college ball at Louisiana State.  To me, if you're a reporter, web site, or broadcaster, and you call LSU "Louisiana State," you should lose your privledges for covering college sports.  Same goes if you call Ole Miss "University of Mississippi."

<h3>2026 update:  The original links were to nfl.com, but they were broken.  I found the game stats on ESPN.  When I looked at ESPN's bio page for Jamarcus, they didn't have the college quite right either.</h3>
