NFL Stat of the Week:  from the <a href="http://www.nfl.com/gamecenter?game_id=29654&season=2008&displayPage=tab_gamecenter&week=REG9" target="_blank">Oakland Raiders box score last Sunday</a>

77 Total yards.
14 minute and change time of possession<!--more-->.

That's probably the most pathetic offensive numbers I've ever seen.

Does anyone remember a game where the Saints only had the ball for 14 minutes?  Even in the heyday of thir awfulness?

While we're poking around that site, <a href="http://www.nfl.com/players/profile?id=00-0025388" target="_blank">Russell's player profile</a> says that he played his college ball at Louisiana State.  To me, if you're a reporter, web site, or broadcaster, and you call LSU "Louisiana State," you should lose your privledges for covering college sports.  Same goes if you call Ole Miss "University of Mississippi."
