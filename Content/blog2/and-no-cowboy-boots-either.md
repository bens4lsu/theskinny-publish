I woke up Vanya this morning.  He started to talk on the way down the stairs.

"Is it camp today?"

"Yeah, baseball camp, I think."

"Well, we need to go to the snack store and get marshmallows."
<!--more-->
"For what?"

"You know.  Marshmallows to go with the chocolate crackers."

"Ohhh.  That's campING.  Camp is different.  There are no chocolate crackers at camp."

I wonder why he didn't think we needed to pick up the chocolate or the graham crackers at the snack store.
