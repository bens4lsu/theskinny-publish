V uses the word "yeah-honh" a lot lately.  At least I think that's how you would spell it.  The N is silent, but you have to make the short o with a nasal sound, as if an N were about to follow.

Try it quietly to yourself.  "Yeah-honh."

It's as definitionally elegant as it is audibly horrifying.  It conveys both, "I assert the positive alternative" and "I disagree with you" in two little syllables.

Look how efficient:

"Can we eat at McDonald's tonight?"

"No."

"Yeah-honh."

If somebody can come up with a decent spelling, then this should be added to the dictionary.
