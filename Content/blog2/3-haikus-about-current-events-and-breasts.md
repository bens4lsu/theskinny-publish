Just try fitting current events, breasts, and some recognizable meaning into a paltry 17 syllables.  Try, I dare you.

Vote for the brother,
the geriatric old man,
or the one with boobs

Fighting corruption
On to the governorship
Hookers?  What's the harm?

Drinking all I should
I'm suddenly growing breasts
Drugs in our water
