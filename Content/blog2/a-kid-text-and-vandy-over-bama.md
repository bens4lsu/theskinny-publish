This morning, I woke up really early, got busy scrolling through internet garbage, and then ended up waking Ko up late.  

I drop him off downtown, where a bus takes him to his school.  This saves me a good 45 minutes, most of which is crawling through heavy traffic to get in and out of the neighborhood where his school is.  So it's very important for me to make the bus.

Ko timed his getting ready so that there was a chance to make the bus -- but only a whiff of a chance.  But wouldn't you know, we caught every green light, and when the cars started to unload so kids could make the bus, I was at the only red of the morning, watching from the other side of the street.

The light turned green, I slid in right behind the bus, and he was able to board with the last stragglers.

His strategy had been to miss the bus and then have me drop by the Starbucks before starting the long school drive.  And I 100% would have done that had he missed the bus.  But I didn't realize that he was so sure of his plan that he hadn't grabbed a bagel from the kitchen.

Until this text exchange:

Last week at this time, we were thinking that we were headed in to a ho-hum weekend in college football.  And then late in the afternoon, the whole country came together and became die hard Vanderbilt fans.

You probably know all of that, and you've seen the kids carrying the goal posts around downtown Nashville (with police escort, no less!).  But there are a couple of facts about the game that I didn't know until later in the week:

First, Vandy scored 40 points against Kalen DeBoer's first Alabama team.  They scored a _total_ of 14 points against all of Nick Saban's Alabama teams, over Saban's 17 years as coach.  (It's less amazing when I tell you that this was in 4 games, but not a lot less.)

Like everyone else, I loved watching Vandy's quarterback, Diego Pavia, play during the game.  He ran, he threw, he showed a ton of heart.  But I didn't realize at all that I was watching the [Santa Fe Tinkler](https://www.abqjournal.com/sports/nmsu-coach-disappointed-in-diego-pavia-after-urination-video-says-matter-will-be-handled-internally/article_dd7ae81a-5cb2-11ee-8fce-1b2e53fd9c9d.html).

I think that nickname is from the College Football Enquirer podcast, which is the college football podcast that you should be listening to.
