description: Remember 2019?  It was a simpler time.  Corrupt presidents got impeached.  Famous cathedrals in Paris burned like unmonitored microwave popcorn.  And we collectively shrugged off a little virus outbreak in China.  Let's do some remembering, and I have a couple of 2019 videos that have never before been seen.

Remember 2019?  It was a simpler time.  Corrupt presidents got impeached.  Famous cathedrals in Paris burned like unmonitored microwave popcorn.  And we collectively shrugged off a little virus outbreak in China.

LSU put together the best college football team ever assembled with a bunch of college students who are household names today.  And I mostly abandoned making any sort of updates to theskinnyonbenny.com

A couple of years ago, when it was time to either decide to rebuild this whole exercise in personal amusement or to shut it down altogether, I opted for the former.  One of the things I did was pull all of my videos off of Vimeo and move them to YouTube, which had the great advantage of being free.

As part of that process, I found two videos on Vimeo that I had never even embedded in a page.  So sit back, fix a skinny girl margarita, and pretend it's 2019 all over again, while enjoying these two clips rescued from video purgatory.
