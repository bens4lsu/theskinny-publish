For the past week or so, I've been blowing giant boogers.

I'm not sure what it is.  Maybe a little touch of a cold.  I've also been getting nosebleeds, so they're dark with clotted blood.  In fact, I have a lot of trouble blowing the boogers out without starting a new nosebleed.  That leads to new dried giant boogers.  It's a disgusting cycle that I can't seem to shake.

This morning, I blew my nose, and disposed of what came out.  Except for one giant booger which hitched itself to the coller of my t-shirt, where I couldn't see it.  I was getting Vanya's shoes on, and he pointed to the booger and asked what it was.

I looked down, picked it off the fabric, and identified it as a booger.

And then, because I'm lazy and didn't want to stand up to go throw it away, I offered it to Lily.

She gave it a quick sniff, then decided "Yes, thank you, I would like to eat that."

Vanya's face scrunched up in look of horrid disgust.  It's an expression that I don't think I've seen on him before.

"Her wants to <i>eat</i> that?"

"I guess so.  Dogs are gross."
