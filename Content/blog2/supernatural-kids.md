Hereâ€™s a weird one.

I was on a long car trip with my family.  We saw a highway sign advertising a tourist attraction called â€œSupernatural Kids.â€�  Intrigued to see kids levitating old phone books or conversing with the dead, we got off of the interstate and drove some distance into the country.

When we got there, what we found instead were â€œSuper-natural kids.â€�  In other words, they were just kids who were really into nature.  We had gone way out of our way to see some dirty children in bare feet and hemp clothing playing with sticks and rocks.

Thatâ€™s the sort of thing that I dream at night.
