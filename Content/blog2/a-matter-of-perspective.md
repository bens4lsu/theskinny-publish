I'm not sure what made me think of it today, but several years ago, a group of us went into a rather nice restaurant.  There were probably 6 or 8 of us.

Whoever hit the lobby first asked, "Can you seat a party of eight?"

The hostess replied, "You're in luck.  We just had a party of eight cancel their reservation."

One of our group observed, "No, <i>You're</i> in luck that we happened to show up right now."

Which was a very good point.
