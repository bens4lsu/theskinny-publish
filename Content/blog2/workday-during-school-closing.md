Baton Rouge actually closed schools today because it's really, really cold.  No snow.  No ice.  It's just butt-cold.

I believe the official statement read, "East Baton Rouge Parish Schools will be closed tomorrow due to the fact that it's supposed to be too damned cold to get out of bed."

It is cold though.  It's still in the low to mid 30's at 1:00.  It was 26 when I went out in my drawers to get the paper.  That was painful.  I won't be going outside again if I can help it.

I'm working upstairs, wearing the shirt I wore all day yesterday (and slept in last night), pajama pants, glasses, and bed-hair.  If you read this live, you can <a href="http://theskinnyonbenny.com/vidWebcam.php">spy on me</a>.

I doubt the mic on this laptop is good enough, but perhaps you can hear V in the background, talking back to the noise of Nick baby shows.

Let me know what you think of this couch with the turquoise wavy print mixed with leopard print too.
