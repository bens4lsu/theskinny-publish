The media is bound and determined to make me hate Jeremy Lin.  It's tough to do -- a great story, sure.  But I haven't even been watching 24-7 ESPN like I do during football season, and I'm tired of hearing about the guy.

Comparisons to Tim Tebow are nuts, and I think coming from the overzealous Christians looking for a hero.  Tebow was a Heisman trophy winner from a major college who was drafted in the first round.  He's actually <i>supposed</i> to be good.  Lin was undrafted and from Harvard.  No one but basketball die-hards had even heard of him 12 days ago.

Comparisons like that are what will make me hate the kid.  There are two people on earth who I would really like to see pushing daisies.  In one case, it's a personal dislike.  The other case is Tim Tebow.

A better comparison for Lin is Kurt Warner.  He went from bagging groceries to leading one of the most prolific offenses in the history of the NFL in the course of a year.

But that isn't a good comparison either.  Warner went on to put together what is probably a hall of fame career.  Lin has had six amazing games in a major media market, but that's the equivalent of about 5 minutes of a football game.

Floyd Mayweather was criticized for saying that the hype is just because Lin is ethnically Chinese.  He is definitely wrong about this -- the hype is because he outscored every other started in his first six games in the history of the NBA.  But, I have to think that his ethnicity has a lot to do with why he wasn't drafted.  I'm not going to bother looking up his stats from Harvard, but I bet they would show that this kid can play.  I know there were at least a few scouts around the league who rated him highly, only to get laughed out of the draft room.

I haven't watched the guy play.  And if all we see is highlight after highlight, I'll be rooting for the other team when I finally do catch a game.

<b>Update:</b>  Kind of cool that <a href="http://feinsteinonthebrink.com/index.php?id=2843356311304035537" target="_blank">the best sportswriter in the country came up with the same argument</a>, albeit written much better.

Feinstein really is the best.  His latest book is one of my favorite reads in years.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316079049/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=theskinnyonbe-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0316079049">You should use this link to buy it now</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=theskinnyonbe-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0316079049" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />.
