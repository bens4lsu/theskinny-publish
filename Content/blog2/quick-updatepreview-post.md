This is just a note to test whether the "Submit Post" button on my site still works.

Last night was my first night at home in almost two weeks.  I have plenty of stories and pictures from all the nights that I was out, so as soon as I can catch a little spare time, I'll have plenty to post. 

I was on a work trip that had me away Monday through Thursday last week.  Not too much to tell about that four-day stretch, but there are a couple of notes that I might mention if I work up the nerve.  On Thursday night, we went to see some 80's legends perform in a barn in rural Louisiana, and then on Friday, we had a night out in New Orleans.  Saturday morning, Mrs. theskinnyonbenny and I left for Colorado, staying in a couple different cities there.  We got back at 1:00 in the morning yesterday, and I took last night to do nothing.

(That doesn't even consider our two-week-ago experiment to see how well dog poop burns, or a sailing mishap from a month or more ago that I've been needing to describe.)

Tonight, I'm headed back to New Orleans for one of our few Hornets games this season, which leads me back to the weekend social obligations of a Holiday December.  So keep checking back -- there should be plenty of updates coming soon.
