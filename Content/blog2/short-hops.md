I'm finally to the point in the Cox customer service process where instead of calling a machine, getting frustrated, and then  eventually getting a range of hours during which the guy might show up, the guy calls me directly and asks me for a firm time that he can show up at my house at my convenience.  Don't be jealous.  You have to suffer through immensely bad service, then take time out of your day to go down and bitch before you can get to this point.

I don't know if <a href="http://theskinnyonbenny.com/dailyphoto/2009/page.php?year=2009&month=07&day=08">today's pic</a> will do it justice, but it is one of the most amazing things I've seen with my own two eyes.

All Michael Jackson, all the time coverage continues.  I noticed that the top selling songs on Itunes have been all MJ songs for two weeks now.  I bet he's making more than he has in years.  His creditors will be grateful.

Shelly wrote him <a href="/x/michaeljackson.php">an interesting obit right after the face</a>, which I've just gotten around to posting.

A wierd and fascinating dude, for sure.

I was the only one at <a href="http://collegebaseballblog.com" target="_blank">collegebaseballblog.com</a> to correctly pick LSU over Texas in 3 games.  They apparently didn't count on a Tiger win, because the prize was a DVD of the series with commentary by the Texas coach.  I told them to send it to me if he cries somewhere during the commentary, but to otherwise find a Texas fan who might want to watch it.  Nevertheless, I'm a bad-ass for winning.
