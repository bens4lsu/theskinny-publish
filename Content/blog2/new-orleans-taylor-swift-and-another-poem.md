description: We don't pass too many October without spending a week or two in New Orleans.  We welcomed our dear friend Camilla this past weekend for a long day of being tourists.  For the nightcap, Camilla and Ko went to the Taylor Swift concert in the Superdome. After picking our girl up at the airport, we dropped off gear at the house where we stayed in the Bywater.  We changed and went to brunch in Mid-City (Katie's, yum) and then spent a few hours wandering around the French Quarter.

We don't pass too many October without spending a week or two in New Orleans.  We welcomed our dear friend Camilla this past weekend for a long day of being tourists.  For the nightcap, Camilla and Ko went to the Taylor Swift concert in the Superdome.

After picking our girl up at the airport, we dropped off gear at the house where we stayed in the Bywater.  We changed and went to brunch in Mid-City (Katie's, yum) and then spent a few hours wandering around the French Quarter.

The French Quarter during Taylor Swift weekend was definitely a different vibe.  It's always a place where you see people dancing and having a good time, but it was much more bubbly this weekend.

We caught one near-brawl, when a lady passed out drunk and her date went apeshit on the restaurant staff that was trying to help her up.  That seemed more normal.

Watching the children sing Swift songs in the middle of Bourbon Street, while the street was open.

Late during our walk, we passed a team of typewriter poets, willing to write about any topic you name for tips.  I wasn't going to be the 864,541st person to give them a Taylor Swift topic, so I chose "Hippopotamus Vagina."  I dare say that our poet did a pretty good job with what he had to work with:

While we're on the topic anyway, I've decided that my euphemism for the female privates is going to be "rhymes with the capital of Saskatchewan."  As in, "Harris might lose the election next week because of something that rhymes with the capital of Saskatchewan."

Monday morning, I worked while the family slept in.  After that, we drove uptown to look at costumes and decorations and get lunch.  Standard New Orleans October stuff, but on a Monday.

Happy Halloween!
