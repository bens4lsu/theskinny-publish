I happened on this gem of a gift at a friend of mine's yesterday.  This is a wallet that someone (who I don't know) gave her as a gift.  I don't really have much to add to this.  The horrid nature of the gift speaks for itself.

I mean really, the person who thought that someone else might want this as a gift is borderline insane, if you ask me.
