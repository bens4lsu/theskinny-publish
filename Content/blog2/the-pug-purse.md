<table><tr><td>I happened on this gem of a gift at a friend of mine's yesterday.  This is a wallet that someone (who I don't know) gave her as a gift.  I don't really have much to add to this.  The horrid nature of the gift speaks for itself.<br><br>I mean really, the person who thought that someone else might want this as a gift is borderline insane, if you ask me.</td></tr><tr><td align=center><skinny:nohome><img align="center" src="/img/pugpurse.jpg"></skinny:nohome></td></tr></table>
