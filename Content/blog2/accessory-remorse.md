This Sunday, Vanya had his first violin recital.  I didn't make a video, because I thought he might look up, see the camera, and quit playing in order to stare me down.  He was nervous, and to be honest, I thought that he wouldn't play that well, but I'm happy to report that he nailed it.

I wasn't going to post about it at all, but it just dawned on me that I should have talked him into enhancing his wardrobe by one piece (although you can see that he did look great).

V has a drawer full of costumes.  Every mainstream superhero is represented, and there are a few general costume items that are unique to him.  One of those is a long black cape, with a big sequin "V" on the back.  It was a generous gift for him, painstakingly crafted from Wal Mart materials and hot glue by my mother's gay friend.

Now I'm afraid that by next year, he'll be self-conscious enough to refuse to wear it.

But how awesome would that be for him to have gone up in front of all the other parents in a cape?
