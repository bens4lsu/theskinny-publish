Last night, I was painting some crown molding in the dining room.  Even though my ceilings aren't unusually high, I've always noticed how hot it is with my head up there near the ceiling.  In no time at all, I had worked up a good sweat.

This has happened to me before.  I remember paiting the molding in my den and getting so hot that I dropped my clothes and kept painting buck naked.  I didn't do this last night for a couple of reasons.

First of all, Vanya is to the age where he thinks it's funny to be naked.  Mrs. theskinnyonbenny would sit in her chair and continue to watch TV nonplussed, but I still would have had a toddler pointing at me and shouting, "NAAAKID PAPA!"  Who needs that?

The other reason is that I was right in front of the window.  There's a coating on that window that blocks out a lot of the afternoon sun.  That's nice, but at night, it's just a huge black mirror.  And if you've ever taken a leak in a bathroom where the lady of the house put a mirror over the commode (no man would do that), you know how unpleasant it is to be stuck in one place, looking at your own ding dong.
