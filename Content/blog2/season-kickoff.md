I'm a little bit disappointed in how little football I watched last night.  After months of anticipation, we get to the first night of the season.  By the time I got everyone fed, calmed down, to bed, and went to the couch to turn on the TV, I was in time to see NC State's 4th and long attempt fail with 2 minutes in the fourth quarter.  I then got to watch South Carolina run out the clock.

No problem.  The second game of the night was Oregon at Boise State, a game that I was looking forward to if for nothing more than the chance to see the ugliest uniforms in sport playing on the ugliest field.  The last play I remember seeing:  the kickoff.

But there's much more to come.
