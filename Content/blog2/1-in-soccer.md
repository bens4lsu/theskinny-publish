This is a photo of Vanya's first minute in his first soccer game.  

His jersey is number one, which is coincidentally, his box score line.

As a matter of full disclosure, I don't know how real soccer box scores look.  Or even if they exist.  I can't think of that many stats that might apply to a game, but here's what I know:

Goals:  0
Assists:  0
Kicks:  0
Penalties:  0
# Times being within 20 yards of everyone else on the field:  0
Minutes played:  1

He stood in a corner of the field like this.  After I took the picture, I hollered for him to go kick the ball.  He slumped his shoulders, pouted, and took himself out of the game.

I hope he gets over this soccer shyness, because I really don't want to spend an hour of my springtime Saturdays watching other people's three and four year-olds having a soccer game.
