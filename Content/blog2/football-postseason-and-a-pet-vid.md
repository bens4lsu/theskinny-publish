description: It's been a long time since I just put down a full page of thoughts about football.  Well, here I do it again.  Stick to the end and there's a rewarding video that has nothing to do with football at all.

Theskinnyonbenny house has a new puppy.  Also two new kittens.  I could post pages of pics and videos, but I'm also thinking about football.

This college post season seems just a bit more nutty than most of them do.

Here at home, a group of Ole Miss coaches -- including the acting head coach -- show up at LSU and run practice for the LSU bowl game.  Meanwhile in Oxford, a group of LSU coaches heads over to Ole Miss every morning to help them prep for their game in the playoffs.

Oklahoma starts their playoff run tonight, just weeks after I had mentally added them to the list of teams searching for a new coach.  Their opponent, Alabama, might be a surprise entry on that list if Michigan makes a good enough offer.

In the BCS, the Ivy League has decided to participate in the post season tournament for the first time, which lead to Harvard getting eliminated 52 - 7 by Villanova in the first round.  Maybe there's a good reason that they haven't participated before.

The SWAC and MEAC also forgo the playoffs so that their champions can face off in the Celebration Bowl.  It's probably an important HBCU tradition, but I'd really like to see them in the playoffs too.  Imagine Yale hosting Southern.  The human jukebox alone would have New Haven buzzing for years.  If it ever happens, I'm making the trip.

Speaking of Southen football, their new coach is none other than Marshall Faulk.  He had been coaching running backs for Coach Prime in Colorado.  Colorado may not have as many wins on the field as they would have liked, but their coaching staff could have taken anyone's in a short-handled game.

Okay, just one little animal video.  And if you're watching it in current time and on a big enough screen, you probably saw it in my Bluesky feed from the home page.

I think Bellie (Belly? She hasn't told me how she spells it yet) analized how cats play and decided to try the paw swat here.  She tries it a few times and then decided, "fuck it, the bite works much better."
