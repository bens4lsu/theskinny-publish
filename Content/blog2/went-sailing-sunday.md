Tigers beat a conference team in a game that many expected them to lose.  Saints win an important game that many expected them to lose.  On Saturday, I had drinks with good friends and laughed my ass off all night.

On Sunday, we had a beautiful, beautiful sail along the South Shore of Lake Pontchartrain, with fly-by's from vintage World War II bombers and fighters.  Of all days to not bring my good camera.  This is the best I could do with my iphone, and I only got shots of one of the planes that continued to fly overhead.

There was also a regatta out there, so we had 30 or more colorful sails at various points along the horizon in front of us.

At the end of the sail, I managed to back into my slip, with a pretty mean cross-current without any major embarrassment.

It was tough to go home.

Once we were home, the Saints looked great in a win against the Packers.  I couldn't quite stay up for the whole thing, but when I woke back up in the middle of the night, highlights confirmed that the good guys held their lead.

Really good day.
