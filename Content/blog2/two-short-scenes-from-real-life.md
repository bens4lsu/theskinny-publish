Scene 1:  Master bedroom, theskinnyonbenny mansion.

<blockquote>Vanya, wearing a cowboy hat and climbing on to his mother's back:  Mama, I'm gonna ride you like a cowboy.

Mrs. theskinnyonbenny lets him climb up, smiling.

Me:  That's a much better response than I get when I tell her the same thing.</blockquote>

Scene 2:  Mexican restaurant, lunchtime on Wednesday.

<blockquote>Benny, Mrs. theskinnyonbenny, and Vanya eat their lunch.  Vanya catches the waiter's eye and waves him over to the table.

Vanya:  Hey, we don't have any money.  To pay for this.  We come back tomorrow to pay.

Waiter just gives puzzled look.

Mrs. theskinnyonbenny:  Way to go Vanya, now he's going to be watching us like a hawk.</blockquote>
