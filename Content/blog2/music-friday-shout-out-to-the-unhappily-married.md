I know an unusually large number of divorcing people right now.  We're at that age, I guess.  

Heard this one on one of the satellite radio stations this weekend.  Catchy tune, and you can say, "I knew it when."  There are only 815 views at the time that I'm posting this.

The video is very weird, by the way.
