I woke up at 3:00 this morning and never did get back to sleep.  It's now 8:30 in the evening, and I've started and deleted this entry twice before my current attempt.  I usually start writing with a half-formed idea or two, and somehow, my brain turns them into paragraphs without it seeming like an effort.<br />
<br />
Not so tonight.  So I won't try the triple lindy until later in the semester.
<!--more--><br /><br />At about 4:30 this morning, I picked up my latest issue of Sports Illustrated and went to <a href="http://www.theskinnyonbenny.com/blog/archives/00000035.php">Louie's</a>.  There were a couple of interesting facts in there that I wrote down to share with you guys.<br />
<br />
First, a quick blurb about a most unfortunate college student at some division 3 school.  It seems that he was at the wrong place at the wrong time when they decided to celebrate the win by pulling down the goal posts.  He caught a goal post in his melon, and it was curtains.<br />
<br />
I guess there are worse ways to go.  There are few things that feel as good as a huge football win for your team (although I snobbishly doubt that a win by Minnesota-Morris is as exciting as a big LSU win).  At any rate, he was at least having a really good time right there at the end.<br />
<br />
The other SI factiod that I thought was interesting is that when Jack Klugman was hired to play Oscar Madison on TV's <i>The Odd Couple</i>, the network bought all of his real clothes to be the wardrobe for Oscar.  It turns out that he is a lot like his character.<br />
<br />
I somehow suspect that Nathan Lane -- the current Oscar on Broadway could not pull any of his personal wardrobe into a suitable Oscar Madison costume.<br />
<br />
One last and completely unrelated thought:  my post on <a href="http://www.theskinnyonbenny.com/blog/archives/00000141.php">"My Old Man Holds Pencils"</a> is getting crazy traffic from search engine hits.  It seems that I'm not the only one who wondered about his Quiznos cup.  <br />
<br />
Special things to the handful of strangers who emailed me to clear up my confusion.  One message in particular amused me, and I'm unable to articulate just why this wording makes me laugh:<br />
<br />

I took a quick look around your blog, I like your entry style.  But thats not why I'm here, me and my co-worker googled the saying on the side of the Quizno's cup, and he thinks he figured it out.  The cup is saying that his old man, therefore being an older cup, holds pencils.  Retarded joke, but it makes sense.  Just thought i'd let you into "the loop".<br />

I think it's that I like how honest this reads.  Alex gives me a compliment, but barely lets me bask in it before quickly letting me know that I'm missing the point.  And then he nobly refuses to take credit for his coworker's brainchild.  Then, he concluded with his (presumably real, and not included here) phone number in his email signature.<br />
<br />
Alex: don't send your phone number to strangers on the internet.  I just finished dining on your cat, and will now be stalking your mother.  But thanks for reading!<br />
