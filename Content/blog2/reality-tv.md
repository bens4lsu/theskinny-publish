It seems like most people are either raving fans or harsh critics of reality TV.  Actually, the ratings show that there are more fans, but at least some of us reality fans aren't willing to admit it.

I have to admit that I've watched my fair share of Reality TV.  Like other programming, some of it is fantastic, and some of it is wretched.

One of my favorite aspects about reality TV is how quickly a show can go from the talk of the office to a total tank.  Everyone used to talk about the people who had to eat sheep guts on Fear Factor, but now nobody watches that show any more.  They raised the "eating gross stuff" bar as high as it would go.

I think American Idol is getting to that point.  Even when the people sing good, they choose really crappy light-rock numbers to perform.  They had a show a couple of nights ago to bring back the bad singers who got cut.  Even that one wasn't as much fun as I thought it would be.

By the way, during the early rounds, they showed about a 15-second clip of some psychopath singing in a Winnie the Pooh costume.  We never did get to see the judges reaction or hear what the guy was thinkig.  Maybe they're saving that clip for later.  I'm definitely intrigued.

Discovery Channel set up the best night in television on Mondays with Monster House and American Chopper.  They have a problem with a limited number of episodes, but heck, some of these are worth watching again.  

Fox brought Mondays one level higher with My Big Fat Obnoxious Fiance.  The jist of this one is that an actor gets to play obnoxious guy for the friends and family of his "finace."  They aren't really planning to get engaged, but their challenge is to get all of those people to believe it.  The obnoxious guy was fantastic.  My favorite part was when he told a future in law that he had just taken a "monster shit."  (That inspires me to drop that same information on my in-laws.  I'll let you all know the reaction if I really work up the nerve to do it.)

Generally, the dating shows are not very good.  Catch the last one to see attractive people look stupid, crying on TV.
