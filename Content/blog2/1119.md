Willie Lyles, Parkinson's, star receiver makes himself ineligible with some violation that we don't understand, probation because of a years-ago violation recruiting a player who LSU refused to take because of said violation, and oh yeah, I heard something about a fight at a bar.

That probably adds up to the worst August in memory, although it could be a lot worse.  Miami's bad month will plague the program for the next decade.  Our messes will be mostly forgotten in a week plus two days. 

A quick video to remind us of why we pull for the guys wearing purple and gold.

<div style="padding-top:30px;">Say what you will about his coaching, but at least Les knows how to laugh at himself.  Nick Saban would sooner light himself on fire than film a self-deprecating commercial for the Worldwide Leader.</div>
