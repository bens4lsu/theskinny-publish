As I predicted in this space on Friday morning, my bracket crashed and burned spectacularly.  I followed up my 14-2 Thursday with a 6-10 Friday, and of the 6 I picked correctly, 3 were a 1 seed beating a 16 seed.  So really, you could call my record 3-10 on games that were questionable.  It's perhaps the most unimpressive day one can have when picking basketball results.

As of now, I'm firmly lodged in second-to-last place in our pool.  But, I seem to be the only one who picked Memphis to win, so if they go all the way, I can still come home with the cash.  They have some college called Bradley up in the next round, and they have looked as strong as anyone so far.  I like their odds as much as anyone else's.

I just made the travel reservations for an upcoming work trip, and as I was doing it, I realized that I'm going to get to Indianapolis the night of the championship game.  If the one in a million scenario played out where LSU was in the game, I would be forced to spend whatever it would cost to get a ticket.  Hopefully, the matchup would end up being LSU vs. Bradley, so ticket demand wouldn't be that great.

That won't happen, but I'll at least have a chance to drive down and witness the hoopla before the game, and maybe I'll catch it at a sports bar near the stadium.  If any of you know Indianapolis at all, shoot me a pointer or two.

Things I should have done today, but couldn't because clients are in town for a meeting:

<ol><li>  Pick up replacement contact lenses.

</li><li>  Get a haircut.

</li><li>  Exercise.

</li><li>  Return the keg in the back of my Jeep.  (St. Patrick's Day.  And yes, there were a couple of splashes left, but it was pretty much drained.)

</li><li>  Buy gas.

</li><li>  Get new shoes for playing basketball.  (Right now, my ankles and knees kill me the day after we play.)

</li><li>  Figure out why my home page is displaying with big, giant fonts.

</li><li>  About a million other work related things.  (Funny how far down the list I got before this item.)

</li><li>  Clean out my shop.

</li><li>  Organize my closet.

</li><li>  Increase child literacy in my community.

</li><li>  Start a program to clean litter off of state highways.

</li><li>  Arrange a new political party so that we aren't just stuck with Democrats and Republicans when trying to pick our next president.

</li><li>  Convince Osama Bin Laden to give himself up.

</li><li>  Build a device that turns all nuclear weapons into beds of beautiful flowers.</li></ol>

But I had that meeting, so I'll have to do all of this some other time.
