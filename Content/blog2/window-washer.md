One of the hallmarks of a Louisiana summer is waking up to windows that are glazed over with condensation.

Today, Baby K noticed this phenomenon for the first time.

"Whassaaat?" he asked, pointing at the window.

"That's just water on the window."

"Mama do that.  Mama wash."

"Hahahaha.  No, Mama didn't wash anything.  It just happens by itself."

"Papa do that."

"No.  It's called condensation.  No one does it.  It just happens."

"Hola do it."  

He think's our cleaning lady is named Hola.  Much like the Bluth family thinking their youngest son is named Anyong.

"No baby.  Hola didn't do it."

"Cah-mul?"

"Who?  Oh Carmel?"

He nods.

"No, Carmel didn't come over this morning to wash our windows."

"Whassaaat?"

"Condenstation"

"Con-say-do"

"Right.  Let's go see if Mama is awake yet."
