One of the hallmarks of a Louisiana summer is waking up to windows that are glazed over with condensation.

Today, Baby K noticed this phenomenon for the first time.

â€œWhassaaat?â€� he asked, pointing at the window.

â€œThatâ€™s just water on the window.â€�
<span class="spanEndPreview">&nbsp;</span>
â€œMama do that.  Mama wash.â€�

â€œHahahaha.  No, Mama didnâ€™t wash anything.  It just happens by itself.â€�

â€œPapa do that.â€�

â€œNo.  Itâ€™s called condensation.  No one does it.  It just happens.â€�

â€œOla do it.â€�  

He thinkâ€™s our cleaning lady is named Ola.  Much like the Bluth family thinking their youngest son is named Anyong.

â€œNo baby.  Ola didnâ€™t do it.â€�

â€œCah-mul?â€�

â€œWho?  Oh Carmel?â€�

He nods.

â€œNo, Carmel didnâ€™t come over this morning to wash our windows.â€�

â€œWhassaaat?â€�

â€œCondenstationâ€�

â€œCon-say-doâ€�

â€œRight.  Letâ€™s go see if Mama is awake yet.â€�
