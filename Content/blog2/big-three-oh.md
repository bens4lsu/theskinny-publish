As of a week ago, Mrs. Theskinnyonbenny and I have been married 30 years.  How about that!

I don't feel old enough to have been married that long, and you can see that we're both way too hot to be old people just yet.

I'm sure I've written this amongst these pages before, but I have advice to those looking to ensure that their marriage is forever.  Make sure that you marry someone who prefers the flats if you prefer the drumettes, and make sure you marry a drumette person if you prefer the flats.  I refer, of course, to the thousands of orders of chicken wings in your future.

We should have thrown together a huge trip over Thanksgiving week, but we live in a money pit.  This is a celebration post, so there's no need to elaborate.

Even if it wasn't the most epic week ever, ours was a lot of fun.  We went to nice dinners in New Orleans, did family stuff for the holiday and the day after, and mixed in some Christmas prep stuff too.  V gets so excited for Christmas that it makes it even more fun for me.  He even keeps a tree up in his room year-round He's been a busy bee with the baking and decorating already.

I don't have many specific stories to break out, but I posted [a whole photo gallery](/gal/199%20-%2030th%20Anniversary%20Week/) with more captions than usual that you will want to check out.

Also, my pictures are about to get cute as hell.  Stay tuned for that.
