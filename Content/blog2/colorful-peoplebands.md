Yesterday morning, I was working on a table outside.  I looked up to see two cars in the road at a funny angle, and I thought they had been in a little fender bender.

The driver of the first car was a well dressed black lady of about 30.  The man at an angle behind her was well over 50, white, and had a loud New Orleans accent.  He surprised me by shouting joyfully, "Hey!  That's great!  Thank you ma'am!  God bless you!"

Now for two days, I can't quit trying to figure out what made him so happy.  He was holding a coffee, but they weren't coming out of a drive through, and it seems like a lot of emotion for a free coffee.  Some stranger paid for our coffee and donuts at Dunkin when I drove through before school with the kids a couple of weeks ago.  Don't get me wrong -- it is nice.  But I didn't jump out of my car to ask God to bring down blessings.

I really can't come up with anything satisfying.

No googling during the reading of this post.

A couple of weeks ago, on a long boring drive, I tried to think of band names that have a color in them.  With apologies to Jack Black, Jack White, and Pink, individual names don't count.  Here's the initial list I came up with.

<ul><li>Blue Oyster Cult</li>
<li>Deep Purple</li>
<li>The Black Keys</li>
<li>The White Stripes</li>
<li>Pink Floyd</li>
<li>Green Day</li>
<li>Black Sabbath</li>
<li>Black Kids (from whom I know one song, but it's a winner)</li></ul>

I was with some of my family the next day, and we went through my list.  While I was going through my list, my sister came up with Black Eyed Peas when I said The Black Keys.  Huge oversight by me there.

A week later, my dad texted me this list...

<ul>
<li>Blues Traveller</li>
<li>The Blue Notes</li>
<li>Ruby and the Romantics</li>
<li>Moody Blues</li>
<li>The Limeliters</li>
<li>Maroon Five</li>
<li>Redbone</li>
<li>The Slivertones</li>
<li>Quicksilver</li>
<li>Vanilla Fudge</li>
<li>Cream</li>
</ul>

I only know half of those, but I'm sure the list is legit.

I just thought of Black Flag while sitting here tying this post.

Oh! and Pearl Jam.  Pearl is a color, right?

You can play too, but you have to do it all from memory.  No cheats please!
