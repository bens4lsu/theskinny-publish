Greg Oden has issued a statement about the nude pictures of him that have been released in the public sector.

<blockquote>I want to apologize to everybody, Portland, fans, the organization. It was very embarrassing. It was something that happened over a year-and-a-half ago. It was taken and sent over a year-and-a-half ago. I'm very sorry and I'm definitely embarrassed for my family and everybody around me.</blockquote>

I'm sure it is embarrassing, but as we all know, he's got a telephone pole in his pants.  It can't be <i>that</i> embarrassing.  If any naked pics of me surfaced -- now <i>that</i> would be embarrassing.
