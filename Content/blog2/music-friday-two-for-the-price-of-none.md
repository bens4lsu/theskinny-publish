I saw this video on <a href="http://nme.com" target="_blank">NME</a>, and was then disappointed to find that Spotify had only two tracks by California X.  Amazon had just the same two, so maybe that's all they've written.  Doesn't exactly make me want to pin them as future break out monster stars, but this tune is a good one.  Reminds me of the first time I found My Chemical Romance on line.

And I have to post this clip from Mad Men, because there are those who haven't seen it yet.  It was just an absolutely perfect, genius choice for the scene.  When she started singing, I broke the reverent TV drama silence and asked Mrs. theskinnyonbenny, "Is that song for real?"  It wouldn't work today in any other context, but because it was in MM, it made it perfectly okay to enjoy here and now.  It's no coincidence that Zou Bisou Bisou trended on Twitter for the next day.
