The new season of <a href="http://www.hbo.com/sixfeetunder/about/index.shtml" target="_blank"><i>Six Feet Under</i></a> has started.  I canï¿½t help but reflect that there is no other show in television history that has so many crazy people that you actually pull for.  In fact, just about everyone has at least the occasional conversation with dead people.  On top of that, they all have their own insanities and hang-ups.  There is rarely a scene without at least a hint of someone about to go over the edge.

	<td> Previous season anger issues have pretty much gone away.  Keith is probably the least crazy of all of them.  I donï¿½t even recall a scene whereï¿½s heï¿½s interacted with dead people.  Come to think of it, what is he doing with the rest of this group?  <br /><br /></td><br />

This is the final season, and I have some hopes for how they wrap things up.  Here are some things that I hope to see:<br />
<br />
<ul><li>Some sort of knock down drag out fight between Brenda and Nateï¿½s dead wife Lisa.  If Brenda has to die to make it happen, so be it.<br /><br /></li><li>Ruthï¿½s friend Kathy Bates (whose character name I forget) shows back up and causes some chaos.  Maybe she could even run off with George after sticking around for a few episodes.<br /><br /></li><li>Rico and his wife get back together.<br /><br /></li><li>Claire gets a book deal, takes her money, and gets out of the world of dead people.<br /><br /></li><li>Keith and David live happily ever after, but they donï¿½t French kiss while on camera any more.<br />
</li></ul></td></tr></table><br />
