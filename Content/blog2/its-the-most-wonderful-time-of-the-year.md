I had just gotten into my car and shut the door, when I was siezed by a violent sneeze.  The result was a small booger on the fleshy part of my left hand.  I put down the window and gave it a flick at I started to back out of the parking space.

The booger flew as tightly and accurately as a Drew Brees spiral.  It landed smack in the middle of the windshield of the car next to me.  If I had a hand full of 2000 boogers, there's no chance I could have replicated the feat.

Do you think I got out and removed the booger from the parked car?

Not a chance.

Merry Christmas, everyone!
