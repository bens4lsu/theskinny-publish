I've been wanting to post every week lately, but truly, there's nothing I want to talk about.  Work, meals, watch football, sleep, and repeat.

Our upstairs is a disaster, with condensation damage and mold from an improperly sized and installed air conditioner, and at some point, we'll discuss that here, but definitely not now.

I checked my search history, and there's very little of interest there.  I confirmed that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Dearden" target ="_blank">actress that plays Mel</a> on The Pitt is Bryan Cranston's daughter.  I bookmarked <a href="https://www.transfinder.com/resources/The-School-Bus-to-RV-Conversion-Guide" target="_blank">a very long page of instructions for turning a school bus into a camper</a>, despite the fact that I don't own a school bus and I don't have any plans to go camping.

I saw that lots of the people who won technical Emmys that aren't broadcast <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/streaming-news/sal-saperstein-emmy-winners-the-studio-inside-joke-explained-ike-barinholtz " target="_blank">thanked the fictional Sal Sapperstien</a>.  That one made me chuckle.

V got us watching the movie <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinners_(2025_film)" target="_blank">Sinners</a> the other night.  Mrs. theskinnyonbenny bailed pretty early to watch football, and then he left with probably 45 minutes left in the movie.  But I liked it quite a bit.

I've been plowing through <a href="/books">books</a>.  The only ones I've read recently that you should too are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conclave_(novel)" target="_blank">Conclave</a> (much better than the movie was, and the movie was good), and Seth Rogan's memior Yearbook.  I listened to that as an audiobook and it made me LOL many times.

I'm loving new albums by Deep Sea Diver, Matt Beringer, Rainbow Kitten Surprise, Geese, and King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard.  Lots of animals and stupid band names in that sentence.  I would paste a playlist in here for you, but I'm afraid of what Apple will do to my music library if I tell it to sync it to its online, and I don't remember my login for Spotify.
