It's been cold for a wweek straight.  People might think that it doesn't get cold in Baton Rouge, but they are wrong.  It doesn't _stay_ cold, but it definitely _gets_ cold.  One winter, we had ice storms in consecutive weekends.  The Thursday between the two storms was in the 70s with nice sun.

This week has treated us to below freezing temperatures every morning, and if the forecast is to be believed, it's going to continue like that for a few more days.

Last week, I texted with my boy JC in Minnesota to see how the winter weather was hitting them.  Here are some highlights.

Just as a matter of comparison, here's the temperature inside one of the freezers in the garage.  Inside the freezer, I'm saying.

Minnesotans could actually go inside one of my freezers to warm up.

Now I feel dumb doing it, but I started writing this post to complain about our loss of living space.  The Regal Beagle is an important part of our home – one that we use extensively, as long as it's above 30 degrees or so.

For a whole week, it really feels like we're on top of each other.  Having the puppy and kittens who won't calm the fuck down doesn't help.  Where do you want to go in my house?  Because I bet you eight billion dollars that there's an animal in the way.

Maybe I should put on a coat and go hang out in the freezer.
