Here's my public service announcement for this week.  My recommendation for your next oil change.

I pull up toward the bay.  The guy meets me, asks what kind of oil I want, and directs me to pull in over the pit.

As soon as I stop the motor, another guy washes the windshield.  The first guy asks me what I want to drink and fixes a diet coke from a fountain between the two bays.  By now the hood is up and a team of people I can't see are at work.

The first guy takes my name, address, and vehicle information.  He runs my card, prints a receipt, and affixes the obligatory sticky piece of plastic that won't stay attached to my windshield more than a couple of weeks.

He asks me to start the car.  He has me stop the car.  The trunk closes.  He hands me my card and a receipt.

I'm back on the road in the amount of time that it took you to read this post.

No shit.

And here's a tip that I didn't know before I went:  you can print a $5 off coupon from <a href="https://www.take5.com" target="_blank">their web site.</a>

Traveling away from the place on Airline Highway, I hit some debris in the road, but for a minute, I'm sure that it was something from the bottom of my car that they forgot to re-attach.  I wait for the oil to pour out, for my engine to seize, for my vehicle to catch on fire.  But nothing happens.
