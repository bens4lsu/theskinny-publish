The day before yesterday, I got home from work, and I was feeling a little bit funk, so I decided to hop in the shower.  I went to the spare bathroom downstairs because the combination of the shower head and the water pressure is the best I know.  It reminds you of that Seinfeld episode where Kramer got a shower head that they use to hose down elephants at the circus.  I could hose down an elephant in my downstairs bathroom, and to shower under that kind of stream is nice.

I was the only one home, so I started the shower, jumped in, and was enjoying it quite a lot when I heard the smoke alarm go off.  This had happened once before.  I forgot that if you leave the bathroom door open right there, the smoke detector in the hall right oustide that bathroom detects the steam and goes off.  I shut off the alarm, closed the door, turned on the vent, and went back to my shower.

Five or ten minutes later, I was all pink and clean.  I shut off the water and started to dry off.  As soon as I heard a siren chirp, I knew what had happened.

I hurried to get dry and thow on a robe.  I got to the front door just as three firemen were walking up.  Claycut was blocked by two huge firetrucks.  Several more firemen were unloading gear behind them.

The alarm company had probably tried to phone, but I didn't hear through the roaring waterfall and closed door.  They also failed to reach Mrs. theskinnyonbenny at work or by cell -- not that she would have known what was happening either.  So they did what they should have done -- call out the fire department.

I'm glad to know that they respond so quickly.
