One of the kids' schools is in the back of a neighborhood where the streets are named for tennis stars of yesteryear.

Yesterday, I took a slight detour to avoid a garbage-truck-related slowdown, and I noticed the biggest city planning failure in the history of Baton Rouge.

Real quickly, in case you aren't a student of the game, Margaret Smith was a star from the era when black and white was giving way to technicolor.  Whe was the Serena of her day, &lt;&lt;does wikipedia search&gt;&gt; winning 24 Grand Slam events.

If it seems like you should have heard of her, you might know her by her married name, Margaret Court.

Now look again at that street name.

How did they go with Margaret Smith Circle instead of Margaret Smith Court?
