description: Some folks have been wondering how the new boat did during her first New Orleans hurricane.  Short answer:  just fine.  She looks exactly like I left her before the storm.  But storm-time New Orleans lakefront is interesting enough.  Here's a story in pictures.  And one little video at the end.
