I went to Lowes tonight to pick up a couple of one by fours and some medium sized wood screws.  I was hopping into my Jeep when the parking lot beggar hurried up and made his pitch.<br />
<br />
I've been begged by this guy before.  He's usually after fifty cents or a couple of bucks.  Fairly friendly.  I wonder why I can remember people who beg from me three times in a year, but I can't remember to take out the garbage on Thursdays.  Tonight, he wanted a ride to Tom drive.  It was real close, so what the heck.
<!--more--><br /><br />He started his hard luck story:  mother just died, car broke down, no one he can call, etc., etc.  He needed nine dollars to get a part for his car.  I noticed that he didn't smell like a beggar.  I actually detected a faint scent of soap.  Both the inside of my Jeep and I smelled worse.  Weird.<br />
<br />
He dropped an ugly racial slur.  What reaction do people expect from a stranger when they do something like that?  I kept quiet, figuring that the absence of any reaction at all was probably the best way to proceed.<br />
<br />
He asked for a couple of bucks.  I told him that I didn't have any money.  I had paid for my lumber with a credit card.  This was the truth.<br />
<br />
He swore that he's an upstanding citizen and that if I would drive through the ATM and get out $10, he would find me and pay it back.<br />
<br />
Before we get to my response, imagine how I explain that to Mrs. theskinnyonbenny:  "Sweetie, I know you put us on a budget, but I just got out ten bucks to give to a professional beggar.  I knew you would understand."  I'm not sure what the reaction would be, but it would be very, very ugly.<br />
<br />
So I lied:  "The ATM won't give me any money.  You know how it is with Christmas and all."  Or maybe that part wasn't a lie.  How the heck would I know?  I have no insight on our finances.  <br />
<br />
I did let him have the change in my ashtray.  Roughly 80 cents, I think.<br />
<br />
We went a couple of miles, staying on busy streets.  I started to get nervous.  The hard luck stories continued.  I acted like I was searching for something under the seat, just to make him think.  We sat at a red light silently.<br />
<br />
He had me drop him off at a motel a quarter mile from my office, but no longer on Tom Drive.  It's tough to keep your hard luck stories straight sometimes, I guess. I had never noticed this motel, even though it had a bright neon sign at night.  It wasn't fit for human occupancy.  Home sweet home.<br />
<br />
"Good luck buddy."<br />
<br />
"I need it," he replied.<br />
<br />
Amen to that.<br />
<br />
