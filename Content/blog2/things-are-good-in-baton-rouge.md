You know those parts in the movie <i>Airplane!</i> where Ted Striker goes into a story, and then when we return to the present tense, the person being told the story has committed suicide in a particularly painful or grotesque way?

I got to be on the receiving end of such story telling on Thursday night.  I met Heather and a coworker for a drink, and guy talked on and on and on.  It was mostly his business plans, which I really couldn't have followed had I wanted to.

At one point, Heather went to the can, and when I went back there 15 minutes later, I found her still in the ladies room, talking on the cell phone.  What a testament to the conversation back at the bar.

The worst part of it was that I was missing several games on the first day of the NCAA tournament.  You know, this really is probably the best time of year in Louisiana.  Consider all of this:

<li>  Hoops on TV.  My bracket is actually looking okay after the first full weekend of play.  I don't remember that happening before.

</li><li>  LSU baseball going on.  I haven't been to the park this year, but the team sounds fantastic on the radio.  You think LSU would give theskinnyonbenny.com a press pass to cover a game?  I think it's a worthwhile objective.

</li><li>  Streets are full of color as everything blooms.

</li><li>  The sky is actually sky blue -- not the gray of winter, or the hazy white/blue of summer.

</li><li>  Crawfish are in season.  I've had them every week for a month.  I know some of my readers are from out of town and can't appreciate what this means.  Maybe I'll write an article just about eating crawfish pretty soon.  Or maybe not.

</li><li>  Strawberries are in season too.  Love those fresh strawberries.

</li><li> I haven't had to put up the top on the Jeep in more than a week.

Why would anyone leave Louisiana now?  It's a good question, but sure enough, I am leaving for a couple of weeks.  I'm going to visit Mom and Dad in Thailand, where it is 97 degrees and 90 percent humidity every day.  White/blue hazy skies are a given.  This is their hottest time of the year, and their cool season was miserably hot when we went there 2 years ago.  

On the other hand, that trip will almost certainly provide some good stories to share on this site.  I expect to have pretty steady access to the internet, and plenty of time to spend on it.
