This is just a quick post to make sure I understand this advertisement, which I pulled out of a major national magazine this week.  (I kind of like that you can see where I dog-eard the bottom corner of the page so that I wouldn't lose it.)

If I'm not wrong, they are suggesting that when I'm on a long flight, and I start jonesing for that cigarette, that I just pull out my pack of dip.

"Oh stwardess, could I have an empty cup please?"

I get one of those clear plastic cups that prevent them from wasting a whole can of coke on a single passenger.

Then, I scoop the skoal into my pie hole, swish it around a bit, and then spit the brown smelly snotty residue into my clear plastic cup for all of the other passengers to see and smell.

Is that how it's supposed to work?

The advertisement says, "Absolutely."
