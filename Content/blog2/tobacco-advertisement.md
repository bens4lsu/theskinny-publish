	<td><br /><br />This is just a quick post to make sure I understand this advertisement, which I pulled out of a major national magazine this week.  (I kind of like that you can see where I dog-eard the bottom corner of the page so that I wouldn't lose it.)<br /><br />If I'm not wrong, they are suggesting that when I'm on a long flight, and I start jonesing for that cigarette, that I just pull out my pack of dip.<br /><br />"Oh stwardess, could I have an empty cup please?"<br /><br />I get one of those clear plastic cups that prevent them from wasting a whole can of coke on a single passenger.<br /><br />Then, I scoop the skoal into my pie hole, swish it around a bit, and then spit the brown smelly snotty residue into my clear plastic cup for all of the other passengers to see and smell.<br /><br />Is that how it's supposed to work?<br /><br />The advertisement says, "Absolutely."</td>
