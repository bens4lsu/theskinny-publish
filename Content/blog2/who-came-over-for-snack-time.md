This morning, I was waiting for Vanya to come get in the bathtub while he made a morning poo.  When he got up from the toilet, he observed that it had come out green.

He asked if I could see it, and I replied that I couldn't.  So he wiped, and held up the tissue for my inspection.  Sure enough, it was a pretty bright green streak.

I tried to hurry him to the bathtub, but he wanted to speculate on what might be happening in his intestines.

"When I was outside, I ate crackers with leprechauns."

I have no idea where that explanation came from, but I'm still laughing at the thought, and a little proud that he thought through such a plausible hypothesis.
