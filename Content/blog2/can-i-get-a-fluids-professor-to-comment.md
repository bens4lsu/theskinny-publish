Yesterday, some miraculous combination of hydrodynamic forces combined in just the right way so that when I flushed the toilet, and the water was about to go down, a teaspoon full flew out and hit me in the shirt.

That's all there is to this story, but in my 38 years of using toilets I've never seen such a thing, so I thought I would record this event for posterity.
