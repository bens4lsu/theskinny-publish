If you have a three year old, you can make some extra money by getting a part time job naming drugs for pharmicutical companies.  And it couldn't be easier.  Just combine the name of cartoon characters on any two of your household televisions.

Right now, we have Wubzy on in the bedroom and Peter Pan going unwatched in the den.  Wubzipan.

In the morning, Mickey Mouse competes with Sid the Science Kid.  Mickisid.  Maybe not on that one.  Plutosikid?  That works better.

See, it's easy.
