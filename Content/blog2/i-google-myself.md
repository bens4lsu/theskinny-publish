I Google myself from time to time, just to see what other yahoos with my name are out there doing.  Believe me, there are some people putting up much more embarassing stuff than I am.

I'm way down the page on <a href="http://www.ladytexian.com/txrusk/news/news1886.htm" target="_blank">this page</a>, but it's one I look for every time I look through the results.  The relevant text is this:

<blockquote>February 17, 1886

D: Cleaburne, Tx, - Feb. 10th, Ben Schultz who was shot by Bonnard the other day in fight over a pair of old spurs, died tonight (p.2, c.2)
</blockquote>

Damn that Bonnard!
