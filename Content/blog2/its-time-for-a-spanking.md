Here's an interesting question for the married men readers to consider.  This came up in a conversation at work about a year ago.  I can't remember how it worked its way into the conversation, but whenever I think of it, I can't help but laugh.  It goes without saying that this is strictly hypothetical:

Consider how you would approach you wife and request a spanking -- yes a spanking, and do it with a striaght face.

I can tell you right now that there's no way in the world that I could do it without laughing.  I mean, why on earth would you want a spanking from your wife?  There's just nothing sexy or cool about being smacked on the ass.

But pretending that I could pull it off, it would go something like this:

Me:  Um, sweetie.... I was thinking... I think it might be really swell if you would...um...if you would...well, if you would drop my drawers and give me a spanking.

Heather:  You <i>what</i>?

Me:  Seriously.  It would be cool.

Heather:  No, I wasn't listening.  What did you say?

I stammer out the request again.

Heather:  You must be out of your mind.  Where did you come up with such a thing?

Now consider the odd situation that would occur after you have been on the receiving end of a spanking.  You and the wife are disagreeing on some aspect of family life.  Maybe it's where to send the kids to school; maybe it's whether to vacation in Hawaii or in Vancouver.  If you just got a spanking the night before, then you instantly lose that arguement.  No questions asked.  All the wife has to say is, "Shut up.  You actually let me <i>spank </i>you last night."  How could you argue?

So let's close with a challenge:  in the next day, approach your wife, husband, boyfriend, girlfriend (or boss, stranger, friend.  Whoever) as seriously as you can, and ask for a spanking.  Let us know how it goes.  If I get any emails on this, I'll post a follow-up.
