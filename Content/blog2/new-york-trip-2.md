I donâ€™t even know how long itâ€™s been since I typed up one of these.  I have a lot of ground to cover, and a lot of ground I wonâ€™t get to, as Iâ€™m in the middle of an ultra-busy two weeks.  After next week, Iâ€™ll get back to one or two blogs a week, a regular photo of the day, and a link of the week update every week.  But for this week and next, youâ€™ll just have to settle for what I can puke out, a minute here and a minute there.

This past weekend, we went on a little excursion to New York.  We ate pretty good, drank in some cool bars, walked up and down the Avenues people watching and shopping.  Monday evening, we met several other people at <a href="http://www.flatironlounge.com" target="_blank">Flatiron Lounge</a>.

Flatiron is the bar of a famous bartender.  Perhaps you didn't know that there are famous bartenders, but Mrs. theskinnyonbenny can find another extreme coctail-phile and drop names back and forth like you and I might be able to do with N.F.L. quarterbacks.  It's an odd celebrity group to know, but on the upside, I go to big cities, take a cab across town, and pour exotic drinks in my mouth that taste like the gods' elixers and pack a most pleasant punch.

Anyway, their snack mix included some kind of nut that had been smoked.  So toward the end of our stay, I said with much enthusiasm, "I should smoke me some nuts.  That would be gooood."

And then, realizing what I said, I laughed at myself for a half hour straight.

Later, we were waiting for Madonna to start her show at Madison Square Garden, Shelly borrowed my cell phone, and texted everyone we know in common the message, "Will you smoke my nuts?"

A sampling of replies...

Tyler:  Sure, if you get me a new job.

Sharples:  If you get me drunk first, you betcha!

Craig:  I'm not sure if that's supposed to go to me?

Clay didn't respond, so Shelly sent one more to him:  Shelly's titties are looking really hot and juicy tonight....

Sounds more like a roast beef po-boy than how I would describe titties, but maybe she was hungry.

Anyway, if you got a wierd text from me on Monday night, that's what was going on.

The show was really good.  It was half-circus, half-concert.  I've described Madonna in concert before, so there's no reason to go back through it. 

In looking for other good reasons to make fun of me, I had one of the most boneheaded gambling episodes in history this weekend.  We do this pool where you have to pick one college football underdog to win outright every weekend.  If your pick does pull the upset, you get the number of points by which the other team was favored.  I've been doing this for a few years, and for the first time in the history of the pool, someone (I) picked a favorite.  As if all of a sudden I don't even understand the game we're playing.

It bought me no points, but I was the only one to pick a correct winner last weekend.

I took <a onclick="window.open('/pg3.php?spgmGal=048%20-%20New%20York%20October%202008','048NewYorkOctober2008','width=1024, height=768, toolbar=no, location = no, directories=no, menubar=no, resizable=yes, scrollbars=no');"  >a few pics</a> up there for you to check out too, and I had an <a href="overheardinnewyork.com" target="_blank">Overheard in New York</a> moment too, which I'll leave for another day.
