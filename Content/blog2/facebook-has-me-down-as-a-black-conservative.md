If you dig down into your Facebook settings, you can see the categories that they put you in for the sake of pimping you out to advertisers.  I checked mine this morning.
<span class="spanEndPreview">&nbsp;</span>
<a class="lightview centered" href="/img/fbAdGroups.png" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="/img/fbAdGroups.png" alt="/img/fbAdGroups.png" width="650px"><br><span class="caption"></span></a>

I'm not impressed.

The things they're right about are things I've told them directly:  the month of my birthday, that I live with my family.

But on the things they derived, they're not too swift.  For example, how am I a "new" smartphone and tablet user if I also own an iPhone 6?

To Facebook I'm, "Away from hometown," when I literally live on the same street, two miles down from the building where I was born.  And although there are a few other towns that will always feel like home too, I've never lived anywhere other than my current house in my entire adult life.

Even more interestingly, I'm both a political conservative and an African American.  I truly can't imagine what I've visited that let them categorize me into either of these groups, but I'm happy that Facebook obviously thinks I'm cooler than I actually am.  

Hat tip to the always-entertaining Reply All podcast, who <a href="https://gimletmedia.com/episode/109-facebook-spying/" target="_blank">looked into how Facebook is spying on you this week</a>.
