It's been a while since this happened, so I might have told this on the blog already.  I know my friends and family have already heard it more than once, so apologies all around for the repitition.

I was walking the dog (or maybe dogs, I'm not sure) between 9 and 10 one night.  We were in the garden district over near LSU.  We're walking on the sidewalk along Dalrymple/Park (a main boulevard lined by residences on each side) when an SUV across the lane, across the median, and in the far lane stopped.  The window came down, and a young dude shouted across to me.

"HEY!  WHERE CAN WE FIND SOME PROSTITUES AROUND HERE!"

I was struck dumb for a few seconds, both because of the surprise of the situation, and because I honestly couldn't think of where one might go in Baton Rouge to find a prostitute.  I finally managed to spit out a weak, "ummm, I don't know."

"COME ON!  THERE'S GOT TO BE SOME PROSTITUES AROUND HERE SOMEWHERE."

"Well.  I'm sure there are.  I just don't know where to find them."

"SHOULD WE TURN OR GO STRAIGHT?"

"Keep going straight."

Off they drove.

It bothered me that I couldn't be more helpful to obvious visitors to my community, and as I walked back to the house, I started to think of lots of places they might have gone:  strip clubs, Plank Road, Escorts in the Yellow Pages.  So next time I get that question, I'll be much more prepared.
