Some comedy troupe has surly filmed this exact scene, right?
<div style="margin-left: 2em;">

First Bishop of Rome: We shall henceforth commemorate the day that our savior was crucified on the cross!

Spirit of Jesus: Awww, that's nice.

Bishop: We will call that day "Good Friday!"

Jesus: WTF

</div>
<span class="spanEndPreview">&nbsp;</span>
<a class="lightview alignright" href="/img/vanya_porkfest.jpg" data-lightview-caption="An unrelated, although recent, picture of V." data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="/img/vanya_porkfest.jpg" alt="/img/vanya_porkfest.jpg" width="350px"><br><span class="caption alignleft">An unrelated, although recent, picture of V.</span></a>

Speaking of things we all know and never say, V and I were idly watching the cat lick his balls the other day.
<div style="margin-left: 2em;">

V: What's he doing?

Me: Taking a bath.

V: But that doesn't get him clean. He's just getting spit all over his balls.

Me: ...

Me: I can't argue with you there.
