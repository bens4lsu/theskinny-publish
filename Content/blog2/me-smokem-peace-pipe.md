I recently related a story to my wife and mother.  I would have thought that between them, there were no tales that they had not heard, but they both claimed that it was new to them.  I guess that makes it a fresh story for me to post here.

I was a kid of no more than 7 or 8.  Our family was on vacation, and we went into a tourist trap souvinier store.  I was drawn to a toy tobacco pipe -- I think it was decorated like someone pictured an Indian peace pipe.

I stuck it in my mouth and took a look at the mirror.  Just then, I noticed an even better feature.

"Hey! They made the mouth part of this chocolate flavored!"

The lady working the store overheard me and answered snottily.

"Actually, the boy who had it in his mouth before you was eating chocolate ice cream."

Uuugh.
