There are only a couple of bad things about the death of albums.  First is the end of giant album cover art.  Who even notices album art any more?  On new albums, they're just mailing it in.

The other thing we miss is the ability to look at our album jacket or even our cassette sleeve for the lyrics.  I know all of the words to the songs I listened to in the 80s.  But not any more.   Very occasionally, I've been interested enough to go look up the lyrics, and then copy and paste them into Itunes.  But that's a lot of work.

I found a solution to this issue.  <a href="http://www.download.com/Lyricsnapper/3000-2169_4-10661126.html" target="_blank">Lyricsnapper sits on your desktop as you play songs in Itunes, and as you listen, it looks up the lyrics, displays them on the screen, and updates the track, so that you've got them in perpetuity.

Now here's the drawback:  it's not all that stable.  But normally, when it crashes, your computer forges along without any more trouble, so I still think it's worth the download.
