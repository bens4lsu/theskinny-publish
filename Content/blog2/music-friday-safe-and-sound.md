There must have been some top-tier procrastination going on at my desk this week.  Because I've never once before heard a Taylor Swift song (although I know the name), and there's exactly a zero percent chance that I will see <i>Hunger Games</i>.  But somehow, I found this video, and I like it.

After listening to this, I used google to find other Swift videos, and I see why they haven't been on my radar.  The nice way to say it is that her music isn't my cup of tea.
