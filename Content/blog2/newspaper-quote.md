I've seen a zillion pooly-worded stories in Baton Rouge's paper, *The Advocate*, but this senence from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080925165742/http://www.2theadvocate.com/sports/saints/26372754.html" target="_blank">here</a> is probably the worst I've read.

<blockquote>Payton said he will carry a play list to the one he uses for a regular-season game, but the list will be cut back and reduced the formations.</blockquote>

I know I'm not one who should talk, but I just type this stuff in a flow of conciousness.  I don't have anyone being paid to be an editor.
