My kid is really growing up.  So far, he's had difficulty with V's, so he pronounced his name "NaaNaa."  Yesterday, he got the V in the mix:  "VVVVVnaanaa."

The past two weeks or so, he can't get enough of the movie <i>Toy Story</i>, which up until then, I hadn't seen since it was first released.  He relates to Woody the Cowboy, as they both enjoy wearing boots.  We tried <i>Cars</i> and the one with the rat who like to cook, but they can't even approach the popularity of "Cowboy."

This show has run so often that when I pulled a pen out of my bag and it looked like this, my first thought was that it was one of those toys that is disassembled and pieced back together with non-matching parts of other toys by the bad kid in that movie.

Even though I'm tired of it, I will admit that I had forgotten how clever it was.  The toy soldiers on their reconnaissance missions were the best.
