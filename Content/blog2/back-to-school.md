Although it seems early as hell, the school year is a couple of weeks old.  Along with that, school traffic is a couple of weeks in.  It's always especially bad at the beginning of the year.  I blame the elementary school families, who don't have the routine down and show up at carpool drop off with their kids still in socks, cramming that last bite of toast down their throats as the teachers open the back doors of their giant SUVs.

Last Friday, we got the traffic trifecta.

Traffic trifecta is  much better word for it.  I wish I had thought of that when I made the Bluesky post.
