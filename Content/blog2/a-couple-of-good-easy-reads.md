If <a href="https://www.outsideonline.com/adventure-travel/essays/me-myself-and-ribeye/" target="_blank"> this article</a> doesn't make you hungry, then there's something wrong with you.

I particularly like this passage.

<blockquote>There was a steak vendor across the street from the airport, working off a trailer-mounted grill. I ordered a steak from him, and he pulled the thin and strange-looking meat from a plastic shopping bag that was lying near the wheel well.

"Please tell me you're not going to eat that," said Katie.

I try not to talk with my mouth full, so I was unable to reply.</blockquote>

A quick book recommendation:

It's a grim piece of work -- journals of a pretty desperite drug addict during the recording of and tour for the Girls Girls Girls album.  There are comments from participants made from present-day, and unless you've lived among drug addicts, it's as fascinating and blunt a picture as could be painted.
