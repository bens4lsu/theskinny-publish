It's a grim piece of work -- journals of a pretty desperite drug addict during the recording of and tour for the Girls Girls Girls album.  There are comments from participants made from present-day, and unless you've lived among drug addicts, it's as fascinating and blunt a picture as could be painted.</td></tr></table>
