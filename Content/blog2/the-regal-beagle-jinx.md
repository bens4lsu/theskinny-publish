College baseball for LSU finished up yesterday, ending college sports for the year (sorry Track and Field -- I just don't care), and starting the long, hot countdown to football season.<br />
<br />
Hopefully, the end of the school year takes with it the Regal Beagle LSU Jinx.<br />

<!--more--><br /><br />If you aren't up to speed, last summer, we built an outdoor grill and patio with a cement bar and some aluminum bar stools.  Its rigged with some rudimentary luxuries like fans and a built in beer cooler.  One of the last additions was a TV, mounted up high.  It is the perfect place to watch a game.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, LSU is oh-for when someone watches them play out there.  And unlike the good luck talisman (my old hat), it seems to apply across sports.  A quick rundown:<br />
<br />
<ul><li>Football:  LSU gets clobbered by Georgia for their first loss of the season.</li><li>Football:  LSU loses a close game against Auburn that they should have won.  I go outside to watch the end of the game at the beagle, costing LSU the win.</li><li>Football:  After avioding watching the tigers outside for the rest of the season, my Mom turns on the Citrus Bowl out there on New Years day.  New Years day is often a rough one for me, and I had to take a nap at halftime.  I intended to get up and shoo her out of there once the game started, but I only woke up in time to see LSU lose the game on the last play.</li><li>Basketball:  I watched one regular season basketball loss out there all by myself.</li><li>Basketball:  A yard full of people were there for a crawfish boil as LSU got eliminated from the SEC tournament in a good game.</li><li>Women's basketball:  I went home at lunch and watched LSU give up a huge lead to Alabama during the SEC tournament.  Went back to work, and LSU pulled ahead and won.</li><li>Baseball:  Rice beats LSU Saturday night while we cooked out.</li></ul><br />
<br />
I'm not slanting the story, either.  I have never watched the Tigers win anything from my back yard.<br />
<br />
Summer is always rough as far as sports to watch.  I can't seem to get interested in car races.  I can nap to golf tournaments, but don't really want to watch one hour after hour.  Major League Baseball is a snooze, and I don't have a team to pull for in those meaningless regular season games anyway.  If Miami and Phoenix had made the NBA finals, I would watch those games, but for San Antonio and Detriot, I'll take the highlights only, please.<br />
<br />
That leaves me with Wimbledon and the Tour de France as the only events where I have a passing interest.<br />
<br />
It's going to be a long, hot summer.
