The worst part about starting a new work project is getting familiar with a new office culture.  Itâ€™s all over the map â€“ from the quiet, dress-shirt wearing professional building to the noisy, jeans and t-shirt wearing software shops.  This month, I started a new thing at one of the quiet, professional type places.

<table cellpadding="2" align="right"><tr><td width="5" rowspan="2"><spacer type="block" width="5" height="1"></td><td width="250" ><img src="/img/doorwindow.jpg"></td></tr><tr><td class="caption" width="250">The door-window.  I didn't have the nerve to take the picture from an angle where the woman who sits through there can see me.</td></tr></table>

The building is a typical office building, with an elevator lobby that has doors to two or three different companies.  The restrooms are also from a door in the lobby, and on my floor, the menâ€™s room is a nightmare.  There are two stalls and a urinal, crammed together along one wall.  One is a handicap stall, but the other is tight enough to bump each elbow on each side.  If I were 25 lbs heavier, I wouldnâ€™t be able to fit back there to the urinal at all.

What makes it all the worse is that these three holes serve a whole office floor of men.  At first, I was never, never, never alone in there.  Iâ€™m hearing other people make the worst sounds in the world just inches away from me, while they hear me do the same.

Then,  I discovered that the floor above mine is much more scarcely populated.  Itâ€™s been recently renovated.  There are still paint patches on the walls, and the air still smells like new carpet.  Best of all, the menâ€™s room was always empty.

Itâ€™s true that everything is a tradeoff.  I found my empty menâ€™s room, but at the cost of having the lady behind this door give me the stink-eye every day.  I appear in her window from her right â€“ where the only door is the one to the stairwell, and then she sees me walk away from her and into the menâ€™s room.  Then, weâ€™re face-to-face through her door window as I walk back.  

Her expression is always far from friendly.

Yesterday, as I was coming out, in came the guy who sits at the desk next to me one floor below.  His face (and Iâ€™m sure mine too) was priceless â€“ the shock of being discovered dashing in for an illicit poo.
