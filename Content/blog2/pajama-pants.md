For a couple of weeks now, I have failed to mention my fight with a four year old over pajama-bottoms.  No one has ever accused me of being the most mature grown-up in the crowd, but I proved over the Labor Day weekend that I can be as childish as, well, as a real child.

I don't guess it matters how we got into the situation, but Jake needed some clean pajama pants, and I was the one dispatched to get them.
<span class="spanEndPreview">&nbsp;</span><br /><br />Annika went up to his room with me, purportedly to help me find the pajamas, but in her own mind, her mission was more sinister.  She had a very deep, primal, inner need to keep her brother from putting on clean pajamas.

First, she tried to distract me.  She wanted to show me something in her room.  I wouldn't bite.

Then, she tried to show me that the pajamas were in Jake's closet.  I suppose she thought I would see just normal clothes, and then give up on finding pajamas.  I went to the closet, but caught on quickly that I was being duped.  I mean really, who keeps pajamas in the closet?

At this point, I wised up to the fact that I was dealing with an opponent rather than with an assistant.  Annika sensed that I was now in combat mode, and went up another notch.

Simultaneously, I found pajama pants in a drawer, and the battle was on.

"YOU CAN'T BRING THOSE DOWN"

Why not?

"HE CAN'T WEAR THOSE NOW"

Out of my way, little girl.  I have pajama pants to carry down the stairs.

"BUT IT'S A WASTE OF LAUNDRY."

Huh?  (That one stopped me for a second, as I tried to comprehend.)

"IT'S A WASTE OF LAUNDRY!!!"

I still didn't (and don't to this day) really understand that argument, but this was the point where I bent over and stuck an index finger right in the poor little girl's face.  "Do <i>you</i> do the laundry around here?"  I went on, without waiting for the response.  I was talking fast and loud by now.

"I know you don't, and I think that whoever does do the laundry wouldn't mind Jake wearing clean pajama pants."

With that, I took them down and put them on the kid.

And then, I sat there and gloated.  I think I stopped short of actually making eye contact and then sticking out my tongue at Annika, but I sure did want to.  She continued to whine about her brother's pants for a while, which made my inward gloating all the worse.  (I know... I fear that I might be evil.)

If you're too worried, don't be.  As soon as Annika was inclined to be noisy and disruptive again, we made friends in a hurry.
