You can read the boxscore for yourself, and you've seen about the TV ratings already.  Here are some stats that you'll only see on theskinny.

<table style="border:1px solid gray;">

<tr><td>4</td><td>God's ranking in Louisiana Facebook "likes," behind New Orleans Saints, Black and Gold, and Drew Brees.</td></tr>

<tr><td>5</td><td>God's ranking in New Orleans Facebook "likes."  Shockey comes out of nowhere to leapfrog the almighty in the metro area.</td></tr>

<tr><td>96.7</td><td>Drew Brees completion percentage after the first quarter Sunday, if you throw out the one that Coleston dropped and a spike to stop the clock at the end of the first half.  (He was 29 of 32, I think I read.)</td></tr>

<tr><td>1</td><td>Number of people that I've ever heard of who had slept with the Lombardi trophy in bed with them.</td></tr>

<tr><td>1</td><td>Number of people in my house who like to sleep with their favorite toy.  (Two if you count me falling asleep with my ipod playing.)</td></tr>

<tr><td>1</td><td>Number of coaches (Peyton again) who've invited their players' kids to come run around on the field during the final pregame walthrough, so it could be a big event for the whole families.</td></tr>

<tr><td>9.5</td><td>Rating, on a 1-10 scale, of Drew Brees wife.</td></tr>

<tr><td>6.25</td><td>Rating, on a 1-10 scale, of the wife Brees would be able to pull were he to be a normal desk job kind of guy.</td></tr>

<tr><td>0</td><td>Number of parades I've listened to on the radio, prior to yesterday.</td></tr>

<tr><td>12</td><td>Approximate number of gigabytes that a TIVO'd Superbowl in high-def takes up in disc space.</td></tr>

<tr><td>13</td><td>Days that it will take Carbonite to back up the game once I get the file transferred to my computer.</td></tr>

<tr><td>6</td><td>Maximum number of hours I've slept in any given night since the game.  Yesterday, I was up at 3:30 to watch highlights.  Today, I woke up at 4:00.</td></tr>

<tr><td>0</td><td>Number of Superbowl commercials that I've seen.  I'm feeling a little bit inadequate in my ability to be socially conversant, but sooner or later, I'll watch that Tivo recording of the broadcast.</td></tr>

We had a great night out on Bourbon Street.  I haven't worked up the nerve to check the pics and video that I took, but I'll post some of that stuff by the end of the week.
