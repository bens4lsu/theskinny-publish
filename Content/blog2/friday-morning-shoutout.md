This one's for you, <a href="http://tylerdrew.us" target="_blank">Tyler Cummings</a>.

Side note:  I lived in Connecticut (State motto:  Impossible for even former residents to spell our name without spell check) my last two years in high school.  Unfortunately, I missed out on all of the sex that is apparently going on up that way.  But Connecticut of the late 80's was a place of girls in bulky sweaters, and if any leg was showing at all, it was masked by long-underwear pants.  So it might have been harder to work up a good, old fashioned case of being horny back then.

I take it that this isn't the official video for the song, but the little pictures do add to the experience.  The nutmeg really made me chuckle, for some reason.
