I had a most unimpressive conversation with a campaign worker for David Vitter last night.  Vitter is running for a soon to be vacated U.S. Senate seat for Louisiana.  She started by asking if I was "Mister McClood."  (She was working on an old telemarketing list.  Mrs. theskinnyonbenny's maiden name is McLeod, but it was even mispronounced.  Not to mention that there never was a "Mr. McLeod" at our phone number.)<br />

<!--more--><br /><br />I told her that there was nobody by that name here and started to hang up when she asked if I was a registered voter.  I told her I was, and she went into a really bad read of some prepared campaign text.  Honestly, it sounded like a third grader stumbling through the words.  And heck, third graders don't get to rehearse.  She had probably read the same text dozens of times already.  It only lasted a minute or so, and she asked if Mr. Vitter could count on my vote.  I told her that I hadn't done my homework on the Senate candidates yet and asked why she thought he deserved my vote.<br />
<br />
Her response:  "David Vitter is for the war on terror."<br />
<br />
So I was to presume that his opponents are all for making things good for terrorists?  Of course not.  So I replied, "well yeah, I'm sure all of the candidates are against terrorism.  Tell me what sets Vitter apart."<br />

<br />
She asked me what issue was important to me.  This was clearly her highlight -- a really intelligent response, and not rehearsed in any way.<br />
<br />
I asked this totally unanswerable, loaded question:  "What does he suggest we do in order to get our troops out of Iraq, and leave a peaceful country in our wake?"  Again, there is no answer to this question.  Anyone who tells you that there is a way to get out soon and leave peace is a bumblehead.<br />
<br />
She didn't call me on my loaded question, but she didn't answer my question either.  I got, "He agrees with Mr. Bush."  She then invited me to call an 800 number or visit the <a href="http://davidvitter.com/" class="mainbox" frame="_blank">David Vitter web site.</a>  <br />

(To be fair, here are links for the other candidates that stand a chance in November.<br />

Arthur Morrell - I can't find an official site for his campaign.  Let me know if you know of one.<br />
<br />
And one more site, just for fun...<a href="http://politicsla.com/" class="mainbox" frame="_blank">politicsla.com</a>)<br />
<br />
Anyway, I think we both left the conversation feeling like we had done a little good.  I certainly enjoyed the conversation.
