I don't usually enjoy end-of-year retrospectives, but I very much enjoyed <a href="http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2007/writers/austin_murphy/12/11/season.review/2.html" target="_blank">this college football season review</a> from Austin Murphy on si.com.  I pulled a quote from the article to add to my quote file.

<blockquote>If they win this game, that sumbitch bitch should win the Heisman!</blockquote>

-- James Carville, regarding Tim Tebow during the LSU/Florida game.

Practice saying "Sumbitch bitch" in your best imitation of Carville's voice.  This just breaks me up.

As an outspoken proponent of both LSU and the state of Louisiana, I always find Carville to be equal parts embarassing and entertaining.

The night before last, I was asleep, and woke to Lily giving quiet little barks.  Usually, this means she wants me to scoot over a foot or so, so that she can jump into bed.  I slid over and closed my eyes, but she continued to whisper bark.

I finally woke up enough to look down.  When she saw my eyes open, she took a few steps toward the door, and looked back.  I closed my eyes.  She whisper barked again.

I tried to reach, but she kept moving toward the door a few steps and looking back.  She was asking me to follow her.

Having never pulled the Lassie behavior before, I was curious.  What sort of danger could she be bringing me to?  I followed her into the den, where she jumped up on the couch with Blossom.  Blossom looked up and wagged her tail a little.  Lily rested her had on the bigger dog's rump.

I'm not sure why Lily wanted me to come out there with her.  Perhaps it was her version of a fire drill, and she just wanted to see if she could get me moving in case there was an actual emergency.  I'm not sure, but she definitely asked me to follow her out for some reason.

I layed down on the couch with the two dogs and fell back asleep.  When I woke up hours later, I had the couch to myself.
