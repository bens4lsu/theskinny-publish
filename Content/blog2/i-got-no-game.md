If you've been reading between the lines, you've figured out that I spend most of my work days at either a fancy new state office building, or at a filthy local building that's occupied by one of the state's contractors.  I've been working with this contractor since August without ever once mentioning to anyone at either place that my friend Amanda is an employee of theirs.

Yesterday, for the first time, I went on a little tour of the building where Amanda works.  A short way into the tour, it occurred to me that Amanda is far more attractive than anyone else I had seen in the building, and I got this notion to make it look like I got game.

I figured that I could catch her eye, do something slighltly flirtatious, and then Amanda wouldn't be able to help but laugh a little.  Not knowing that she knew me, all of the other people on the tour would just think I pulled off a succesful cross-room move on her.

The second I hatched this little plan, I stepped forward and saw Amanda's back staring into her computer screen.  Apparently accustomed to a tour group of useless people moving through, she didn't turn around at all.  I thought that would be fine; on the way back, we would be approaching toward her face, and I thought I could pull it off then.

But coming back, she was on the phone, and looking away from the aisle.  I don't think she ever knew I was there.

I'm still not going to mention that I know someone in that building.  Some time in the next several weeks all of us from the various locations are supposed to move there, although for the life of me, I don't know where we'll cram everyone.  I have to figure out what flirt to do.  I've never been much of a winker.  A smile/nod is too subtle.  How about some suggestions from someone who really would know how to pull this off with a stranger?
