While we were sailing, we were also schooling.  One of the things we did with Kolya is poetry.  And of course, poetry starts with Haiku.

Theskinnyonbenny has always been a big proponent of haiku.  Back in the early days of the site, my man Tyler sent <a href="/haikus/">hilarious haikus</a> to me from time to time.  Some of them even hold up today.

Those haikus even <a href="/blog2/mailbag-v/">inspired others</a>.  I wish I had kept calling for more, because it's the height of amusement.

Here are some of Kolya's compositions.  Most of these while we were crossing the pond.  I can tell by, "We do not have food."  We had food.  But we did run out of junk.  Lest you think the young ones were the only ones who suffered, we also ran out of beer while crossing.

I had some of these in my text messages, and I used the search to find them.  I also found this conversation from a 14 years ago.  Maybe I posted it back then.  Who can say?

I encourage anyone who stumbled onto this post to write a haiku and send it to me.  You probably know me in real life, but if not, my DMs are open on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/bens4lsu.bsky.social" target="_blank">bluesky</a> at the moment.
