The novelty of me shaving my head has finally worn off.  My hair actually grows back quite quickly.  It's hard to keep a good Charlie Brown look going.  As you might imagine, showing up after lunch with your mane lopped off leads to some good reactions.  I wish I had thought to set up the video camera to catch the expressions of passes by.

When you show up with no hair, everyone's a comedian.  Some questions are good, and some are bad.  The comparisons to other bald people are mostly pretty good.  (More on that in a day or two.  Look for a new page.)

Here are the questions that I'm asked most commonly.
<a class="lightview alignright" href="/img/benbald.jpg" data-lightview-caption="That there's one ugly son of a gun." data-lightview-group="group1" style="width:350px;"><img src="/img/benbald.jpg" alt="/img/benbald.jpg"><br><span class="caption">That there's one ugly son of a gun.</span></a>

<ol><b><li />Why did you do that ?</b>
<br><br>
I know that what you really mean is that I look a lot uglier now.  Yes, I was really good looking with a full head of hair, but heck, there's no harm in letting some of the other guys get some attention once in a while.  
<br><br>
What I get in the trade off for my good looks is air conditioning.  My head was hot.  Damned hot.  Miserable hot.  A walk outside for an hour felt like an all day trek through Mexico.  Just sitting inside in the air conditioning was hot.  It was awful.
<br><br>
One more thing:  I'm not the one that has to see my ugly cranium.  I catch a mirror only a couple of times a day.  It's the rest of you who notice my looks.
<br><br>
<b><li>So is it cooler now?</li></b>
<br><br>
Yes, honestly, it really is.  Not only is it cooler, it's just generally comfortable.  It's fun to rub a bald head, or to slap it a little, like Curly from the Three Stooges.
<br><br>
<b><li>Did your wife know?</li></b>
<br><br>
I've been threatening to shave my head for years.  I'm pretty sure that I was well past the point where she really thought I would do it, but then again, I don't think that it was a total shock.  She knows me pretty well.
<br><br>
<b><li>So what did she say?</li></b>
<br><br>
I remember it something like this...
<br><br>
<blockquote><b>Mrs.:</b>  [Nervous laughter]...put it [my hat] back on.  You look like a freak.
<br><br>
<b>Me:</b>  Wanna feel it?
<br><br>
<b>Mrs.:</b>  [More laughing]NOO!  Get away from me, freak!</blockquote>
<br><br>
<b><li>Did you lose a bet?</li></b>
<br><br>
Um, yeah, I heard that one already.  About 60,000 times, as a matter of fact.  You really aren't funny, if that's what you came up with.  The funnier variety was, "Who won the bet," which was actually amusing the first 3 or 4 times.  Well, maybe the first 2 or 3.
</ol>

The question that I ask myself is, "where did you get that big dent in your skull?"  I've got a indentation not unlike a shallow tire tread just north of my right temple.  If anyone reading this remembers bashing my soft noggin into a shelf when I was a baby being carried, then go ahead and fess up.
