Yesterday morning, I was behind a car at a stop light, and there was a little black dog with his head sticking out of the passenger side window.  And I shit you not, the dog was wearing goggles.  I tried several times to get a cell phone picture, but the dog kept turning away as the picture took, and then Mrs. theskinnyonbenny phoned.  I got three shots of the back of the damn dog's head.
