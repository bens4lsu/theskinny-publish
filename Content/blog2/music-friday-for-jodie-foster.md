Like so many others, I was blown away by Jodie Foster's speech at the Golden Globe awards.  She wasn't crazy, she wasn't on drugs.  She was incredibly nervous.

She felt the need to come out publicly, even though her homosexuality is pretty much common knowledge.  And in the first time in human history when the reaction would have been positive, in front of Hollywood hotshots who wouldn't care if she was attracted to fried bologna.  But she still couldn't make herself say the words.

Even Clarice Fucking Starling get spooked by the idea of the potential public backlash!  It's both amazing and sad.  

Given the topic, my song selection this morning is cheesy, but I like the tune, and I would like it if the topic of the lyrics were something more mundane.  But this one brings some strong lyrics.

By the way, how long has <a href="http://azlyrics.com" target="_blank">azlyrics</a> been around?  They totally stole the look of their site from me.  (They could have done much better.)
