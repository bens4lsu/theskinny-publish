First of all, this is worth (another) watch:

Second, here's a video I took from Canal Street about an hour after the game.  Be warned that I had been drinking for about 10 hours at that point, and that I know I drop at least one F-bomb.  And it doesn't come close to doing justice to what it was like there, but hopefully, if you're interested, you might get some sense of it.

I also have a couple of short videos from before the game on Sunday posted over <a href="/vidHome.php" target="_blank">here</a>.  And if you've really got some time to kill, check the other video galleries from that page.  Other than "2004," they've all got new stuff posted.
