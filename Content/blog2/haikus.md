While walking the dogs last night, I made up two haikus.  One is based on my real life experience this week, and the other is not.  It's funnier to let you decide which is truthful.

<div style="margin-left:25px; margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px;">If I weren't so drunk
We would be making sweet love
I am falling as.....</div>

<div style="margin-left:25px; margin-bottom:30px;">Toy soldiers and socks
Magazine bits and pictures 
Mixed in Blossom's poo</div>

Longer post tomorrow (or maybe Monday if I don't get back to it this afternoon).
