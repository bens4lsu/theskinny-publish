I keep hearing V walking around singing a catchy little song. He sings,

<div style="padding-left:3.5em;">Momendecker
High in the 70s</div>

as if he's delivering a weather forecast for the fictional town of Momendecker.  I encourage this thought, and I've even kept on making up words that I'll sing once he gets the tune stuck in my head.

<div style="padding-left:3.5em;">Momendecker
High in the 70s
From the southwest
Expect a 12 knot breeze.</div>

 I know how he is when he catches an earworm, and he's definitely walking around his Jesus school singing this between classes.  So it's fortunate that he doesn't know the real words:
 
<div style="padding-left:3.5em;">Mom and Dad got
High in the 70s and
They found some pot
To plant a little seed in</div>

Have a listen:
