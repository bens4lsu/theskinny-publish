I keep hearing V walking around singing a catchy little song. He sings,

<blockquote>Momendecker<br />
High in the 70s</blockquote>

as if he's delivering a weather forecast for the fictional town of Momendecker.  I encourage this thought, and I've even kept on making up words that I'll sing once he gets the tune stuck in my head.

<blockquote>Momendecker<br />
High in the 70s<br />
From the southwest<br />
Expect a 12 knot breeze.</blockquote>

I know how he is when he catches an earworm, and he's definitely walking around his Jesus school singing this between classes.  So it's fortunate that he doesn't know the real words:
 
<blockquote>Mom and Dad got<br />
High in the 70s and<br />
They found some pot<br />
To plant a little seed in</blockquote>

Have a listen:
