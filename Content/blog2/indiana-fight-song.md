There's this video that I remember from my childhood.  It must have regularly come on right as Saturday morning cartoons were ending.  It was the opening bit to Indiana football or basketball games.

For some reason, this clip pops in to my head all of the time.  Until I searched it up to embed in this post, it had been 40 years since I've seen it, but it looks pretty much just like I remember.  But pretty much any mention of Indiana sports raises it into my consciousness.

It's been fun watching the Hoosiers enjoy their football run this year.  Hopefully, the clock doesn't strike midnight for them this Saturday against Ohio State.  If they win that game, I'm going to go get me a push broom and find an empty building full of classrooms to sing in.
