The rain, the rain, the rain.  Winter here means warm rain, followed by cold rain.  Then more cold rain.  Maybe a day or two of sunshine, and then it all starts again. 

Cold plus rain plus two very noisy active boys plus pets all in the house frazzles the nerves.  I cherish the brief moments where I can put on a relaxing, pretty song, close my eyes, and sip from my Scotch.  Except the Scotch brings sleep, and the end of my peace.  Winter is cruel, my friends.

Take a minute turn turn up the volume and listen with your eyes closed.
