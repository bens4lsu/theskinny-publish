What an exciting national championship game we got to see Monday night.  I was almost as fired up for Indiana as I get for LSU, and I was a billion times more sober, so I remember the game better.

I’m not going to recap a game that you either saw, saw highlights of, or don’t care about, but there is a little in-game subplot that you could have missed.

Fernando Mendoza is such a nerd.  I stayed up late enough for him to join Scott Van Pelt at the desk.  SVP asked him about talking to Tim Tebow before the game, and Mendoza called him “Mister Tebow” several times.

He may be a nerd who has every 23-year old in Bloomington —- male, female, and non-binary -- itching to attend to his carnal desires, but he’s still a nerd, nevertheless.

I’m not the only one who sees it.  This was from just after his 4th down run for a touchdown.
