description: Yesterday, I went to one of the normal places I go for coffee in the morning.  I set my bag down on a table outside, and then I noticed that there was some dried up jelly on the table.  I went in, paid for a coffee, and asked the lady for a towel to wipe the jelly.  I expected, "Oh, I'm sorry.  Let me come wipe that for you," but instead, she just handed me a damp towel.

Yesterday, I went to one of the normal places I go for coffee in the morning.  I set my bag down on a table outside, and then I noticed that there was some dried up jelly on the table.

I went in, paid for a coffee, and asked the lady for a towel to wipe the jelly.  I expected, "Oh, I'm sorry.  Let me come wipe that for you," but instead, she just handed me a damp towel.

I gotta tell you, that jelly had been there for a bit.  It really took some elbow grease to get it up.
