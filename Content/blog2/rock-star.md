description: A couple of short stories, first about mp3 players before Apple started making them, and then one that pulls the rock and roll out of those mp3 headphones right out into the real world.

Before Apple came out with the first iPod, I had a little mp3 player made by Compaq.  We used MusicMatch Jukebox to sync songs (and even used that with iPods for a while).

My Compaq mp3 player had about 10 levels for volume.  Level 1 was just a little to quiet for walking around with a small amount of ambient noise.  Level 2 was about as loud as a jet engine.  Levels 3 through 10 made your brain bleed.  Not being able to produce a volume knob should have been an early sign to short sell the Compaq stock.

I work with a client that sometimes sends me appreciative messages like this:

<a class="lightview centered" href="/img/rockstar.jpg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="/img/rockstar.jpg" alt="/img/rockstar.jpg"><br><span class="caption"></span></a>

This -- along with a moving sing-a-long with Nirvana in the car this morning -- has me thinking that I should give up software and become an honest to goodness rock star.  I have just a few hurdles to overcome:  I'm in my 40s, I'm fat, I don't sing all that well, and I don't play an instrument.  

All of that can be overcome if I find a good producer.  I would OWN the stage!
