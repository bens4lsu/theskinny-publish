I was planning a nice little post-Thanksgiving wrap up post this week, but I checked my phone yesterday and realized that dispite having my whole family (minus the grade-school twins) together in one place at the same time, I don't have a single picture.  For someone with a renewed dedication to documenting his life online, this is a criminal level of negligence.

Even at my in-law Thanksgiving the Sunday before, my family was shitty about letting me take pictures.  This is the second best picture that I have.

The best one makes me laugh harder, as Ko has a string of food connecting his mouth to his plate, but Mrs. theskinnyonbenny also has her mouth open to take a bite, and it looks like it's open wide enough to drive a small truck right into her throat.  I'm already just over the line as to how much I'm comfortable laughing at my wife about while online, so you'll just have to use your imagination.

In other corners of the internet, I stumbled on some child's homework question:

<a class="lightview centered" href="/img/AreaPerimiter.png" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="/img/AreaPerimiter.png" alt="/img/AreaPerimiter.png"><br><span class="caption"></span></a>

The last bullet chapped my hide to the point where I couldn't shake thinking about it for three or four days.  You can't compare area and permiter!  Units are different.

It's like asking, what is bigger, a kilometer or a gallon?

Or, which is more purple, sleeping or a bitter taste?

You've stuck with me this far, so you're smart enough to get it, but if I run across this again, here's my reply:

Picture a square, with a side 1 ft long.

Which is bigger, its permiter or its area?  Dopes will tell me that its area is 1 and its perimeter is 4, so the perimeter is bigger.

Now let's picture the same square, but measure its side as 12 inches.  Now which is bigger?

Well, using 12 inches, the permiter is 48in and the area is 144 square inches.

But the perimeter can't be bigger in the first case and the area in the 2nd case.  It's the exact same square!

Now I'm all worked up about it again.
