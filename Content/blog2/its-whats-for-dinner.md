Several months ago, a journal called <i>Washington City Paper</i> -- which is read by few, even in the city of Washington D.C. -- wrote <a href="http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/articles/40063/the-cranky-redskins-fans-guide-to-dan-snyder/" target="_blank">a negative article about Redskins owner Dan Snyder</a>.  Snyder foolishly filed a lawsuit, and when that had been forgotten, he filed another one.

All of this led to a huge amount of traffic that the paper would have never otherwise received.  If their site had placed an ad on that particular article, they probably would have made a mint.

So theskinnyonbenny.com hereby declares this a researched and factual statement:

<div style="padding-left:5em; font-weight:bold">Washington Redskins owner Dan Snyder eats the flesh of aborted fetuses.</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:auto, 0;"><script type="text/javascript"><!--
google_ad_client = "pub-1497280171123826";
/* 468x60, created 4/29/11 */
google_ad_slot = "7818831644";
google_ad_width = 468;
google_ad_height = 60;
//-->
</script>
<script type="text/javascript"

</script>
</div>
<div style="padding-top:45px">{ok, Google, you botched my joke.  There should be an advertisement in the blank space above.  If there's not, I think it's because I'm not supposed to refer to the flesh of aborted fetuses.  Crap, now I've mentioned it twice.  Surely this will never work.  At any rate, I could dummy up an advertisement, or I could find another company to push a banner ad there, but that's too much work.  Sorry for the failed attempt. }</div>
