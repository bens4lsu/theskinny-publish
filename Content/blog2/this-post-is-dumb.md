This just in:  LSU running back Charles Scott and CNN's Anderson Cooper announced the beginning of a name summit conference.  The conference would potentially open the door for a full name swap, allowing both parties to have one first name and one last name, like any normal person.  There is no current information on which names might be traded, or how soon a transaction might occur.  Spokesmen for both parties refused to rule out a three way trade with other teams, or one involving future picks in the name draft.
