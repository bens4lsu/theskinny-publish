I'm trying to put together a playlist whose common thread is that all of the songs have to do with humans fighting a war against the robots, humans having been annihilated by robots, or robots plotting to take over the humans in some form.  On top of this being a cool theme, based on the small collection that I've found, the music is really good too.

So far, I have only the following songs.

<table border="1" cellpadding = "5">
<tr><th>Song</th><th>Band</th><th>Comments</th></tr>
<tr><td>Citizens of Tomorrow</td><td>Tokyo Police Club</td><td>How did I miss this song for so long?  I've listened to the album dozens of times without catching that this is a great tune.  It's at the top of the rotation right now.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots, Part 1</td><td>The Flaming Lips</td><td>Another great song.  Having failed to learn any kid songs or lullabies before our trip to Russia, I sang this to try to get Vanya to sleep on the plane ride back.  It didn't work.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Robots</td><td>Flight of the Conchords</td><td>The version on the EP is a little different than the version on the first episode of the <a href="http://theskinnyonbenny.com/blog2/archives/309">TV show</a>.  The TV show's is a bit better, but they buried the "binary solo" until the closing credits.  It's the funniest part of the song.  (Lyrics go, "zero zero zero zero zero zero one, zero zero one one...."  I guess you really have to hear it.  It's not funny at all in typed text.)</td></tr>
</table>

I considered but rejected tracks from Radiohead's OK Computer, because I paid attention to the lyrics, and I'm not really sure what they're about.  At any rate, I don't hear of killing humans or fights between computers or humans, and I think it might be more about how we as people follow orders blindly like robots.  No offense to frequent commenter Pablo Honey, but I don't think it fits.

I'm sure there are enough songs for me to put together a 10-12 song playlist.  This is all I could come up with today, but I haven't had too long to think it over.  If you know of more, please send me an email, or drop a comment in the bottom of this page.  If I come up with something good, I'll post a follow-up.
