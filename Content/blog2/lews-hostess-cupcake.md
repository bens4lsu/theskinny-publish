I came so close to having filled a whole month with <a href="/dailyphoto">daily pictures</a>, which would have been the first time I managed to do it in all of the years that I've been posting a photo of the day.  

All I had to do was to look for something funny online.  Like this -- the signature of the new Treasury Secretary -- which has caused some outcry about something this ugly being on the dollar bills.  There's no way you can look at this and not laugh.

The last I read, he had to promise to change his signature.  Who can do that?

<table class="center"><tr><td><img src="/img/lewssignature.jpg" alt="lews signature" width="500px" /></td></tr><tr><td class="caption">Lew's signature.  I don't remember his last name, and I'm too lazy to look it up.</td></tr></table>

He obviously practiced his signature as a kid while looking at the top of a Hostess Cupcake.
