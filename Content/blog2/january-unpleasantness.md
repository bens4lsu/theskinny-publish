I don't suppose that many people heard that I was going to work for myself and pictured me on a cold floor in a cold house, tying a <i>freaking necktie</i> at 5:30 in the morning on a cold January day.  But that's exactly how I found myself yesterday morning.

Shortly after that, I heard the kid calling.  I went up to his room, picked him out of bed, and brought him down to watch cartoons from our bed, where Mrs. theskinnyonbenny still tried to hold on to those last precious Z's.  As I was walking away, I noticed pee pee on the cuff of my shirt.  And that was the only ironed shirt that would work with those pants, so I had to punt my whole getting dressed and start all over again.

This is just one example of much unpleasantness that I've experienced lately.  Nothing really bad or tragic has happened, but I haven't been getting a lot of yucks since New Years.  The weekend between Christmas and New Year's, I cleaned out my shop.  The weekend after New Year's, we cleaned out the attic (and you should <a onclick="window.open('/pg3.php?spgmGal=050%20-%20Christmas%202008','050Christmas2008','width=1024, height=768, toolbar=no, location = no, directories=no, menubar=no, resizable=yes, scrollbars=no');"  >check out what we found up there</a>).  And then last weekend, we did the garage.  All three were piled so thick with crap that you couldn't work your way through.

Now, Mrs. thskinnyonbenny is out of town for the weekend.  Normally, I would be excited to have the weekend to do something fun with my kid.  We would go sailing, go camping, ride bikes, or cast a line -- he's really been wanting to try to catch a fish.  But all of that happens outside, and it's going to be butt cold this weekend.  So I don't really know what I'll do, cooped up inside with a talkative Tasmanian Devil all weekend.
