"For God's sake, get rid of the plug!"  That was pretty much the first thing that a friend of mine said when I picked up the ringing phone yesterday evening.

Of course, I haven't put up a new post in a long time.  And that picture of the plug takes up more than its share of real estate on the excerpt that automatically gets written to the home page.  And I've been home for a week.  And I'm not working again.  So what's been up?

I'd love to blame it entirely on new parenting duties.  And there has been a heck of a lot of visiting, doctors, food and pacifier shopping, and working on our vocabulary (mostly a sound like AAAHH!, a sentance that goes like baa-baa-baa-baa-baa-baa, a cheerful singsong GOI GOI GOI, and crying), and learning how to walk.

But in truth, there are a lot more boring things that are taking time.  Dog damage to my sprinkler system.  Failed plants in window boxes.  A complete lack of unspoiled food when we returned.

And three weeks of television season finales to catch up on by DVR.  What can I say about the Sopranos ending in an unexplainable blackout that hasn't been covered already?

So for the rest of the summer, my goal is two posts a week, plus a reasonably consistent picture of the day.  Plus, I have a couple of new pages that I've been meaning to do that I'm going to try to complete this summer.

To imitate <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20130517074346/http://www.princesssparklepants.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">my sister's blog</a>, I'll take a moment to complain about my health.  I've had the Raspy Russian Crud (true medical designation) in my lungs for the better part of the last month, and it's keeping me from something that I've been looking forward to for a while:  singing my work email to music.  I know.  That reads like it's going to be quite a waste of time, but just you wait.

We took my new first mate sailing on Sunday.  He slept on the cabin floor while we had a rough sail in 15 knot wind and heavy chop.  He seemed to enjoy it while he was awake, though.
