</skinny:nohome>I came across this photo yesterday on an <a href="http://about.com">about.com</a> entry about cotton candy.  I have never seen anyone -- man, woman, or child -- look so angry about eating cotton candy.<br />
<br />
What happened here?  Have they already taken five rolls of film like this?  If so, wouldn't there be a better shot than this one?  Does he just dislike it?  If so, couldn't they have found a million other kids who did like it?<br />
<br />
I'm baffled.
