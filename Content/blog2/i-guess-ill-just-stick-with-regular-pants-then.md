Tyler posted this magazine ad on his blog a few weeks ago.  I don't know how old this is, but it looks to be a relic.  But today, I dialed the 800 number to see if I could order a pair.

The phone rang three times, and then the answer was a long, indecipherable company name.

I tried to put my most cheerful and eager voice on.  "Hi, do you still carry the Chuck Norris Action Jeans?"

"The waaaaaat?" was the man's slow and disgusted reply.  I might as well have asked if he could fax me a bathtub full of turkey livers.

"You know, the Chuck Norris Action Jeans,"  I chirped enthusiastically.

"No sir.  We don't."  He was still disgusted for some reason.

I encourage you to call and attempt an order yourself.  In case it's hard to read, the number is 800-526-2787.

Let me know how it goes.

<h3>2025 update:  the link to incoherentblog.com is removed, as its pages aren't even there on the wayback machine.  I fear they are lost forever.  Likewise, the original photo for this post was just linked to that site, so I'm only guessing that this is the image.  There are a lot of similar ones these days.
<br>
<br>As tempted as I am to try, I did not dial the number.  If you do, let me know how it goes.  Even if it's in 17 more years into the future.<h3>
