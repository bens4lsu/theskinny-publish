Tyler posted this magazine ad on <a href="http://incoherentblog.com" target="_blank">his blog</a> a few weeks ago.  I don't know how old this is, but it looks to be a relic.  But today, I dialed the 800 number to see if I could order a pair.

The phone rang three times, and then the answer was a long, indecipherable company name.

I tried to put my most cheerful and eager voice on.  "Hi, do you still carry the Chuck Norris Action Jeans?"

"The waaaaaat?" was the man's slow and disgusted reply.  I might as well have asked if he could fax me a bathtub full of turkey livers.

"You know, the Chuck Norris Action Jeans,"  I chirped enthusiastically.

"No sir.  We don't."  He was still disgusted for some reason.

I encourage you to call and attempt an order yourself.  In case it's hard to read, the number is 800-526-2787.

Let me know how it goes.
