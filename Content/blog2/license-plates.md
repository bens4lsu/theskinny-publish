I don't remember where I was or what the source was, but a week or two ago, I heard that you could get LSU license plates for your car in Texas.

Then, just the other day, while out and about with the family, I saw what I thought was a new and more attractive LSU plate at a stop sign.  On closer examination, it revealed itself as a Mississippi plate.

Giving in to cynicism, Mrs. theskinnyonbenny took this as a symptom of the fact that our college graduates tend to move out of state, while Louisiana fails to attract the best and brightest from other states.  Giving in to societal isolationism, I noted that she may be right, but that I would be a little bit angry to see a Louisiana plate that supports Ole Miss.
