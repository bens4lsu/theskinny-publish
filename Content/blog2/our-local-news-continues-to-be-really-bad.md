A few people caught me on the 6:00 news the other day.  I finally had a chance to find the segent online, but it's the version from the 10:00, and I didn't make the cut for late-night.  I didn't see it myself, but I've heard from a few who did.

By the way, I was the one who told the reporter to go hunt down the Onion video that they show during the segment.

All I was trying to do was to throw out some trash on my way into a convenience store.  They were standing by the trash can.  I thought that they were waiting for someone in particular to show up, and as I tossed my garbage, the lady started asking quesitons.  As I answered, the camera guy lifted his camera and started shooting.  

If I had known it was coming, I could have tried to put on a straight face and answered with things like, "I only rent movies that feature elderly ladies wearing nothing but bras and panties."  Or, "Do these redbox machines give you an option for betamax?"  Or, "You work at the TV station.  Can you tell me what's going to happen on <i>Lost</i>?"
