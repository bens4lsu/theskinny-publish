Here's a song lyric that jumped out at me as I listened to background music today.  It's from a blues song called "Down Homegirl," performed by Alvin Robinson.  I don't know if Alvin wrote the tune or is just singing it.  

I didn't look this up, I'm just transcribing what I hear.

Lawd I swear
The purfume you wear
Were made out of turnip greens

Every time
I kiss you girl
It taste like pork an' beans

I know it's tough to appreciate without the music, but isn't that one of the most fantastic pieces of poetry you've ever heard?
