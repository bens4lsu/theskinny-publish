When you take your dogs to dog training, you spend a lot of time working with them on sit, stay, etc., and then you let the dogs rest and get a lecture about things you can do to keep your dog from being a bad dog.

For example, they teach you that if your dog likes to chew on the leg of your coffee table, rub the leg down with soap, so the dog learns that it tastes bad.

The other night, I unwrapped a new bar of soap and put in in the soap dish in the bathtub.  Several hours later, Mrs. theskinnyonbenny found a chewed up bar of soap in our bed.

How do you prevent that, Miss Smarty-Pants dog trainer?
