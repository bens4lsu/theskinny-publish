The other day, I came in to work, and was told that I look "snazzy."  From my perspective, I looked like I always look, but there must have been something different that day.  I like the thought of "unintentionally snazzy" being a phrase to describe me, though.

I think that most men look in the mirror and see an above-average guy looking back at them.  In half the cases (obviously, since we're comparing to average), they are wrong.  In my case, I am oh-so right.

Here's a story to illustrate:  A coworker of mine had posted on the wall of her cube, a nice little drawing of her granddaughter.  One week, while she was out of town, I hung a photograph of myself over that drawing.  She left it covering the little girl's picture for a months.

<a class="lightview alignright" href="/img/annscube.jpg" data-lightview-caption="Ann's cube wall, in its current state.  That's me on the left, and the picture that I hid for months on the right." data-lightview-group="group1" style="width:350px;"><img src="/img/annscube.jpg" alt="/img/annscube.jpg"><br><span class="caption">Ann's cube wall, in its current state.  That's me on the left, and the picture that I hid for months on the right.</span></a>

I just noticed that the picture of the girl is back up, but instead of take me down, Ann wend and found another hanger, so that I could be pictured side-by-side next to her grandkids in perpetuity.  This is high comedy.

While I'm talking about work, I'll mention the departure of Tom the programmer, whose last day is Tuesday.  Tom works closely with Toni, and when I come in early, I can hear them squawking like a married couple from 6:00 to about 8:00.  Once the office starts to fill up with people at 8:00, Tom clams up, and there's no sound from him for the rest of the day.

Their bickering is a regular source of amusement for me.  Yesterday, it was over how some information was stored in the database.  I prompted me to email them this haiku:

<center><b>A Haiku for Toni</b>
There are no zeros<br />Saved there in the database<br />Open it and see</center>

I know that this really isn't amusing anyone other than me, but sometimes self-amusement is reward enough.

Since only the real nerds have stuck with me this long, we came up with this joke earlier in the week:

<center><b>A programmers grocery list</b></center><blockquote>< ?php include("/home/users/web/b1051/sl.theskinn/public_html/blog/archives/include117.txt"); ?></blockquote>

Getting back to my unintentional snazziness, my next hair do will be a real hum-dinger.  Consider yourself warned.
