The other day, I came in to work, and was told that I look "snazzy."  From my perspective, I looked like I always look, but there must have been something different that day.  I like the thought of "unintentionally snazzy" being a phrase to describe me, though.<br />
<br />
I think that most men look in the mirror and see an above-average guy looking back at them.  In half the cases (obviously, since we're comparing to average), they are wrong.  In my case, I am oh-so right.
<span class="spanEndPreview">&nbsp;</span><br /><br />Here's a story to illustrate:  A coworker of mine had posted on the wall of her cube, a nice little drawing of her granddaughter.  One week, while she was out of town, I hung a photograph of myself over that drawing.  She left it covering the little girl's picture for a months.<br />
<br />
<table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 border=0 align=right><tr><td width=5 rowspan=2><spacer type=block width=5 height=1></spacer></td><td width=275><img src="/img/annscube.jpg" aborder=0 vspace=4/></td></tr><tr><td width=275><font face="verdana, arial, geneva" size=1 color=#666666><b>Ann's cube wall, in its current state.  That's me on the left, and the picture that I hid for months on the right.</b></font></td></tr></table><br />
<br />
I just noticed that the picture of the girl is back up, but instead of take me down, Ann wend and found another hanger, so that I could be pictured side-by-side next to her grandkids in perpetuity.  This is high comedy.<br />
<br />
While I'm talking about work, I'll mention the departure of Tom the programmer, whose last day is Tuesday.  Tom works closely with Toni, and when I come in early, I can hear them squawking like a married couple from 6:00 to about 8:00.  Once the office starts to fill up with people at 8:00, Tom clams up, and there's no sound from him for the rest of the day.<br />
<br />
Their bickering is a regular source of amusement for me.  Yesterday, it was over how some information was stored in the database.  I prompted me to email them this haiku:<br />
<br />
<center><b>A Haiku for Toni</b><br />
There are no zeros<br />Saved there in the database<br />Open it and see</center><br />
<br />
I know that this really isn't amusing anyone other than me, but sometimes self-amusement is reward enough.<br />
<br />
Since only the real nerds have stuck with me this long, we came up with this joke earlier in the week:<br />
<br />
<center><b>A programmers grocery list</b></center><blockquote>< ?php include("/home/users/web/b1051/sl.theskinn/public_html/blog/archives/include117.txt"); ?></blockquote><br />
<br />
Getting back to my unintentional snazziness, my next hair do will be a real hum-dinger.  Consider yourself warned.
