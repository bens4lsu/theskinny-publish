Congratulations to my cousin Gabrielle and her new husband Alex.

We went to the wedding this past weekend.  Saturday, we hung around the marina in shorts, and Sunday was freezing and blowing a half-gale.  I bet Velvet Elvis thought she was back in the Med.

The wedding was a good one.  The food was excellent, and it's always nice to gather with a group of people who like you and who compliment your kids.

A quick video:

This starts with V doing a little line dancing.  Then, there's a bit from when I went out there.  As soon as I was there, Barf said, "oh, you don't know the rules."
        
"Oh, is this some sort of line dance?"

"Yeah"

So I just decided to go all-in and wing it.

I'm glad V did some filming.  It's pretty funny.

This was almost pushed out of mind by the events of Tuesday morning.  We had a snowstorm that dwarfs any winter weather that we've ever had here.

We didn't do much other than a couple of short play sessions, cook, and watch TV.  Mrs. theskinnyonbeeny and I worked, but I at least pulled my laptop down near a window so I could look out at it all.

Hugely eventuful, but not really all that interesting or funny.

Oh, I did already post this as a [daily photo](a href-"/dailyphoto/2025/20250121/"), but I like how this set of images tells a little story.
