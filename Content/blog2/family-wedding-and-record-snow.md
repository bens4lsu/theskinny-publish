Congratulations to my cousin Gabrielle and her new husband Alex.

This starts with V doing a little line dancing.  Then, there's a bit from when I went out there.  As soon as I was there, Sarah said, "oh, you don't know the rules."<br><br>
        
"Oh, is this some sort of line dance?"

"Yeah"<br><br>

So I just decided to go all-in and wing it.

I'm glad V did some filming.  It's pretty funny.
