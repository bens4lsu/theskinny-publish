A couple of weeks ago, we had a hellacious thunder storm come through during the middle of the night.  I was awake upstairs, in a small bed with Vanya and Lily.

We had a huge flash and bang.  I don't know if it was the lighning or the sound of the thunder, but I literally felt it shake me.  The inside of my mouth felt weird.

It was kind of scary.

Lily started to temble, snugged in against us.

Vanya and I talked a little bit about how the lound thunder really scared her, and how the trembling is just something that natually happens when you're really scared.

"I know!" he chimed in.

"Her can share my kahki, so she won't be scared."

And then he spread out his little blue security blanket, stretching it from his chin to down over Lily's head.

It was the sweetest thing I've ever seen.

And you know what?  

Lily stopped trembling right away.
