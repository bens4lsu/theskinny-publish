Yesterday, I was at my parents's house while they were coincidentally at an appointment a block from where I had finished the school drop off circuit. They went to lunch right after, and then drove back to their house.

At 4:00 in the afternoon, I was talking to my mom in her kitchen, and I opened their to-go box. There were a couple of pieces of pizza in there, and they looked good. I wasn't really hungry, but I wanted to try.

"Those look good, can I have them?" I asked.

"Sure."

So I ate a piece. And I started another.

As I was halfway through that last piece, Mom shouted up the stairs, "Danny, pick up a sandwich after rehearsal, Ben's eating your supper!"

The fuck, mom?
