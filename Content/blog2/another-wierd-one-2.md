Here's another wierd dream that I just had.

Mrs. theskinnyonbenny and I had made good, and we were living in a big ol' house on the water somewhere or other.  By chance, Lisa Marie Presley was our next door neighbor.  We had gotten to be friends with her, and she was kind of cool -- not at all like the freak that she is in real life.

Our budding friendship was dashed, however, because she noticed that our boat was named *Velvet Elvis*.  Since we were on the water, she saw the boat every time she went out into the yard, and everything was awkward after that.
