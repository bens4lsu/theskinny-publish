I've been a fan of horse racing for pretty much my entire life. It's a great sport, featuring beautiful, amazing athletes that love what they do and never hold out for a better contract. 

But it's harder and harder to turn a blind eye to the fact that thoroughbreds have been bread to the point where they're too fragile. <a href="http://deadspin.com/5927454/saratoga-opens-with-three-dead-horses-on-the-first-day" target="_blank">Three dead horses on three races</a> is insane. And if this is happening at Saratoga, how bad must it be at the shitty, barely-profitable tracks?

It woul be really hard to do, but I'm tempted to give it up, even as Louisiana becomes an even more important prep host for the triple crown races.
