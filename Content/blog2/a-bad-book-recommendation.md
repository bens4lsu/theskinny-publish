description: My Kindle advertises a book when I shut it off.  That's fine, but it picks some that really make very little sense.  I mean, they have my reading history.  How hard would it be to pick something I might like?

What would make Amazon think this is the book to advertise on my lock screen?

I mean, they have my reading history.  How hard would it be to pick something I might like?

I'd have to have gotten a partial lobotomy and then served a new drug cocktail that lets me travel into into the story as if it were a real universe.

Even then, I'd just pop in for the sex scenes.

This was sitting on our counter when a friend came over for a drink the other night.  It's just embarrassing.

Oh, that reminds me.  It's been a long time, but I grabbed this screen shot of a family member's Goodreads activity one night.

It's funny, but to be clear, I'm not making fun.  Read whatever makes you happy.

But for me, it's definitely not going to be any of these Breathlesses.  And it isn't going to be _That Boy_.
