It's time for a new limerick.

<table cellpadding="20px"><tr>
<td valign="top">Believe in it if you dare
A blanket made from pubic hair
But don't be alarmed
It keeps Carla warm
As she sits and works in her chair</td>

The background story there is that I happened to be at the urinal at the same time that Tyler was in the bathroom one day.  I looked down, and made an observation.  "There are enough pubes on this thing to knit a sweater."

Tyler pondered that, and fantasized that as a bazillionaire, he would get someone to knit a pubic hair sweater, just for the novelty of it all.

An hour later, Carla comes to the meeting, clad in her blanket, and the limerick came to me straight away.

While I'm talking about life at the office, here are some emails that I've held on to.  These are actual emails, sent to hundreds of people, with only the names withheld.

I will volunteer to come in early tomorrow morning to cook up some little sausage/crescent roll wraps if you all will help me pay for it.  If you are interested and would like to have those tasty little treats in the morning....Dot Iâ€™m talking to you....please stop by today and drop off a dollar or two and Iâ€™ll buy as much as I collect plus a little more.

I'll be buying the food tonight and I'll start preparing them by 7:00 a.m. tomorrow morning so please try and donate today and not tomorrow.

I can almost smell them cooking......mmmmmmmmmmmmmm</blockquote>

This was one of many emails that day orgnizing the logistics of making pigs-in-a-blanket the next morning.

Subject: We will have shrimp!!!

Hi there,
Just got a call from our shrimper.  He's on his way in with a load of really nice, big shrimp - 15-20 to pound.  He said he has about 1,000 lbs. Due to increase in his fuel costs, his price will be $4.25 per pound.

He said he has a couple of hundred pounds of medium shrimp - 36-40 to pound and will sell those for $3.25 per pound.

As before, he'll need total orders of at least 800 lbs. to make trip to B.R. on Friday.

Please e-mail me directly, ASAP if you're interested.
Thanks!!
