Shelly has been sending me the occasional link from <a href="http://overheardinnewyork.com" target="_blank">overheardinnewyork.com</a>.  This one came with a comment.

Hippie woman: Ma'am, what did you just feed my dog? <br>
Elderly woman: A treat. <br>
Hippie woman: What was it? Was it meat? <br>
Elderly woman: Well, not really, it was a sausage. <br>
Hippie woman: What is wrong with you?! My dog is a vegetarian! What if he had a food allergy?! <br>
Elderly woman: Right. Go away.

I had my own overheardinnewyork moment when we were there a couple of weekends ago.

It's not really that funny on its own, but it would definitely make the site if I wasn't too lazy to send it in.

You might be wondering about Stacie's "incident" that Shelly references.  First of all, "The brown dog" was Jeeves, who was often left out of play by Lili, Shelly's two dogs, and Staicie's other dog, who all happened to share a mainly black and white color scheme.  We postulated that he was an ethnic outcast -- a dog version of a Mexican kid that the others didn't want to play with.  And I started calling him "Heeves," because that's how a Mexican might pronounce it if they tried to sound it out.

On to the incident.  Picture a tailgate party at LSU.  We're under a goup of tents, and there are ten thousand other people within reach.

Stacie spies some woman giving her dogs some treats.  She jumps out of her chair like someone had just set her ass on fire and sprinted full-bore toward the nice lady.

As she sprinted, she was screaming like a maniac.  "NO MEAT FOR THE BROWN DOG!  NO MEAT FOR THE BROWN DOG!"

Also, her hair turned into snakes.
