My sweet son V likes nothing more than shopping for trucks.  He apparently took his inquiry a little further this week, and entered his contact information into a form.  As soon as he started getting messages from the dealer, he got a little nervous.  

Here's a text he sent me.

<a class="lightview centered" href="/img/vanyamessage1.jpg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="/img/vanyamessage1.jpg" alt="/img/vanyamessage1.jpg" width="450px"><br><span class="caption"></span></a>

I know, he meant was NOT on purpose.

Also, can you believe that there are $90,000 trucks!?!

V shared with me his text exchange with a car salesman.

And below that, the salesman just told him to have a good day too.  I would have loved to see his face when he read, "I'll talk to you when I'm 16, but it will be a long time..."  I really appreciate that he didn't respond, "Fuck off, kid."

So thanks, Luke at Ralph Sellers.  I don't see us spending 90 grand on a truck, but if it happens, you can have the sale.
