A long time ago, I had a thing on the home page for "link of the week."  I did a poor job of keeping it updated, so I finally pulled it altogether.  However, I have a ton of things saved off to the side, and I can't even think of what else I would do with it.  So, I'm going to bring this feature back some time before the end of the year.

As an appetizer, here's a clip from the Maryland/NC State game this past Saturday.
