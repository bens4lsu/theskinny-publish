I got home late yesterday evening, and the Sharples were sitting out back in the Regal Beagle, bullshitting with Mrs. theskinnyonbenny.  Soon after I sat down, we had a conversation that went something like this.

Sharples:  So, do you guys know a good vet?

Me:  A vet?  Well, we go to that Bocage vet.  They're too expensive, but they're good.

Sharples:  'Cause I need a good vet.

Me:  Well they're the best we know of.  We haven't exactly sampled all of the vets in town.

(A pause)

Me:  Let's see, there was that place by Greco's.  They're cheap, but they botched someone's declaw.

Mrs. theskinnyonbenny laughs.

Me:  What?  Did you go through this already?

Mrs. theskinnyonbenny:  I had forgotten about the botched declaw.

Me:  Yeah, let's see....  Who was that?  Must have been Oscar or Felix.

Me:  After that was that place that's by Petz Plaza now.  Oscar licked off all of his flea spray.

I was starting to enjoy this history of abandoned veterinarians, but I got cut off.

Sharples:  I really need a good vet.

Me:  Why?  Is someone sick?

Sharples (flexing his bicep):  Yeah, these puppies are <i>sick</i>!

All of that just to get me to ask, "Is someone sick?"

Amanda told a similar story that was even better.  I'm not going to tell it just right, but someone she knew referred to something or other about "updog," trying to get the response "What's up dog?"

Instead, she replied, "Yeah.  I don't know what that is."
