I just heard that the Washington Redskins store had a Cyber Monday sale.  Great deals, we missed, but you had to go to the web site, pick out what you want, and <em>phone</em> them to place your order.

There are a thousand old ladies knitting afghans who have an ebay store that let you order without picking up the phone.  How about a billion dollar organization that can't?
