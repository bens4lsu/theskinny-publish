The 2nd great influx of animals has begun.
 
(The first influx was [in 2006](/gal/017%20-%20New%20Animals%20-%20Spring%202006/)).

Two kitties arrived last night, increasing the number of beings in our house with fish breath by at least 18%.  (I haven't done the math.)  Right now, they're nervous, but also curious to explore.

I got the one with white legs -- who I am told is a boy -- to sit with me for a bit this morning.  He wanted to squirm away, but in a few minutes, he succumed to pets and started a loud purr.

I haven't really handled the one with stripy legs -- who I am told is a girl, but she keeps putting herself where she is as close as she can be to look at me while being able to run for under-the-furniture shelter.

As far as I know, they don't have names yet.  V is the decider there.  In another day, their names will be "white legs" and "stripey legs" no matter what he decides officially.
