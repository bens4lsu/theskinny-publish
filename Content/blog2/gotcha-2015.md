Today is Vanya's <a href="/adop/page.php?fn=adj05292007.content">gotcha day</a>, so happy day to a wonderful, kind-hearted, enthusiastic kid who has an amazing ability to make people smile.

Our tradition is that the kids get to do pretty much what they choose, including a trip to the store to pick out a toy.  Sometimes, <a href="/blog2/archives/824">this process is even hilarious</a>.

My suggestion for today was to sleep late, catch breakfast at Christina's (V's favorite breakfast spot, which happens to be just a few blocks from the recital location), go to rehersal, and then get on with the day.

Sounds reasonable, right?

Mrs. theskinnyonbenny interpreted this as me confabulating two different options, so she spelled it out differently.

"We can either sleep late, go to the rehearsal, and then go eat, or we can get up, eat at Christina's, and then go to rehearsal, but if we do that, we'll have to get up around 9:30."

9:30?  AM?  What are we, a family of roosters?

No, my mistake.  I'm an old man, and 9:30 was "sleeping late" to me.
