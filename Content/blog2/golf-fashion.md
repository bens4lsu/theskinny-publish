Suppose I was a professional golfer.  And suppose that I found myself doing pretty well on a Sunday in a tournament.  Well enough that I'm in the final group, paired with Tiger Woods.

I would totally show up wearing a red golf shirt and black pants.  And when Tiger and I met on the first tee, I would be like, "oh shit...I didn't think....man, how embarrassing."
