In my mind, I had this text message exchange with Shelly on Saturday:

<div style="margin-left:3em">Me:  Where you at?

Shelly:  Eating pancakes.  Why?

Me:  Not sure.  H wants to know.

(later)

Me:  My bad.  We're working in the garden, and she was asking "Where's the hoe?"
</div><!--more-->
But while I chuckled about it several times during the day, I was in fact working on the garden, and I never had a chance to go put this into play.
