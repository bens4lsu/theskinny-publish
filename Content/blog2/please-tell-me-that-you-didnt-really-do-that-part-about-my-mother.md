Here's the least uplifting, but one of the most fun Christmas songs to come out in years.

I'm equal parts amused and horrified by Cindy Lauper's first lines:

<blockquote>I bought no tree this year
And I slept with your brother
I wrecked your Daddy's car
And went down on your Mother
</blockquote>

I'm not sure, but I think they decide that they'd like to spend Christmas together anyway.
