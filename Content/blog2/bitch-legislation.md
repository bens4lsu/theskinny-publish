Subject: New Laws


Today I wrote two new laws that everyone should have to comply with:

1.  if you stop in the middle of the intersection and my light turns green and you are blocking my way, I am fully entitled to ram into the side of your car and YOU have to pay for any damage done to my car.

2.  if you act like an immature rude bitch, I am clearly entitled at my own discretion to punch you in the face and you can't sue me for assault and battery or prosecute me for any crime.
