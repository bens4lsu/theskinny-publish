Subject: New Laws<br>
<br><br>

Today I wrote two new laws that everyone should have to comply with:
<br><br>
1.  if you stop in the middle of the intersection and my light turns green and you are blocking my way, I am fully entitled to ram into the side of your car and YOU have to pay for any damage done to my car.
<br><br>
2.  if you act like an immature rude bitch, I am clearly entitled at my own discretion to punch you in the face and you can't sue me for assault and battery or prosecute me for any crime.
