When we occasionally end up with an intelligent, friendly person working the front desk at APPRO, it doesn't take long before someone moves that person into a more prestigious position.  There's nothing wrong with that, except that it leads to long stretches of incompetent temps working the phones.  I remember one woman who was around for months, who always pronounced the company name as "APE-ro" instead of "AP-ro."<br />
<br />
I noticed the current front desk woman last week.  She seems friendly enough.  She's about the age and demeanor where you might expect her to be doting on new grandchildren.  I did notice that she stared at me bug-eyed one day as I crossed the lobby, but I figured she was just really curious, and I really haven't given her much thought one way or the other.<br />
<br />
Yesterday, two friends of mine came back from lunch, and she was staring off into space, laughing to herself.<br />
<br />
"What's so funny," one of them asked.<br />
<br />
"Well, there's just some crazy people in the world," she relied.<br />
<br />
They should have let the entire conversation end there.  But the other one pressed.  "What do you mean by that?"<br />
<br />
Which led to the following story.  I'm quoting as accurately as possible, to the best of my knowledge.<br />
<br />
<blockquote>Well, when I was six months old -- and I remember this like it was yesterday -- my mother put me down in a bassinet.  And this man came by.  He was a big man.  A black guy.  And when I looked over, he was masturbating in front of my sister.</blockquote><br />
<br />
At this point, the woman paused, which should have given them a chance to get out of there, but was instead wasted on stunned silence.<br />
<br />
<blockquote>And then, when I was in first grade, someone wrote a story about all of this happening.  I got in trouble for writing it, but it wasn't me.  Someone else wrote it.  It wasn't me.</blockquote><br />
<br />
I think she might have been getting belligerent at this point, so they moved on out in the lobby to let her laugh at her memories.<br />
<br />
I readily admit that this sounds like something that I would make up, but this one really did happen.  I guess I know where to go if I'm ever short of material to write about.<br />
