The boat gods again conspire against us having air conditioning on the boat.  

Just days before the generator gets replaced -- after months of wrangling, but ultimately under warranty -- we were running the air conditioning on shore power when it started to make an annoying screeching noise.  Shortly after that, it shut down.

I've traced the problem to the water pump.  Boat air conditioning uses sea water to move the heat out of the compressed gasses so that they can expand and blow cold.  No water pump means no air.

A water pump is better than the alternatives, but I should would just like to be able to have a nice cool cabin.

I bet every boat owner has their pictures mingled with happy, smiling people mixed with parts and placards.  Pictures like these.
