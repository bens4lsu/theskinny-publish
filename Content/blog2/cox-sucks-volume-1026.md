About six months ago, we got a letter from Cox telling us to come to their office and pick up some new gadgets that attach to our TIVO boxes.  The letter said we would need them in order to receive new features.  I dutifully went to the office, picked up the gadgets, and attached the first one to our TV.

After doing that, we didn't get many of our stations.  I called their support line, and shocker, the person had no idea what I was talking about.  She scheduled a guy to come to our house a number of days later.  He came out, said that the system wasn't ready for the new gadgets yet and that Cox shouldn't have sent the letters.  He disconnected them, we were back to normal, and he disappeared.

Fast forward to the present.  Many of our stations disappeared.  Mrs. theskinnyonbenny called.  Cox set up an appointment for Tuesday, between 3:00 and 5:00.

At 2:00 on Tuesday, Mrs. theskinnyonbenny got a call saying that the guy was at our house.  She was told that since no one was home, she would have to call back and schedule another day.  

Good God Almighty.  Could this have really happened?  Could someone with a customer service job really think it's okay to come when they weren't scheduled, and then make like it's the customer's fault?  You just can't make this stuff up.

I hate to imagine the tirade of curses that followed, but it was sufficient to make the customer service person hang up on Mrs. theskinnyonbenny.

Fortunately, I arrived at the house at that time.

And by now, you will have guessed the problem.  I wasn't getting many of the channels because at some random point, Cox flipped a switch, and after that, those boxes had to be installed in order for my television to work.

I should start a site where we can all post our stories about Cox.  There's something like this every time I talk to them, and it's an unfortunately frequent occurrence.
