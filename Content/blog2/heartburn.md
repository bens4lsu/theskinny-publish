If there's anything more boring than a blog where people recommend random music that they like (especially without a feature that allows you to play the song right then and there), then it's a diet blog.  I mention this only because I'm veering very close to boring diet blog territory with this post.  But stick with me a moment.

In my New Year's post, I mentioned the painful gut burning that I experienced all of New Year's day.  I resolved to give up meat and alcohol for two weeks.  My motivation wasn't really to get  thinner or noticeably more healthy.  I just wanted to stop the fire in my belly and to start pooping solids again.

I stuck with my resolution through LSU's Sugar Bowl.  I wavered a little that Friday night, but I only had three beers and some food with a little ground beef as an ingredient.  That Saturday, I had a gyros plate for dinner and a glass of wine.  But you see, I was the model of moderation.  During the national championship game on Monday night, I ate soup and drank tea.  What a bore.

My two weeks of good health is more or less over.  I think it's safe to say that I've extinguished that fire in my belly.
