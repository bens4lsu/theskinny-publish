Our friend Stacie recently moved to the Dallas area.  I picked up the phone one weekend right after she moved there and had a conversation that went something like this.
<!--more-->
<table><tr><td width =15><img src="/img/spacer.gif"/></td><td>
Stacie:  "Hey, what's on NBC in your house right now?"

Ben:  "Hang on let me check....Um...I'm not sure what this is.  I think it must be at commercial.  Give me a minute."

S:  "Is it a rodeo?"

B:  "Uh, yeah, I guess.  Are they really showing rodeo on NBC?"

S:  "Whew.  I was worried that they really showed this all the time here."
</td></tr></table>

In my surprise to actually find rodeo, I missed a great opportunity.  The conversation should have gone more like this.

<table><tr><td width =15><img src="/img/spacer.gif"/></td><td>
Stacie:  "Hey, what's on NBC in your house right now?"

Ben:  "Hang on let me check....Um...Ice skating.  I fucking hate how they drown you in ice skating right before the Olympics start."

(As I recall, Stace loves that ice skating crap.)

S:  (sounding a little panicked) "What?  Seriously?  You really have skating on NBC?"

B:  (cooly) "Yeah.  Why the surprise?  What's on there?"

S:  "A rodeo!"

B:  (feigning shock)  "Rodeo?!!!  Who the hell shows rodeo?  Who would watch that?  Boy, I hope you subscribed to a cable plan with lots of choices."
</td></tr></table>

If you think about it, it is actually pretty bizarre that this is what NBC chose to air on a Saturday afternoon in February.  Did they even air it in the big metropolitan areas?  I have to think that they could have found an irrelevant NBA game, a Senior Tour golf event, or the Olympic trials for the curling team, and any of those would have blown away the rodeo.

But I wear a belt buckle small enough to fit between my gut and where my pants zipper starts, so what do I know?
