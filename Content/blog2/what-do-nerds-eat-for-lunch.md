I just received this invite to a lunch today.  The emphasis in the message is mine.

<blockquote>From: ______________

Subject: BRAG Lunch today

The BRAG Lunch is a monthly, informal round-table lunch
for developers within the Greater Baton Rouge area. It is FREE and open to
developers of all skill levels.

**______________ will be starting us out talking on the
Liskov Substitution Principle and we'll see where we go from there.** Should
be yet another great meeting. If you would like to come, please use the
eventbrite link below to register so that we can get a rough estimate of the
space needed.

We hope to see you there!</blockquote>

Liskov Substitution Principle?

Let's go to Wikipedia:

<blockquote>In object-oriented programming, the Liskov substitution principle (LSP) is a particular definition of a subtyping relation, called (strong) behavioral subtyping, that was initially introduced by Barbara Liskov in a 1987 conference keynote address entitled Data abstraction and hierarchy. It is a semantic rather than merely syntactic relation because it intends to guarantee semantic interoperability of types in a hierarchy, object types in particular.</blockquote>

Well, I hope I would be able to hang in the "we'll see where we go from there" part of the conversation, because I don't see myself elaborating on the nuances of Liskov.

Unfortunately, I have something that I have to do at lunch today.  But hey, it's nice to be invited.
