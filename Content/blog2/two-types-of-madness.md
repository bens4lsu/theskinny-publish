Madness 1 -- A bit of advice:  If you aren't using the NCAA March Madness iphone app, you're asleep at the wheel.  You can watch every game, of course.  The picture is crystal clear, and you can pause the action and pick back up like it's on a DVR.  You can watch highlights, box scores, or see the bracket in real time.  It's a front-pager this week and next.

 Madness 2:  A few days ago, this somehow made it through my spam filter.  I haven't seen one of these in years.

I know that I should have deleted this, but I picked it up very late at night, and decided to reply.

<blockquote>Me Neurou,

Aahh yes, I remember uncle Eng.Michael fondly.  Iâ€™m sure you think his name is odd.  It is considered odd in America as well, but we often put random periods in our names.  In fact, my own middle name is Bri.Applebutter, which is one of the traditional names in our family.

I was last out to the Republic of Benin to visit uncle Eng.Michael and his lovely family in 2004.  What a charming group!  I found Benin to be a horribly hot and dry place, especially considering its dearth of liquor stores.  Fortunately my cousin (Eng.Michaelâ€™s daughter Laura.Basketball) was just back from university, and she had smuggled a little bit of alcohol back in her suitcase.  If I remember correctly, she had 12 bottles of Cuban rum, 24 bottles of Tennessee Bourbon, 9 bottles of Scotch, 11 bottles of tequila, and a half pound of choice marijuana.  She turned out to be a little slut, but she did have the ability to put away some booze.  Needless to say, we had quite a weekend!

I remember warning my uncle against taking his family out to the oil tanker.  There was really no reason to have his wife and daughter out there is such a dangerous area.  It turns out that for some reason, they had a belief that mermaids swam below the tanker, along with giant starfish and aliens from the future.  They were most convincing that it was possible (especially after indulging in the marijuana), and I was almost myself convinced to travel to the sea in order to get a look for myself.

As luck would have it, I am a major stockholder in the BANQUE ATLANTIQUE.  It will suit my needs quite well if you turn over my inheritance to the bank, as they suggest.

Kindest personal regards,
Ben

If I've received any response to this, then that response did get filtered out.  

Incidentally, I have no idea where spam messages to my work email go.  I have a Spam folder in my mailbox, but there are no messages there.  I find it impossible to believe that I'm not getting spam at that address (other than the one above).  I'll have to make a mental note to look into it.
