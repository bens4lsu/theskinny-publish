After last night's national championship game, ESPN went to Auburn, AL, to show us live footage of the fans covering the trees of Toomer's corner with toilet paper.

Is there a worse tradition in college football?  Toilet papering trees is sooooo white trash.  If I were an Auburn fan, I would just have to shake my head in embarrassment at this most stupid way to celebrate a big win.  

Toomer's corner is the worst of the worst.  Here are the best and the worst college football traditions, straight from the top of my head.

<table>
	<tr>
		<td>Best</td>
		<td>Worst</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Cool animals in the stadium:  Colorado's buffalo, Auburn's Eagle, and of course, Mike the Tiger on the field are all really cool.  Only partial credit for Texas's steer.  I'm not that impressed by a cow.</td>
		<td>Dogs on the field (Georgia, Texas A&M)</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Dotting the I at Ohio State, LSU's pregame.  I know, it's hard to give credit to any nerdy band stuff, but these are the exceptions.  (And this isn't a tradition, but you should see <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MREKsMPUdcg" target="_blank">Hawaii's stick figure performance</a>.)</td>
		<td>A band that plays anything from the Star Wars score.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Boating to the Game at Washington or Tennessee</td>
		<td>Sooner Schooner</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Calling the Hogs.  Best cheer in football, without a close second.</td>
		<td><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvyknw4VClE" target="_blank">Roll Tide</a></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>&nbsp;</td>
		<td>The Stanford Tree.  It's frightening and stupid at the same time.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>&nbsp;</td>
		<td>Touchdown Jesus.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>&nbsp;</td>
		<td>Kissing your date when your team scores.  Your dingbat Texas A&M date doesn't even know how many points go with that field goal.  And while we're on A&M, cheer practice -- or whatever you guys call it -- is stupid too.</td>
	</tr>
</table>

That's my list.  What did I miss?
