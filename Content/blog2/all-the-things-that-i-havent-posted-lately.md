Instead of blogging, I've spent a lot of time installing trim around windows, crown molding, light fixtures, and putting up paint.  It's unfortunate for my site, because I really had a lot to say in the past month that didn't get posted.  Here's a partial list of posts that I thought about doing but never got to in the past few weeks:
<!--more-->
<ul><li>The television writers are on strike, and their demand to get a tiny percentage of what we spend to view or download a show on the internet doesn't seem unreasonable to me.  But that said, the scripted television shows on the air were pretty bad even before the strike dwindled our choices.  So bad that <a href="http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20158840,00.html" target="_blank">one producer apologized for his show's shittiness</a>.  Wow.  

For the record, Showtime's <a href="http://www.sho.com/site/dexter/home.do" target="_blank"><i>Dexter</i></a> is the best drama on TV for the second fall in a row.  You should do yourself a favor and start watching the On Demand episodes of Season 2 now.</li>

<li>I missed my opportunity to share the grusome details about a gastric distress episode that I had in the parking lot of Wal Mart.  You should count your blessings, especially if you read near lunch time.</li>

<li>I completely failed to share my wonder of December 1, which is the Saturday where we went from wondering which interm coach would take the Tigers through the paces of the <strike>Peach</strike> Chick-Fil-A Bowl (or whatever hurting game we got) all the way to going to bed as a favorite to play in the national championship game.</li>

<li>Cutting down our own Christmas tree with an almost-two-year-old and two dogs.  When you have to carry the tree and saw to the car, there aren't enough free grown-up hands to wrangle the unrulies back where you want them to be.</li>

<li>Stories around my first full week as a solo parent, while Mrs. theskinnyonbenny took a business trip.  I won't fill my web site with videos about kids, but here's what we did during the Grinch that week.

<li>I had a long story that was something about lucid dreams, an engineering lab that lasted until well after dark, and Mitt Romney ending up as the professor who let us out.  On second thought, that probably would have been one of those posts that I started, reread, and deleted forever.</li></ul>

I've also tried to get Mrs. theskinnyonbenny to write a letter to the president of the cable company about the suckiness of Cox's service and support.  It's too long to elaborate here, but if she doesn't come through with a letter that I can repost, I'll definitely try to tell the story.
