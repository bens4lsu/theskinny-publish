<i>Velvet Elvis</i> completed her first race last night.

<a href="http://www.tammanyyachtclub.org/2011/Wed_Night_Spring1_2010/proof5.html" target="_blank">The results</a> are nothing to jump up and down about.  In fact, many would be embarrassed.  But it's fun to be listed.

But how about this:  in <a href="http://www.tammanyyachtclub.org/2011/Wed_Night_Spring1_2010/Wed_Night_Spring1_2010.html" target="_blank">the overall standings</a>, there are 7 boats in our division.  If we had shown up every week in the series, and assuming we finished dead last every week, we would currently be in third place.  That actually holds even if we had skipped week 1.

One of the racers who competes for first place every week told me that his entire first year, he finished last in every race he entered.  Over the years, he started beating the other boats one by one, working his way up the standings.  It will be nice when we catch up to the rest of the pack.
