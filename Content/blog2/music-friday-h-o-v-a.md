I wanted to feature something this morning from Madonna's new album, MDNA (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007LB1O3I/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=theskinnyonbe-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B007LB1O3I">Mdna [Explicit]</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=theskinnyonbe-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B007LB1O3I" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />) but to be honest, there's nothing there that excites me that much yet.  Maybe once I get to know the songs better.

So, the story that jumped out at me this week is that <a href="http://www.freep.com/article/20120413/ENT07/204130329/Obama-still-thinks-Kanye-West-is-a-jackass?odyssey=nav|head" target="_blank">President Obama prefers Jay-Z to that "jackass Kanye</a>."  Not the most controversial statement in the world.  Preferring Jay-Z to Kanye is like preferring chocolate to liverwurst.  Yes, it's that big a jump.

So, that said, here's Jay-Z's best of many, many good ditties.
