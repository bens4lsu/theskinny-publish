One of the first times I heard Mrs. theskinnyonbenny be good and truly vulgar was on a visit to her home town.  She referred to the Cotton Patch restaurant as "the rotten snatch."

We were with a bunch of her hometown friends, and they were so used to talking about the rotten snatch, that no one laughed, and I had to supress my natural inclination to guffaw.

I passed the building that was once the Rotten Snatch just before Thanksgiving, which reminded me of this.  I never got to try the food, and it's something else now, but it holds this special place in my heart.
