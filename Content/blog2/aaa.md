Tip of the cap to AAA.  I called last night because we had a car with a dead battery.  The only thing I had to type in for the computer is my account number.  Called again today, and their system must have associated my phone number and the account, because I got right to a human without having to enter anything.  She confirmed me by name, and I didn't have to read off my number or verify any silly childhood memories.  Very nice.

Far more exciting things have been going on than dead batteries.  More site updates coming soon.
