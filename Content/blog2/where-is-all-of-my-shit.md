Last night, I was ready to walk the dogs, but I couldn't find my keys.  I looked in all of the normal places that I leave them, and no dice.  So I just grabbed a spare house key and went on my way.
	
I resumed the search this morning at 8:00, or just a little after that.  By 9:15, I had turned over every couch cushion, dumped out every trash can, and slid across all of the floors on my belly, just to look under furniture and fixtures.

The week before last, I found my wallet in the trash can in the study and my keys in the spare bathroom's bathtub in a relatively quick fifteen minutes or so.  Such is life once your baby turns into a toddler.

Stuff ends up everywhere.  Kitchen utensils pile up on the opposite side of the barrier gate.  Just outside of the dog door can be a treasure trove.  One morning, I found a pacifier, a baby monitor, two books, and a remote control.  When I checked there this morning, there was a spatula and a pacifier, but alas, not my keys.

I finally gave Mrs. theskinnyonbenny a call to let her know that they keys were probably lost forever.  This is so she could budget the expense of a full set of replacement keys.  She mentioned that she had last seen them being used as a toy in the study.  Had I looked in the boxes by the door in there?

Of course, my keys were right there.

Now, if I can just find the attachment that allows me to disassemble the juicer for cleaning, we might actually get to drink juice again.
