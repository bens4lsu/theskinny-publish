Here are four things I know about football right now, that I didn't know Saturday morning:
<span class="spanEndPreview">&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><br />
<ul><li>Until this season, LSU had never beaten Florida, Alabama, and Auburn in the same season.  I know that would have been a rare feat, but it seems amazing that it <i>never</i> happened before.<br />
<br />
</li><li>On a similar vein, before now, LSU has never beaten Alabama three years in a row.<br />
<br />
</li><li>When a field goal attempt falls short, a player from the opposing team can catch the ball in the end zone, and return it for a touchdown.  It happened in the Bears game this weekend.  You can also count the fact that the Bears have a home uniform the color of orange sherbet as something I didn't know about football.<br />
<br />
</li><li>Back to LSU, current coach Les Miles and former coach Gary Dinardo were assistants together in Colorado back in the day.  How about that?<br />
<br />
</li><li>Since her costume malfunction at the Super Bowl, Janet Jackson has disappeared from the public eye, so that she could balloon into a great big fatty.</li></ul><br />
<br />
Admittedly, that last one has little to do with football, and I only heard it second hand (and have done nothing to verify it), but I felt like this post needed one more bullet.
