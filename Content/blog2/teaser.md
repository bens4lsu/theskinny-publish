Have you ever come back from a nice dinner to find a friend in the pool out back, naked as a jaybird, and both hands over his head, one holding a rusty machete and the other holding an open bottle of Patron?

Have you?

Don't you wish you vacationed with me?

Don't you wish I blogged more often?
