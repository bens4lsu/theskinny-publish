I can't believe that we actually had a viable presidential candidate this year who denied evolution.  Let's think through the rationale of a guy who wanted to lead the free world.

On one hand, we have the collective knowledge of hundreds of thousands of scientists and thinkers from the last three hundred years.  We have fossil records.  We have mapped DNA, and can determine family lines based on when mutations appear and where they got passed down.
<span class="spanEndPreview">&nbsp;</span>
On the other hand, we have a book.  A five thousand year old book.  And to be honest, it's not very well written.

Look, I have no problem with your belief in God.  It's hard for me to fathom that a trillion little pieces of carbon, hydrogen, and water happened to randomly bump into each other to create something as complicated as a bacteria, much less plants that can create their own food from sunlight, much less a being as amazingly complex as an earthworm, just through random happenings.  But it's time to face a fact:  we weren't all just dropped on this planet in mass, all at once, and unchanged from how we are now.

At one time, it was considered blasphemous to believe that the heavens didn't revolve around the earth.  Or to believe that the earth was round.

And Noah didn't really build an arc with two of every creature while the Earth was swallowed by a great flood.  People have identified something like 900,000 different species of insect alone.  There are over 10,000 species of bird.  How would Noah have kept 20,000 birds from eating 1.8 million bugs?  Does anyone know how Noah supposedly fed all those animals anyway?

The point is that if you want to read the Old Testament as a book of stories to provide you some sort of life guidance, then fine.  If you think it's a book that accurately describes how we all came to be where we are, then you should go get sterilized and take yourself out of the gene pool now.

That way, we humans evolve toward a smarter species.  I know you don't understand, but it's true.
