I don't have much of an embarrassment response.  I can shrug off a lot that should be embarrassing with a "Well, that happens to everyone sometimes," or "Funny way to learn a lesson."  There are a lot of old posts on this blog that are embarrassing to me now, but they weren't really at the time they were posted.  

\(Even though I can be a dick today, I was worse in my 30s.)

Today's post might be the first one I've posted that is embarrassing as I write it.  I'm cringing so hard just knowing what's about to come out of my keyboard.

A couple of weekends ago, we met our friend Trish and her niece down in New Orleans.  We met at Tableau and got a nice balcony seat with great people watching and a front row view of whatever street project is going on right there now.

They did the New Orleans food thing.  I know Trish had the Shrimp and Grits, and we talked about their limited exposure to grids, the poor things.  After the mains, Mrs. theskinnyonbenny suggested the Bananas Foster.  When in Rome, you know.

The Banana Preparer Lady (BPL) came to the door, and we turned our chairs to watch.  The Fire Marshall is apparently less than keen on letting the open flame pfloof (not a typo -- that's my word for it) happen outdoors above unassuming tourists.

I know I must have registered the look of the BPL in my subconcious, but I promist I wasn't conciously making fun of her.  I turned back to the table, and in a voice that was much too loud, I joked, "You can always tell which servers in New Orelans are responsible for preparing the Bananas Foster, because they have the drawn-on eyebrows."

Ko laughed and said, "I can't believe you said that so loud."  I noticed that Trish and the niece had faces that had turned pretty red.

I turned back to BPL, and of course, she had the fakest looking drawn-on eyebrows that you've ever seen.
