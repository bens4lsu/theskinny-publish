I wonder if *Mad Magazine* has done a spoof with Harry Potter with a lot of nose hair, but called him "Hairy Snotter."

Probably like ten years ago.

I just thought of that while in the car with Mrs. theskinnyonbenny yesterday.  I kept it to myself, because I didn't think she would laugh at "Hairy Snotter."
