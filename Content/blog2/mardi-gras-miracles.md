I've noticed that the Gods of Fat Tuesday have been good to us.

<ul><li>Before Muses, my sister Barf bought the kids some crappy light-up wands from those dudes who walk up and down between parades selling crap out of a cart.  To the surprise of no one, they were both were broken within minutes.  But we looked to the kids shortly after that, and both were working again.</li>

<li>Saturday, we went sailing with almost no gas.  We ran out while motoring back home.  But our dock was in sight, and it was downwind!  I let out a little sail, and pointed the bow toward home.  About 400 yards out, we caught a gust and started flying toward the dock at what seemed like 100 mph.  I pulled the tiller in time to turn the bow, grabbed a line that was tied to the dock, and held on for dear life.  In minutes, we were tied up, safe and sound.

(In my mom's version of the story, I had a line in my hand that I lasso'd over the dock piling, cowboy style.  I prefer this version of the story.)</li>

All day in New Orleans on Sunday, and not a drop of rain on us.</li></ul>

More miracles to follow?  I'll let you know.
