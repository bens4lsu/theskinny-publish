Last month, several of us met up in Vegas to celebrate Camilla's 21st birthday.  If you've been a long time reader, you might remember that I was there all the damn time BK (before kids).  But believe it or not, I haven't been out there in almost 15 years.

Mrs. theskinnyonbenny wondered beforehand whether it would be awkward to see Brent again.  Crystal got theskinnyonbenny family in the divorce, and I hadn't seen him in almost as long as I haven't seen Vegas.  I didn't think it would be, and it wasn't.  It felt like we had just hung out in some remote city 6 months ago.

We went hard on the first night, and it was more "just like old times" to wake up in a hotel room that could use an update, whose air-conditioner was just not quite up to the task, and who had no water to drink.  We're boozing, we're on the 24th floor, and we're in the fucking desert.  You just have to provide bottled water.

I had to make a 6:00am choice between putting on clothes or drinking lukewarm tap water in those hotel glasses that probably get washed once a month, whether they need it or not.

Flamingo, I am not a fan.

Lots of people aren't fans of Vegas prices these days.  All of the bars and restaurants are so ridiculously, absurdly expensive that some of the bills made me laugh at the gall.  The $200 bill for 5 drinks at the pool takes the cake.

A couple of the nights out, I wore my silver sequined jacket, and it was a hit out there.

I don't know if this will be funny being written out, but it was funny in life.

mtsob was trying to make spa appointments for all of the ladies.  She got to Brent's partner Margie, who was lovely, and who we met for the first time on this trip.

Spa lady on the phone:  And the next person in your group?

MTSOB:  Her name is Margie.

SL:  I need a full name.

MTSOB:  I've got nothing.  Margie.  Probably Margaret, but I don't know for sure.

Then, she ended up giving _our_ last name, which tickles me to no end.  But at least when Margie decided to pass and I went in her place, one of the names on the reservation was still correct.

There are more funny bits that I'll post if they form up into a story in my mind, but until then, here's a final story from the trip.

One afternoon at the pool, Annika drank enough to be a little wobbly.  She stumbled off to find a bathroom, but then she couldn't find us afterwards.  There were about sixty thousand people in and around the pool, but she thought the lifeguard might be able to help.

"Can you describe your family for me?" he asked.

And she went on to describe our _personalities_.  "They're really annoying, and they might stick an arm in the air and go WOOOO."

We were watching all of this unfold, and Camilla took the reigns of responsibility.  The lifeguard saw her coming, and his face clearly asked, "Is this one yours?" long before she was in range to hear him.

I made a t-shirt design for our next trip.
