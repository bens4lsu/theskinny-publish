Have you noticed that my posts having to do with our big boat delivery trip have a little box at the bottom that says something to the effect of, "this post is mirrored over there at sailvelvetelvis.com in case you want to share the trip, but are otherwise embarrassed about the content of theskinnyonbenny".

This post is going to be why you might be embarrassed.

This is about poop.

If you have any brains, you will close the page now.  I'm serious.

Okay then,

It seems like a year ago, but a couple of months ago, we were tied up in Cartegena, Spain, waiting for yet another 45 knot wind for three days to pass through the god awful Mediterranean in winter.  We wanted to stop in Morocco, and I knew I would need some pet paperwork to be allowed to come with the dog and the cat.

One morning, I walked to the office of a very nice veterinarian.  I ended up getting there about a half hour before the office opened, so I walked a couple of blocks away to get coffee.  

Morning coffee (or evening coffee for that matter) lead me to a fairly urgent call of nature, so I went into the singleton bathroom in the coffee shop.  It had a weird lock with a key, but I figured out how to get it shut, and I jiggled the handle to make sure it didn't rotate.

After finishing my business, I started to wipe.  I had my backside to the door.  I had just spread one cheek with one hand and started to dig the toilet paper deep into my crack with the other, when I heard the door open and a female voice say "Aaaaaaaaaaa!"

It shut before I could stop laughing and apologize for not having the door locked correctly.  When I came out of the bathroom, there was no one to be seen.

In the next town we visited, we started with a breakfast stop.  At the table next to ours was a crazy guy who spread salt all over his table and used it to slide tarot cards around.  He was alone, and you could tell by the staff's interactions that he was a regular.

Karma got me back after my coffee at that shop, when I opeend the bathroom just to come face-to-face with salt guy sitting on the can.  And smiling.

This ended up being the town where we stayed for three weeks, and Ko and I spotted "Salt Guy" over and over while we were there.
