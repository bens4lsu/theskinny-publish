		"post_content" : "Back before the days of blogs and digital images, Mrs theskinnyonbenny and I got married and took a follow-up trip to Ireland.\r\n\r\nWe <a href=\"https:\/\/theskinnyonbenny.com\/blog2\/archives\/113\">toured around for a bit<\/a> and happened to end up in Dublin at the same time that then-president Clinton was in town.\r\n<!--more-->\r\nYou young uns won't remember, but back in the day, <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/The_Troubles\" target=\"_blank\">terrorists would occasionally blow up buildings in Ireland<\/a> in an effort to unite Northern Ireland (which was and is part of the UK) with Ireland.  Clinton was around to get some credit for some treaty having to do with this little spat.  I could probably be less vague if I read the article that I linked there, but I'm not gonna.\r\n\r\nAnyway, more than one Dubliner heard our hillbilly American accents, and naturally asked if we were in town with the presidential delegation.\r\n\r\nThat was annoying, but more annoying was how often the radio played Coolio's Gangsta Paradise.  I would guess that no song has ever been that big a hit in Ireland before or since.  At first it was funny, as I had no notion as a stupid young American that anyone across the pond had even been exposed to hip-hop.  But were they ever exposed.\r\n\r\nThis week, I see headlines pop up about the Inflation Reduction Act (which I know even less about than Irish terrorism), and some of the headlines call it the \"IRA\".  IRA was also the name of the Irish terrorist bomber organization, and thus, I'm reminded of our Ireland trip.\r\n\r\nAnd that, my friends, is why I can't get Gangsta Paradise out of my head this week.\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"\/img\/greenline.gif\" class=\"greenline\" alt=\"{{divider}}\" \/><\/p>\r\n\r\nIn some alternate universe, I started music blogging in 2004 instead of writing about asinine things that I had on my mind back then.  In that universe, I can was on for hours about the genius of some indy band that no one ever heard of, and I have a show on Sirius XMU that airs at 2:00 AM every Sunday.\r\n\r\nIn that universe, I am very poor.\r\n\r\nAt one point last year, I decided that I was going to listen to all of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.rollingstone.com\/music\/music-lists\/best-albums-of-all-time-1062063\/marvin-gaye-whats-going-on-4-1063232\/\">Rolling Stone's top 500 albums of all time<\/a>, and write up a sentence or two about them.  I ended up hating -- and I mean absolutely hating like you hate dead bunny rabbits -- albums number 2 and 3.  \r\n\r\nI know it's my own shortcoming.  There are artists that I adore who talk about those albums inspiring them to make music.  But I made myself listen to them 3 or 4 times each, and it was self-torture.\r\n\r\nAlbum #4 was Stevie Wonder's <i>Songs in they Key of Life<\/i> which I loved so much that I abandoned my project before making it 1% of the way in and listened to Stevie's lifetime of work instead.  And the first time I listened to <i>Songs in the Key of Life<\/i> all the way through, I found out that Gangsta Paradise is just Coolio rapping on top of Stevie's Pastime Paradise.  So maybe that's really the song stuck in my head.\r\n\r\nI swear, sometimes these posts wrap themselves up without me even having to try.\r\n."

It's still good.  I didn't remember much other than the main plot outline, and it had me laughing.\r\n\r\nNot just the big moments -- like when Vinnie came into court wearing the thrift shop suit, but also ones that could go unnoticed if you're playing on your phone while it's on.  In one court scene, the prosecutor mentions \"all our little old ancestors bank in England.\"  As he speaks, the camera panning the jury stops for an extra beat on the face of a black lady who could have had a best supporting nomination just for the look on her face during that 1.5 seconds of screen time.\r\n<!--more-->\r\nHow about instead of <a href=\"https:\/\/variety.com\/2023\/tv\/news\/matlock-reboot-elsbeth-poppas-house-series-cbs-1235607934\/\" target=\"_blank\">rebooting Matlock<\/a>, they back the truck full of money to Joe Peci's and Marisa Tomei's houses and have them revise their characters and solve courtroom crimes somewhere else that they don't fit in?\r\n\r\nI have more TV show pitches, y'all.  \r\n\r\nLucky Hank is very similar to an idea I had about a Mad Men style drama set in the English Department of a huge state university.  My version would have had a lot more political maneuvering and back-stabbing, and I dare say it would have been funnier.  (Topic for another day:  the embarrassingly shitty state of academic buildings at LSU.)\r\n\r\nMy most flushed out idea is for <i>Neighborhood Pool<\/i>, an Office-style mockumentary taking place at a neighborhood pool.  My ideas are exaggerated stories based on real people and events from the Tara pool in Baton Rouge, and the fact that the pool is named after a slave-owning estate from <i>Gone With the Wind<\/i> is just the tip of the iceberg, comedy-wise.\r\n\r\n<a class=\"lightview alignright\" href=\"\/img\/tarapool1.jpg\" data-lightview-caption=\"Tara pool pics from 2015\" data-lightview-group=\"group1\" style=\"width:350px;\"><img src=\"\/img\/tarapool1.jpg\" alt=\"\/img\/tarapool1.jpg\"><br><span class=\"caption\">Tara pool pics from 2015<\/span><\/a>\r\n\r\nI'll piss off someone if I get into too many details, but there are sources that I can mine for comedy that are probably universal when it comes to the neighborhood pool experience:\r\n\r\n<ul><li>The board member committed to an overzealous enforcement of the rules.  Especially as it contrasts to our main-cast group of heavy-drinking parents.<\/li>\r\n<li>Along with that, we have speak-to-the-camera sessions with the kids of the main characters, where they are dismissive of parental involvement and have their own little dramas going on.<\/li> \r\n<li>The tanning people, committed to their hobby in spite of the fact that their skin looks like overcooked sausage.<\/li>\r\n<li>The people who have their own little territory and insist on their own music, so that everyone else hears a mismash of official club music and their tired classic rock playlist.<\/li>\r\n<li>Lifeguards who continuously blow the pool closed in name of lightning, even though there is no threat of bad weather.<\/li>\r\n<li>The angsty teen who brings his guitar to the pool to try to catch a lifeguard's attention<\/li>\r\n<li>Adults who stand in the pool and pound Michelob Ultras all day long, yet never need to use the restroom.<\/li>\r\n<li>The snack bar speaker, which announces whose orders are ready in unintelligible gibberish.  (Unintelligible Gibberish would be a good name for your cover band or your next boat.)<\/li>\r\n<li>In my running plot for season 1, the pool parents find out that one of the dads is going to get divorced.  This leads to all of the tanning ladies -- both married and divorced -- to throw themselves at divorcing dad shamelessly.<\/li><\/ul>\r\n\r\nIf anyone wants to make this when the writers and studios come to terms, I'll be happy to join the writers room.  I haven't even been to the pool as a guest in several years, but the comedy tap is still providing.\r\n\r\n<a class=\"lightview centered\" href=\"\/img\/tarapool2.jpg\" data-lightview-caption=\"tarapool2.jpg\" data-lightview-group=\"group1\"><img src=\"\/img\/tarapool2.jpg\" alt=\"\/img\/tarapool2.jpg\" width=\"450px\"><br><span class=\"caption\"><\/span><\/a>"

A man \"with a firm constitution\" I think they would have said back in the old days.\r\n\r\nThe surprise on my graph is the Animal Flesh segment.  I like the juice running out of my steak to be pink.  A roasting pick looks disgusting (especially the face), but smells so delicious.  The only flesh-like kitchen thing that nauseates me a little is cutting apart a whole chicken.\r\n\r\nThe feel of popping the thighs and the wings out of their joint so that the knife will slide cleanly between the ball and the socket has such a satisfying feel in the fingers, while also making me gag almost every time.\r\n\r\n\r\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/9FHHmx6kDGc\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"\/img\/greenline.gif\" class=\"greenline\" alt=\"{{divider}}\" \/><\/p>\r\n\r\nI boiled crawfish a couple of times this Spring, and I wasn't ever thrilled with the results.  I boiled for the third time this past weekend, and it turns out that not all of the packages of crab boil are created equally.  Zatarain's Pro Boil made for a much better batch of crawfish.  That, plus a 45-minute soak rather than the 20 minutes that the packaging suggests. \r\n\r\n(I write this here so that I can remember the next time that I boil, two years from now.)\r\n\r\nMy most succesful boil was at the first annual crawfish cookoff in support of <a herf=\"https:\/\/www.redstickcares.org\" target=\"_blank\">Red Stick C.A.R.E.S.<\/a>.  The 45-minute soak time was a combination of two things. First, I had the start time wrong in my head and geared up to have them ready an hour earlier than I was supposed to.  And second, when I meant to pull them out, it was pouring rain, so I decided to let them soak some more.\r\n\r\nThe turnout was good.  I can't imagine how good it would have been with the beautiful weather that we've had the rest of this week.  They got BR Music Studio to line up some of their student bands, and those kids were pretty good.  They also brought a whole lot of people that sat there and didn't buy tickets to eat crawfish.\r\n\r\nI don't know what sort of space aliens can sit there smelling crawfish all day and not pony up $20 for an all-you-can-eat wrist band.  Maybe they're all super high on the food disgust chart.\r\n\r\n\r\n<a class=\"lightview centered\" href=\"\/img\/carescrawfish1.jpg\" data-lightview-caption=\"What a team!\" data-lightview-group=\"group1\"><img src=\"\/img\/carescrawfish1.jpg\" alt=\"\/img\/carescrawfish1.jpg\" width=\"650px\"><br><span class=\"caption\">What a team!<\/span><\/a>\r\n\r\n<a class=\"lightview centered\" href=\"\/img\/carescrawfish2.jpg\" data-lightview-caption=\"During the rain delay\" data-lightview-group=\"group1\"><img src=\"\/img\/carescrawfish2.jpg\" alt=\"\/img\/carescrawfish2.jpg\" width=\"650px\"><br><span class=\"caption\">During the rain delay<\/span><\/a>\r\n\r\n<a class=\"lightview centered\" href=\"\/img\/carescrawfish3.jpg\" data-lightview-caption=\"Good turnout\" data-lightview-group=\"group1\"><img src=\"\/img\/carescrawfish3.jpg\" alt=\"\/img\/carescrawfish3.jpg\" width=\"650px\"><br><span class=\"caption\">Good turnout<\/span><\/a>\r\n\r\n<a class=\"lightview centered\" href=\"\/img\/carescrawfish4.jpg\" data-lightview-caption=\"I wish I had gotten a better picture of V in his crawfish costume.\" data-lightview-group=\"group1\"><img src=\"\/img\/carescrawfish4.jpg\" alt=\"\/img\/carescrawfish4.jpg\" width=\"650px\"><br><span class=\"caption\">I wish I had gotten a better picture of V in his crawfish costume.<\/span><\/a>"

She's very close to being in a state as close to full repair as is possible, afer suffering an electrical surge just about a year ago.  V and I motor-sailed her back to her home dock, and for the first time in a while, I really enjoyed being out on the water.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, we dream of new boats.  On top of the disrepair, we'd really like another cabin and another head.  We even went to the boat show in Annapolis back in October to see what features and designs the manufacturers are trotting out there now.\r\n\r\nWe saw some cool boats.  A couple of French manufacturers are turning out 45 ft aluminum hull sailboats with centerboards that make them draw just a foot or two.  Bali catamarans have a garage-door rear wall, so the whole thing can open up and put the main saloon in open-air (at the cost of having a tiny mainsail, and oh my god when that thing starts to leak.  That's how I think about boat features now).\r\n\r\nMrs. theskinnyonbenny also found an <a href=\"https:\/\/pegasus-yachts.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">intriguing boat<\/a> online that wasn't at the show.  We wathced the video tour and talked to one of the owners about some questions that we had.  That turned into an invite to spend a few days aboard one of their boats followed by a visit to their factory in Slovenia.  That sounded fun, and we've been wanting to do a little touring in Eurpoe, so one day after school let out, we were on a plane.\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\r\n<a class=\"lightview centered\" href=\"\/img\/gal\/176%20-%20Eurpoe%202022%20Pt%201%20-%20Slovenia%20Croatia%20Montenegro\/resIMG_20220522_203305_IMG_7983_HEIC.jpg\" data-lightview-caption=\"Pegasus 50 Hull #1\" data-lightview-group=\"group1\"><img src=\"\/img\/gal\/176%20-%20Eurpoe%202022%20Pt%201%20-%20Slovenia%20Croatia%20Montenegro\/resIMG_20220522_203305_IMG_7983_HEIC.jpg\" alt=\"\/img\/gal\/176%20-%20Eurpoe%202022%20Pt%201%20-%20Slovenia%20Croatia%20Montenegro\/resIMG_20220522_203305_IMG_7983_HEIC.jpg\" width=\"650px\"><br><span class=\"caption\">Pegasus 50 Hull #1<\/span><\/a>\r\n\r\n(These, and many many more pictures are <a href=\"https:\/\/theskinnyonbenny.com\/pg4.php?spgmGal=176%20-%20Eurpoe%202022%20Pt%201%20-%20Slovenia%20Croatia%20Montenegro\">over here<\/a>.) \r\n\r\nAfter three planes and a train from Venice to Triste (Italy), a car was supposed to meet us to bring us the rest of the way to Izola, Slovenia.  It didn't show.  We \"wasted\" some time in a sleepy Italian town, drinking a couple of beers and watching music videos before the bartender helped us find a cab that would take a credit card (as we had not gotten any Euro-cash yet.  I'm pretty sure they all call it Euro-cash.)\r\n\r\nWe got let off at the marina in Izola, and still had to hike for what felt like three hours to circle around the boats and find the vessel where we were supposed to stay.  They had it open, nice and clean, and a chilled local wine and some farmer's market fruit at the ready for us.  Two of the owners of the company came by an hour or so later, and we had a good time swapping sailing stories and talking boats, despite how tired we were.\r\n\r\nBy then, it was getting on toward 9:00 PM on Sunday night, and finding an open restaurant proved to be a challenge.  We wandered into a bar full of guys who didn't speak English and took a little while to figure out that there was no food there.  But one of the guys was super nice, and he walked us out of the building and pointed us to the only nearby local restaurant.  Dinner and drinks were great, and we got our first sign that prices in Slovenia are great.\r\n\r\nThe next two days, we put the boat through its paces.  She sailed great -- having a correctly-shaped mainsail with full battens really helps I think (Velvet Elvis has a main that furls into the mast.  It's convenient, but the poor sail shape has lead most of the boat-makers to abandon the design.)  We had a lot of light wind, and she still moved.  It's probably a better boat test -- in 17 kts, they're all going to move pretty well.\r\n\r\nThe Northern Adriatic is beautiful.  It has deep blue water, and the ocean is rimmed by rolling hills.  The Slovenia coast line is small enough that we were able to lay eyes on both Italy and Croatia in a couple of short day sails.\r\n\r\nExploring Izola was fun too.  It's a small seaside down, wrapping around a huge marina.  Streets are clean and full of flowers, and the town is full of young people and families.  Although it was our Summer, their kids were still in school, so there was a definite rhythm to the days.  We mostly sat at outdoor cafes, and we kept the boat stocked with wines, fruit and cheese.  \r\n\r\nAt lunch one day, the waiter came by after a long wait, and V wasn't ready to order.  \r\n\r\n\"What the heck?\" asked his mother.\r\n\r\n\"I was staring at the wall,\" he replied.\r\n\r\n\"Huh?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's a really nice wall.\"\r\n\r\nI turned, and indeed, it was a nice wall.\r\n\r\n<a class=\"lightview centered\" href=\"\/img\/gal\/176%20-%20Eurpoe%202022%20Pt%201%20-%20Slovenia%20Croatia%20Montenegro\/resIMG_20220523_152653_IMG_8002_HEIC.jpg\" data-lightview-caption=\"A nice wall\" data-lightview-group=\"group1\"><img src=\"\/img\/gal\/176%20-%20Eurpoe%202022%20Pt%201%20-%20Slovenia%20Croatia%20Montenegro\/resIMG_20220523_152653_IMG_8002_HEIC.jpg\" alt=\"\/img\/gal\/176%20-%20Eurpoe%202022%20Pt%201%20-%20Slovenia%20Croatia%20Montenegro\/resIMG_20220523_152653_IMG_8002_HEIC.jpg\" width=\"650px\"><br><span class=\"caption\">A nice wall<\/span><\/a>\r\n\r\nAfter some sailing days, we took the bus to Ljubljana so that we could tour the factory where the boats get made.  Like all bus routes everywhere, it took a roundabout way through rural towns.  It was really pretty, but took an hour longer than it should have.  We were shown great hospitality by our hosts, and examining the boats in various stages of construction was pretty cool.  They brought us to a local place that served us all kinds of game (bear, goat duck) prepared deliciously, along with lots of local wines.  I think we spent at least a couple of hours as course after course of meats came out.\r\n\r\nOur planned bus out of town was full, so we ended up wandering around downtown Ljubljana.  I'm so glad we did.  It's an energetic, lively place with lots of beautiful buildings and a river running through it, which is always a nice touch.\r\n\r\nAfter a night in Ljubljana, we decided to rent a car and move on to being tourists in Croatia.  \r\n\r\nThe drive to Dubrovnik took most of the rest of the day.  An interesting thing is that you drive a long way through Croatia, then have to pass through Bosnia and Herzegovina, and then back into Croatia again.  These countries aren't part of the Schengen treaty, which is the one that lets you pass country to country without having to do the whole border crossing dance.  So that day, we had to border cross into Croatia, border cross into Bosnia and Herzegovina, and then border cross back into Croatia.  That significantly increases the travel time.\r\n\r\nWe got to the gates of Old Dubrovnik just before sunset.  Old Dubrovnik is the walled city with narrow alleys between blocks of buildings.  It's the part of town that's thousands of years old.  I appreciate that the streets are marble stone.  I'll go out on a limb and declare that t's impossible for your city to look like a shit hole when you have marble streets.\r\n\r\nWe spent a few days there, doing the tourist things -- wandering around and drinking wine, mostly.  The tour of the city from the walls that loom up above is exhausting but worth the effort.  It rewards you with views of the town and views out over the blue, blue sea.  \r\n\r\n<a class=\"lightview centered\" href=\"\/img\/gal\/176%20-%20Eurpoe%202022%20Pt%201%20-%20Slovenia%20Croatia%20Montenegro\/resIMG_20220527_172720_IMG_8109_HEIC.jpg\" data-lightview-caption=\"Paddling Dubrovnik\" data-lightview-group=\"group1\"><img src=\"\/img\/gal\/176%20-%20Eurpoe%202022%20Pt%201%20-%20Slovenia%20Croatia%20Montenegro\/resIMG_20220527_172720_IMG_8109_HEIC.jpg\" alt=\"\/img\/gal\/176%20-%20Eurpoe%202022%20Pt%201%20-%20Slovenia%20Croatia%20Montenegro\/resIMG_20220527_172720_IMG_8109_HEIC.jpg\" width=\"650px\"><br><span class=\"caption\">Paddling Dubrovnik<\/span><\/a>\r\n\r\nJust over a couple of large hills from Dubrovnik is another border crossing -- this one into Montenegro.  We booked a room over a weekend in another walled, ancient city -- this one Kotor.\r\n\r\nWe spent a weekend in Kotor, which to me, is like a rock-and-roll version of Dubrovnik.  It's less crowded, less gleaming, and less touristy, but it was still a really cool place to visit.  One thing that stands out is the massive number of stray cats.  It's really the only place we visited with lots of stray animals.  The cats added some personality to the place.  We didn't see any that looked mangy or unhealthy.  \r\n\r\n<a class=\"lightview centered\" href=\"\/img\/gal\/176%20-%20Eurpoe%202022%20Pt%201%20-%20Slovenia%20Croatia%20Montenegro\/resIMG_20220528_174637_IMG_8186_HEIC.jpg\" data-lightview-caption=\"The kids play in Kotor\" data-lightview-group=\"group1\"><img src=\"\/img\/gal\/176%20-%20Eurpoe%202022%20Pt%201%20-%20Slovenia%20Croatia%20Montenegro\/resIMG_20220528_174637_IMG_8186_HEIC.jpg\" alt=\"\/img\/gal\/176%20-%20Eurpoe%202022%20Pt%201%20-%20Slovenia%20Croatia%20Montenegro\/resIMG_20220528_174637_IMG_8186_HEIC.jpg\" width=\"650px\"><br><span class=\"caption\">The kids play in Kotor<\/span><\/a>\r\n\r\nTake a look at <a href=\"https:\/\/theskinnyonbenny.com\/pg4.php?spgmGal=176%20-%20Eurpoe%202022%20Pt%201%20-%20Slovenia%20Croatia%20Montenegro\"> all the picutres I've posted for this leg of the trip<\/a>.

I was to get up at first light and head out.\r\n\r\nThe weather was a long way from ideal.  It was blowing 25 knots, straight from the direction we would be trying to travel.  In fact, it had pushed so much water from the Gulf up into Lake Pontchartrain that we had to wade out to the boat in water that fluctated between shin-deep and waist-deep while walking on the deck out to the boat.\r\n\r\nOn our departure date, I started the motor, got the lines off of the dock, and started to back off.  As soon as the dock was out of reach, the motor died.  I tried a few times to restart it, and then I screamed for help.\r\n\r\nThat monster wind was blowing us backwards, straight down the canal, and we were getting faster and faster.  A crash into someone else's dock was imminent.  Mrs. theskinnyonbenny called for the anchor (which was brilliant), and we got it down in time to stop our inevitable wreck.\r\n\r\nI still couldn't get the motor to restart, so we hit #1 on boat speed-dial, Sea Tow.  They sent a guy who was helpful, but he didn't think that with the wind gusts, he could move us around safely.  We sent him on his way.\r\n\r\nI spent some time troubleshooting and found that the deisel didn't smell like deisel.  We had a ton of water in there.  I won't get too technical, but there's a fuel\/water separator in there.  I spent an hour or so pumping fuel in there, skimming the water, and repeating until we were seeing actual deisel in there.  After that, the motor started right up.\r\n\r\nAfteer that, we decided to wait for a little bit better weather to shove off again.  Two days later, we took off without incident.\r\n\r\nOn our first day out, the wind was better, but still pretty string, and still right on our bow.  Once we got to Mississippi, we stayed inside the barrier islands, but we were still crashing into waves steadily under motor all day.  The wind and waves settled down as it started to get dark, and that's when we noticed another problem.\r\n\r\n<a class=\"lightview centered\" href=\"\/img\/gal\/171%20-%20Summer%202021%20Pt%201%20-%20Getting%20to%20the%20Exumas\/resIMG_20210522_155053_IMG_1801.jpg\" data-lightview-caption=\"On Mississippi Sound\" data-lightview-group=\"group1\"><img src=\"\/img\/gal\/171%20-%20Summer%202021%20Pt%201%20-%20Getting%20to%20the%20Exumas\/resIMG_20210522_155053_IMG_1801.jpg\" alt=\"\/img\/gal\/171%20-%20Summer%202021%20Pt%201%20-%20Getting%20to%20the%20Exumas\/resIMG_20210522_155053_IMG_1801.jpg\" width=\"650px\"><br><span class=\"caption\">On Mississippi Sound<\/span><\/a>\r\n\r\nOur AIS (a dandy little piece of electronics that draws the position of other boats while we're out underway) had been giving us problems.  Other boats were seeing us on their screens, but our screen didn't show any of them.  I turned on the radar so that they would show up as purple blobs, at least, and it wasn't working either.  We also had one light out.  That's a whole lot of the things we have on board to make sure we don't bump into big giant ships in the middle of the night.\r\n\r\nA nighttime passage across the Mobile Bay shipping channel is stressful enough under normal circumstances.  From a distance, it's hard to tell a rig from a ship.  At about 2:00 AM, I was thinking, \"They shouldn't be allowed to put a red light on a rig like that.  People will think it's the port side of a ship,\" and just then, the \"rig\" radioed me to to ask me to pass to his stern as he entered the Bay from the Gulf.  Oops.\r\n\r\nOne night of that was enough, so we put in to Pensacola for repairs.  I found a super-competent guy who was able to get a new AIS and a new radar shipped overnight, and got them installed.  But as he worked, other electronic components started dying.  He diagnosed a lightning strike, and told us that stuff would be failing one by one all Summer long.  It was a dark time.\r\n\r\nMemorial Day weekend was on us, so we went to a nice little anchorage near the mouth of Pensacola Bay.  We had anchored there a time or two before, and usually shared it with a few other boats, some fishemen, and a dolphin or two.  On Memorial Day weekend, it was boat tied to boat tied to boat from one shore to the other.  Take a meth lab, the shittest modern country music artist, a beach resort, and roll it into one, then multiply that by a thousand.  That's what was there.\r\n\r\nWe went up the sound towards Orange Beach, maybe a mile or so, and we had nice spots to kayak, swim, and dinghy for the weekend.  A couple of dolphiins popped up near our dinghy, and Rosie decided, \"fuck it, I'm chasing them\" and dove into the water swimming for her water-bound playmates.  We found a pretty good taco truck one night.  It was a decent weekend.\r\n\r\n<a class=\"lightview centered\" href=\"\/img\/gal\/171%20-%20Summer%202021%20Pt%201%20-%20Getting%20to%20the%20Exumas\/resIMG_20210530_150250_IMG_6772.jpg\" data-lightview-caption=\"Memorial Day Weekend - Dinner on the hook\" data-lightview-group=\"group1\"><img src=\"\/img\/gal\/171%20-%20Summer%202021%20Pt%201%20-%20Getting%20to%20the%20Exumas\/resIMG_20210530_150250_IMG_6772.jpg\" alt=\"\/img\/gal\/171%20-%20Summer%202021%20Pt%201%20-%20Getting%20to%20the%20Exumas\/resIMG_20210530_150250_IMG_6772.jpg\" width=\"650px\"><br><span class=\"caption\">Memorial Day Weekend - Dinner on the hook<\/span><\/a>\r\n\r\nAfter that, the electronics guys were tearing apart our boat to replace things for a week.  The cat and I stayed on board, while the rest of the family took a rental car and headed home.  Liveaboard life by oneself on a boat where all of the panels are pulled off isn't fun.  I had a bike and a dinghy to use for food runs, but not much close.  I pretty well wiped out our summer's supply of hot dogs.  It was a week of hot dogs, watching baseball on an ipad, and getting a lot of work done.  \r\n\r\nWe finally got out of Pensacola June 11.  Most of our stuff was working, but we were prepared for stuff to be failing.  The plug for shore power air conditioning hadn't been replaced and was unusable, but we don't spend that much time in a marina anyway.  The sail to Key West was more or less uneventful, and once there, we resupplied, visited some of our favorite hangouts, and tried to avoid the Covid-laden crowds.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of Covid, we had to get V a test to get in to the Bahamas.  Mrs. theskinnyonbenny and I were vaccinated and K was under the age where they care.  A very nice medical professional came out to our boat, stuck the swab up his nose, and disappeared.  Results to follow by email.  We rolled the dice and headed out.  While still in sight of Key West, a monster squall blew through and tossed us all over the place for an hour or so.  That was no fun.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the passage was fine.  A couple of days and nights later, we were close enough to some Bahamian islands to unbox our hotspot and check the internet.  The hotspot was an ancient piece of equipment whose screen showed something like 3TB of use up to that point.  It was working okay, but if you put down your device to do something else for a bit, you had to power the hotspot off and back on for it to connect again.  Not ideal.\r\n\r\n<a class=\"lightview centered\" href=\"\/img\/gal\/171%20-%20Summer%202021%20Pt%201%20-%20Getting%20to%20the%20Exumas\/resIMG_20210615_172358_IMG_6794.jpg\" data-lightview-caption=\"Resupply run in Key West.

This is my favorite pic from the trip.<\/span><\/a>\r\n\r\nSomewhere in here, I also had an incident where a stream of salt water spray came right through a hatch in calm seas, landing right on my computer keyboard.  The computer was toast.\r\n\r\nOn June 18, we pulled in to a marina in Nassau to clear in.  We had V's covid clearance, and all of the paperwork was fine.  I decided to fill the water tanks while the rest of the family moved booze and gear to a charter boat that our friends would be picking up later that same evening.  The waater ran and ran and ran.  It was taking forever.  I blamed Bahamian water pressure, but still, it had only been a few days since we filled up in Key West.  After forever, I pulled up some floor boards and saw that the water was running from our aft tank straight into the bilge.  We were just filling fresh water and just as fast, the bilge pump was pumping it overboard.  For the rest of the trip, a high water alarm would occasionally go off because of leaking water from that tank (later identified as a host to be replaced).  The alarm shrieked an ungodly, inescapable scream, which is good for a high water alarm on a boat, but still....\r\n\r\nAfter a full day sail to Highborne Cay, I tried moving the SIM card from the Bahamas hotspot to a different hotspot that we keep on board.  Didn't work.  I moved it back to the ancient hotspot and now it didn't work either.  Without data, we were going to be pretty screwed.  We went to bed frustrated, and pretty much assuming that our summer trip was entirely fucked.\r\n\r\n<a class=\"lightview centered\" href=\"\/img\/gal\/171%20-%20Summer%202021%20Pt%201%20-%20Getting%20to%20the%20Exumas\/resIMG_20210618_201634_IMG_2024.jpg\" data-lightview-caption=\"Finally there.\" data-lightview-group=\"group1\"><img src=\"\/img\/gal\/171%20-%20Summer%202021%20Pt%201%20-%20Getting%20to%20the%20Exumas\/resIMG_20210618_201634_IMG_2024.jpg\" alt=\"\/img\/gal\/171%20-%20Summer%202021%20Pt%201%20-%20Getting%20to%20the%20Exumas\/resIMG_20210618_201634_IMG_2024.jpg\" width=\"650px\"><br><span class=\"caption\">Finally there.<\/span><\/a>\r\n\r\nI woke early the next morning and made a last ditch effort with the SIM card.  I had forgotten about my work hotspot that I keep in my computer bag.  What do you know, it worked!  Summer was unfucked!\r\n\r\nThis gave us a chance to appreciate that we were in clear blue water, under sunny skies with a cool breeze.  There were starfish, rays, and an island bar (where they were kind of rude and super expensive, but on this trip, we weren't going to get it all.  In fact, this starts a stretch of summer that was only maybe 20% bad.  Let's pick up there next time.\r\n\r\nA bunch more pics from this leg of the trip are posted <a href=\"https:\/\/theskinnyonbenny.com\/pg4.php?spgmGal=171%20-%20Summer%202021%20Pt%201%20-%20Getting%20to%20the%20Exumas\">over here<\/a>.\r\n"

I end up in this weird place where I tell myself, \"I can't post about Y because I haven't even gotten around to writing about X, and it ends up where I don't post at all.\"  That's as dumb as you're thinking it is, so I'm just going to start posting some things here and there.  It won't chronicle life sequentially, but who cares?\r\n\r\nThis Summer, we sailed again to the Bahamas.  While we were there, we enjoyed beautiful days, floating above crystal clear water, with cool breezes perfect for sailing and ventilation blowing night and day.  But as good as the good stuff was, we'll also remember all of the fiascos.  I'll probably circle back and try to detail the broken boat equipment, salt-ruined electronics, and travel snafus, but it will be more fun to document other people's misfortune first.\r\n<!--more-->\r\n<a class=\"lightview centered\" href=\"\/img\/IMG_20210626_164008_IMG_6862.jpg\" data-lightview-caption=\"Hard not to miss the Bahamas when you go through the pictures.\" data-lightview-group=\"group1\"><img src=\"\/img\/IMG_20210626_164008_IMG_6862.jpg\" alt=\"\/img\/IMG_20210626_164008_IMG_6862.jpg\" width=\"650px\"><br><span class=\"caption\">Hard not to miss the Bahamas when you go through the pictures.<\/span><\/a>\r\n\r\nOur friends Crystal and Robert were due to meet us in mid-July, right before we turned toward home.  The morning they were supposed to fly out, I got a call while still in bed.  Robert had been denied travel, because he ordered a \"passport card\" instead of a passport.  It's a little cheaper, and as far as I can tell, it will get you on a cruise ship, but that's about it.  I really don't know why they offer such a thing.  It must cause problems all the time.\r\n\r\nThey were ready to cancel, but after spending all day looking for a new plan, we found a ferry from Fort Lauderdale that could get them in.  (The cards are good for boats.)  So they drove all night to Fort Lauderdale and were on the boat the next morning.\r\n\r\nThey arrived in Bimini, went to clear in to the country, and they were turned away.  It turns out that Crystal wasn't in a place yet where she trusted the vaccine that has been in the works for 20 years, and her negative Covid test was about 5 minutes older than Bahamian customs would allow.  Back on the ferry they went, for the return cruise to Florida.\r\n\r\nBut all was not lost.  Robert knew someone who knew someone who worked for a US Congressman, and this samaritan got him an appointment at the Miami passport office.  So they booked new plane tickets, scheduled a new Covid test, and started the next morning at their appointment.\r\n\r\nIt turns out that the appointment was just an appointment to stand in line.  For five and a half hours.  If I remember correctly, you can't even bring your phone into a federal building, so they stood in line for all of those hours with nothing to entertain them other than the back of the head for the person in front of them.\r\n\r\nOn day four of their week-long vacation, they finally boarded the plane that would get them to the Bahamas.\r\n\r\nI'm tempted to describe the days we had as packed.  We did force activities into every daylight moment and plenty of the nights as well.  But at least a few of those days looked like this.\r\n\r\n<a class=\"lightview centered\" href=\"\/img\/IMG_20210717_134041_S0354044_JPG.jpg\" data-lightview-caption=\"A lot of this.\" data-lightview-group=\"group1\"><img src=\"\/img\/IMG_20210717_134041_S0354044_JPG.jpg\" alt=\"\/img\/IMG_20210717_134041_S0354044_JPG.jpg\" width=\"650px\"><br><span class=\"caption\">A lot of this.<\/span><\/a>\r\n\r\nWe swam with the famous pigs, and I don't remember from our previous trips that they just shit constantly.  These are some really photogenic pigs, but people go through great pains to get photos that don't include pig excrement of some variety or other.  The fastest I moved the entire summer was a mad scramble, 10 yards away from a pig's behind, to jump into the dinghy and get away from a floating cloud of nastiness.\r\n\r\nWe had the grotto to ourselves, free of big boats full of tourists, which was amazing.  We took side trips to Little Farmer's Cay and to Black Point, which was late in the day, and where I believe at least one of us was too drunk to remember.  No shame there -- we came to play.\r\n\r\nVanya took up some time during the week getting himself invited to visit and eat with people on big giant yachts.  One night, he had free lobster curry on board, while we ate $18 hambergers 50 yards away inside the yacht club.\r\n\r\nThey ended up being able to extend their trip by a couple of days, so all we really missed out on was rest.  But there's plenty of time left for that when we're dead.  Or when you have a 13 hour drive back home from Fort Lauderdale to end your vacation.\r\n\r\nAfter we returned, Crystal's mom made a suggestion that I ran with as soon as I heard it.  We now have this trophy to pass back and forth after each time we meet up, assuming someone does something dumb enough to deserve it.  (Someone always does something dumb enough to deserve it.)  \r\n\r\n<a class=\"lightview centered\" href=\"\/img\/donkey1.png\" data-lightview-caption=\"\" data-lightview-group=\"group1\"><img src=\"\/img\/donkey1.png\" alt=\"\/img\/donkey1.png\" width=\"650px\"><br><span class=\"caption\"><\/span><\/a>\r\n\r\n<a class=\"lightview centered\" href=\"\/img\/donkey2.png\" data-lightview-caption=\"\" data-lightview-group=\"group1\"><img src=\"\/img\/donkey2.png\" alt=\"\/img\/donkey2.png\" width=\"650px\"><br><span class=\"caption\"><\/span><\/a>"

The writing was on the wall for the shitshow that Florida would become.  And the first hurricane of the year spun up between here and Mexico.  A long sailing trip wasn't in the cards.\r\n\r\nWe had done some early planning of a road trip across the Alaskan Highway, but in ignorance about its own name, the highway crosses Canada, who was equally inhospitable.\r\n<!--more-->\r\nWe bought the coolest little camping trailer and headed to the nearest mountains (Arkansas, it turns out).  I had planned to be diligent about blooging our travels, but a mishap at the end of our first week left me not in the mood to write.\r\n\r\nSome people put catsup on their eggs.  Some people remove their shirts to poop.  We took a cat on a cross country camping trip.\r\n<a class=\"lightview alignright\" href=\"\/img\/IMG_6403.jpeg\" data-lightview-caption=\"Maks watches another camper pitch his tent at one of the early stops on our trip.\" data-lightview-group=\"group1\" style=\"width:350px;\"><img src=\"\/img\/maks-camping-1.jpg\" alt=\"\/img\/IMG_6403.jpeg\" width=\"350px\"><br><span class=\"caption\">Maks watches another camper pitch his tent at one of the early stops on our trip.<\/span><\/a>\r\nHere's my defence:  Maks isn't a normal cat.  He's mostly like a dog.  He (often) comes when you call, he doesn't wander off on a male cat quest to get laid, and he's pretty damned loyal to the refilling of his food bowl.  He likes strangers just fine, and likes his family quite a lot.  Sometimes, he even comes along when I walk the dog, trotting unleashed beside us.\r\n\r\nFor the first three or four stops, it played out like I had expected.  Maks might disappear into the woods for a bit, but then he'd come back and hang with us.  At night, he joined us in the camper.  He was never out of sight for more than an hour or two.\r\n\r\nThen, at a pretty little camp site by the White River in Northern Arkansas, he failed to return.  We waited several hours, and then several days.  We walked around calling him incessantly.  We offered campground kids lucrative rewards.  The whole campground was on lookout.\r\n\r\nAfter a week, it was hard to imagine any scenario other than him slipping into the luggage compartment in the belly of an RV that was on its way out.  We waited for the phone call from some nearby town, or Tennessee, or Vermont.  Who knows?  We left Arkansas and worked our way West without a word.  I'll write about so many of the places we visited, but for the purpose of this post, just know that we saw places that I've heard about my whole life, along with several spots that I should have heard about, also along with a few great camping spots that I think people are keeping secret on purpose.  All of this an no phone call.\r\n<a class=\"lightview alignright\" href=\"\/img\/maks-camping-2.jpg\" data-lightview-caption=\"In the back seat, you find room where you can on the last leg home.\" data-lightview-group=\"group1\" style=\"width:350px;\"><img src=\"\/img\/maks-camping-2.jpg\" alt=\"\/img\/maks-camping-2.jpg\" width=\"350px\"><br><span class=\"caption\">In the back seat, you find room where you can on the last leg home.<\/span><\/a>\r\nUntil a day, five or six weeks later.  We were in a desert in South-Central California.  The phone rang, and Maks was hanging around in the campground where we had last seen him.  At that point, we were closer to the moon than we were to Arkansas, but we started the longest, hottest, most boring drive that you can devise across these United States.  It's a blur of red dirt and scrub brush, and not one of those Bugs Bunny cacti with the two upward pointed arms.  We stopped twice to sleep, but both stops were short.  I'll turn 50 next year without having seen the Grand Canyon.\r\n\r\n(Now that I think about it, I did see it from the window of a flight in to Vegas once.  Does that count?)\r\n\r\nSome nice people met us in a small town WalMart parking lot, and just as suddenly as he had disappeard, Maks was home.  He had to have been so surprised to come out of the carrier and find himself face to face with the people he had probably written off as lost.  Rosie gave him the excited dog reunion greeting that dog owners get when they get home from work every day.  Ko's level of excitement excited me.  Vanya's lack of excitement surprised me, but he explained that he never thought that Maks <i>wouldn't<\/i> be back, so it was just an expected part of the trip to him.\r\n\r\nMaks has settled back into his normal routine, which is pretty much just walking around meowing at people to feed him or pet him.  He keeps close enough to see or hear someone in the family.  One morning this week, he joined the dog and me on our morning walk. \r\n"

Our neighbors have come to join us for the only morning of the year where we have no traffic.\r\n\r\nThe later in the race you get, the more social the racers, so towards the end, we end up sharing beer and champagne.

I was all strapped in and ready to be pulled to the top of the mast, when I felt a pop.  My weight went back to my feet which were back on deck.  A few seconds later, the halyard I was going up on floated down onto my head.  No joke here.  Fortunately, the line broke while I was an inch off the ground.  A few minutes later, I would have been falling from the height of a two-story building.

V swam in the early session, and K in the afternoon, which meant that I was in the nautitorium for about 7 or 8 hours, when you figure in warm-ups etc.  I didn't see a soul that I knew there.  I managed to listen to some decent tunes, and read a little bit of a decent book, but mostly, it was watching kids swim.\r\n\r\nThe morning session warmups included about 300 kids by my rough calculation.  Each of three pools was full to kid-density that you see here. (There's one more pool to my left, and another one under the diving boards at the other end.)  Then, there were two shifts, each as crowded as the other.  That's a lot of swimming kids.\r\n\r\nWhile waiting for K's second race. he flipped through my phone pics, and found this one.  Apparently, we released a genie on New Year's Eve.  \r\n\r\nThere's no image processing going on here.  It's just a smoke bomb going off under the blue-tinted light over the bar.

I've managed a few, but there's an almost constant cclomp of kids mvoing in and out.  Practice times are staggered between the different groups of kids. and it takes a while between the time I get there and the time when things calm down.  \r\n<!--more-->\r\n<a class=\"lightview alignright\" href=\"\/img\/waitingatswim.jpg\" data-lightview-caption=\"\" data-lightview-group=\"group1\"><img src=\"\/img\/waitingatswim.jpg\" alt=\"\/img\/waitingatswim.jpg\" width=\"270px\"><br><span class=\"caption\">This is where I blog now.<\/span><\/a>\r\n\r\nThere are daily reunions of kids that go to different schools, all with news to share.  There's the steady vibration dropping bags, pulling off shoes, kicking shoes back on to wet feet.  On dry workout days, there are more interludes for hurried stripping of outerwear and then rushing back to swim lanes.  It's even hard to sit and read, much less try to fall asleep.\r\n\r\nAudiobooks work okay, but what I really like to do is to make up names and stories about the kids and parents that I see coming and going.  And if I'm really being honest, I'm not creative enough to make up stories -- I just mentally file them into the tropes from John Hughs movies. \r\n\r\nThere's one young kid, waiting for an even younger sister, who is never without his small, purple LSU football.  I want to ask him to throw it around, but he's been taught not to talk to strangers, and I'm too worried about seeming like a weirdo, so we both just sit, bored and quiet.\r\n\r\nBy 5:45 or so, eveyone who is swimming is usually at their practice, leaving four or five parents plus a couple of siblings spread out in the bleachers.  You can start to hear the echoey pop music playing through the natatorium speakers, probabbly from one of the coach's phones.  I wonder if I could catch a quick nap.\r\n"

And I'm here to share my wisdom.\r\n\r\n*(I hear some of you saying that LSU played for a title after the 2011 season too.  I remember the SEC title game that year, but I don't believe they played again after that.)\r\n\r\nAfter the 2003 season, a friend of ours went out and bought a brand-new huge-ass TV.  Unfortunately, he didn't bother to upgrade his cable plan to include the HD channels, and I didn't think that anyone was still watching low-def football.  So I only got to see a giant blurry representation of the game.  That's lesson number one.  Make sure you know where you're watching.\r\n<!--more-->\r\n<a class=\"lightview centered\" href=\"\/img\/championship-night-early.jpg\" data-lightview-caption=\"Ready for the game to start on Monday night.\" data-lightview-group=\"group1\"><img src=\"\/img\/championship-night-early.jpg\" alt=\"\/img\/championship-night-early.jpg\" width=\"650px\"><br><span class=\"caption\">Ready for the game to start on Monday night.<\/span><\/a>\r\nFor the championship after the 2007 season, we went down to New Orleans to be in the mix.  Not to go to the game -- just to be near the game.  V was just a tiny little toddler, and we navigated the French Quarter with him on my shoulders.  \r\n\r\nAfter an hour or so, we were headed into Napolean House for a round of cocktails when a stranger ran up saying, \"Man!  You can't let your kid wear these!\"\r\n\r\nI set V down and saw that someone had given him a strand of penis beads.  For those of you now acquainted with New Orleans, that's not some weird sex thing -- it's just a strand of beads that has plastic genitalia where the round things normally are.  V had placed the beads over his head and worn them around while riding on my shoulders.  It's anyone's guess as to how long he was up there like that.  I would love to be able to read the minds of the few people who saw him and were aghast.\r\n\r\nOne Mardi Gras not too long after that, he was on my shoulders when a religious nutjob started yelling to me about being a sinner.  \"He's going to grow up to be a fornicator, if you don't get him out of New Orleans!\" he shouted.\r\n\r\n\"I should hope so.  Why wouldn't I want my grown son to have a happy sex life,\" I replied.  This lead to much laughter from the poor saps who were just trying to watch their parade in sin-loving peace.\r\n\r\nSo maybe lesson two is that you shouldn't bring toddlers to the French Quarter.  But to be honest, the penis beads were funny, so if you can avoid the zealots, I think the French Quater and toddlers mix just fine.\r\n\r\nWhen the Saints made the Super Bowl, we headed back to the French Quarter again, this time without children.  (In fact, it was V's birthday, but we just lied and told him that his birthday was the following weekend.  Little kids believe anything.)\r\n\r\nWe pretty much had the championship day thing down by then.  It was a nearly perfect day.  We had good drinks.  We ran into friends.  We ended up with a good screen where we could watch the game.  When the game was over, the whole bar spilled out into Burbon Street and I hugged and danced with strangers for quite a while.  After that, Mrs. theskinnyonbenny was still with me, but our friends were hopeless lost in the huge crowd.  Mrs. theskinnyonbenny and I went to Daisy Duke's for chili-cheese omelets, and even as I type this a decade later, my stomach turns when I think about it.\r\n\r\nRule number three:  NEVER eat at Daisy Duke's.\r\n\r\nRule number four:  Getting drunk is fine, but you want to be able to remember at least some of the plays in the second half when you wake up the next day.\r\n\r\nThat brings us to Monday.  Shelly came down, and we got a good seat in front of a million sharp TVs two hours before game time.  Drinks flowed, but in my case, it was mostly beer, and I remember every second of it.  The shots at the end of the night were probably a bad idea, but I didn't hang over on Tuesday, so they're allowed.  \r\n\r\n<a class=\"lightview centered\" href=\"\/img\/championship-night.png\" data-lightview-caption=\"championship-night.png\" data-lightview-group=\"group1\"><img src=\"\/img\/championship-night.png\" alt=\"\/img\/championship-night.png\" width=\"650px\"><br><span class=\"caption\"><\/span><\/a>\r\n\r\nOkay, so I got naked in the kitchen.\r\n\r\nThat part was fun.  The part that wasn't was when Shelly sent me her pictures the next morning.  I'm still really pretty, but I'm almost 50, have a big belly, and still have no ass at all.  My naked is fun, but it's also funny looking.\r\n\r\nRule number five:  make your friends put away their phones when you get naked.\r\n"

Who's the best artist that everyone likes?\r\n\r\n(Nothing and no one, to be honest, but here's what I've come up with as the best potential answers.)\r\n\r\n<strong>Billy Joel:<\/strong>  This is thex first answer that popped into my head, and perhaps still the best.\r\n\r\n<strong>Dave Matthews Band:<\/strong>  In their heyday, I was put off of DMB by a super irritating coworker who was super enthusiastic about DMB.  Her constant prattling made me want to hate DMB, and I'm only just now getting past that.\r\n\r\n<strong>Tina Turner:<\/strong>  Maybe my personal favorite, but not as univerally beloved as she should be.\r\n\r\n<strong>Coldplay:<\/strong>  Radiohead without the unusualness, maybe?  But along with the interesting sounds go the...  well, the interesting sounds.  Not sure if they belong here or not.\r\n\r\n<strong>Johnny Cash:<\/strong>  Popped into my head late, but I think the man in black is a good addition.  \r\n\r\n<strong>Avett Brothers:<\/strong>  Potential winner here, but can you really say that everyone likes a band that unashamedly includes cellos in many tracks?  I think you can, but I understand if you want to quibble.\r\n\r\n<strong>Hall and Oats, Huey Lewis and the News, Loverboy:<\/strong>  80s hit machines, but we're looking for the best, and none of them are better than Billy Joel.\r\n\r\n<strong>Cage the Elephant, Kings of Leon, The Kooks:<\/strong>  All super good, and I don't know anyone who dislikes them.  I know a lot of old people who have never heard of any of these bands though.\r\n\r\n<strong>The Killers:<\/strong>  Just thought of this as I was finishing up.  Might be the winner.\r\n\r\nGive me more ideas.  I'm sure there are a ton.\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"\/img\/greenline.gif\" class=\"greenline\" alt=\"{{divider}}\" \/><\/p>\r\n\r\n<strong>Update:<\/strong>  This sort of came up in conversation over Thanksgiving week, after I had written most of the post, but before I actually posted it.  (You'd be surprised at how much I write and discard.)  It seems like Billy Joel probably does win the title of Best Artist that Nobody Hates.\r\n\r\nWhen I was a kid, my dad had these work friends who were nuts about being Catholic and about Billy Joel.  We went to their house for what was probably a Super Bowl.  My family always went to watch the Super Bowl with Dad's work friends rather than with their real friends, of which there were plenty of other gatherings.  I'm not sure why.  \r\n\r\nThese friends talked about how they would stay up all night, with the VCR set to record but on pause, wired remote in hand, just waiting to unpause during the first millisecond of a Billy Joel video. They had them all recorded, even though they had stayed up hours and hours into the night many times.  Man we lived in a dark age.\r\n\r\nThey were also very unhappy with the church, because the Pope had mentioned that he wasn't a fan of \"Only the Good Die Young.\"\r\n\r\nAnyway, send me your ideas about who should be on the list.  \r\n"

I hope our real navy never gets to the point where we rely on sail any more, but I like that they're getting the kids ready, just in case.\r\n\r\nI always check in on Tulane too.  Parltly, because my friend Dave picks Tulane as his underdog as reliably as crazies will wait out a hurricane in Key West, and partly because I just pull for all of the in state schools, assuming none of them ever get good enough to challenge LSU.\r\n\r\nI'm wondering if CBSSN replays games during the week, like the ESPN channels do during slow fall weekdays.  Google wouldn't tell me, no matter how I phrased the question, I couldn't really find anything.

We did better than that, by accidentally falling into a promotoional year for Canadian National Parks where all admission fees were waived for their sesquicentennial.

She waved us down to use a phone, but she couldn't catch her friend.  We wished her well and went to set up our campsite. \r\n\r\nOnce we were all set up, her boyfriend called back.  He was something like six hours away and wanted us to bring a phone back to her so they could figure out what to do.  I already had the tent up on the van and a hammock tied to the luggage rack, so the boys and I started to walk.  We were right by a pretty little river, so I brought my camera along.\r\n\r\nWe were almost there, when K started screaming, \"BEAR! BEAR! BEAR!\"\r\n\r\nSure enough, a skinny black bear was crossing the road about 50 yards in front of us.  I had the presence of mind to tell the kids to start walking away backwards.  (Fuck that locked out lady!)  Noise wasn't a problem -- never is with Kolya around.  \r\n\r\nShe looked right up at us, but then moved across the road with little apparent interest.  I decided to brave a picture.  I fumbled with the camera forever, but finally clicked off a pic.  It should have been natural.  I had taken right at 1000 pictures with that camera so far on the trip.  But I apparently was so freaked out of my head that I couldn't work it.

The kids will probably spill a cup of flour all over the kitchen within the next 120 seconds, but for now, this is an accurate view.\r\n\r\nThere's a reason that I feel like I need to emphasize our cleanliness.\r\n\r\nAnd it's not because my sister's cleaning lady posts before-and-after pictures of her work on her website.  That's the most horrifying thing I've ever read.  (And yes, she's made the cut more than once.)\r\n\r\nIt's because Kolya jumped out of my Jeep at school drop off this morning, and sprinted full-bore toward the elementary building.  Excited to tell his friends and teacher that he got a fright this morning.\r\n\r\nHe picked up his backpack to leave for school, only to find it occupied by a <i>giant, dying rat<\/i>.  Fuuuuuuuuck!\r\n\r\nLet's back up a little.\r\n\r\nMrs. theskinnyonbenny was working yesterday afternoon, when she spotted a rodent head poking out from the hole in the wall from where a bunch of network cable comes into the room.  She sprinted out of there, and we had this text exchange.\r\n\r\nI searched for it when I got home, but I couldn't find it.  The cat was just lounging on the couch with no worries at all.  I figured it poked its head out took a peek, and left.  To be safe, I crammed the hole full of steel wool (rats hate it, I am told) and covered it up.  Then, I put down a glue trap and locked the room up.\r\n\r\nKolya and I checked the trap this morning.  I didn't have my glasses or contacts on, but I could see well enough to know there was no rat on the trap.  Had I been wearing them, I would have seen that something had gotten stuck there, eaten the cheese, and then pried itself off.  But I didn't.\r\n\r\nFast forward an hour, Kolya screams in fear of the rat in his backpack.  I tossed it out the door, and it lay on the ground barely breathing, almost as big as the cat.  It was clearly poisoned and close to death, so I'm glad the cat didn't get into a tussle and poison himself in the process.  Kolya was a little shaken up on the ride to school, but began to perk up when I asked if he was going to tell his friends or keep a lid on it.\r\n\r\nIt was a truly nasty morning, and I hope to never have a repeat of this."

We've been side by side in the car for almost an hour, and we're still flipping through radio channels, trying to find some decent tunes that we aren't tired of.\r\n\r\nFor the 6th or 7th time in the hour, we land on the hip-hop oldies channel.  It's \"Banned in The U.S.A\" by 2 Live Crew.  We keep it on.\r\n\r\nMaybe it's the current state of national affairs.  Maybe it's that I'm a sucker for stories where the little guy sticks it to those who make the rules.  I was tickled pink by <i>The People vs Larry Flynt<\/i>, <i>Private Parts<\/i>, and <i>Straight Outta Compton<\/i>, despite not being a big fan of Hustler or Howard Stern.  (I do like a little N.W.A. now and then.)  \r\n<!--more-->\r\nBut it strikes me that \"Banned in the U.S.A\" is a really good, and a very patriotic song.  It's much more patriotic in its expression of \"no one can trample on our right to free speech in this country\" than the song it samples\/spoofs.  Politicians love to play the Boss's \"Born in the U.S.A.\" at their events, presumingly having never listened to the lyrics.  For you youngsters, it's an 80s hit about a guy who returns from was just to be shit on by an America who doesn't really care about his sacrifices.  Again, it's hard not to think of current events.\r\n\r\nI try to bring my mind back to the 80s. I was a member of the generation whose parents were losing their damned minds over the music.  \"Satanic lyrics\" was in the news night after night.  Record banning was the cause of the day.  Three kids in West Memphis got convicted of murder with the only real evidence being that they liked to listen to metal and the adults were scared shitless.\r\n\r\nThe song ends, and another pile of poo is on behind.  By now, V is at school, but I'm still in the car channel scanning.  I stop on Outlaw Country.  The song is Kenny Rogers \"Coward of the County.\"  It's a terrible country song released in 1979 that I heard on old dail-based radios in the 80s no less than 9000 times, but I haven't heard it in years. I settle in for one more listen.\r\n\r\nThe song tells the story of a guy who didn't like to fight.  People made fun of him, but he was fine.  Until one day, his wife was gang raped.  Then, he fought the rapists.\r\n\r\nYes, for real.  That's the story of the song.\r\n\r\nJesus H. Christ, it's a terrible song!  \r\n\r\nSo to recap, parents in the 80s were okay with the rape song being on the radio all the time, but not the black kids on cassette tapes chanting \"Hey, we want some pussy,\" a vulgarly worded, but entirely normal sentiment for young men.\r\n\r\nNow that I've peaked your interests, I present what I promise is the only playlist to ever feature these three songs together:\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"https:\/\/embed.spotify.com\/?uri=spotify%3Auser%3Abens4lsu%3Aplaylist%3A33FFFjxVaGGAJfahxDgt9Q\" width=\"300\" height=\"380\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;margin-top:2.5em;\"><\/iframe>"

Women strolled past the cabinets every day to do their thing.  The secret hoarding of the documents was long since public knowledge, but since they were out of the boss man's sight, he never followed up on his order that they be removed.\r\n\r\nI can't imagine how annoying that would be for me if I worked there every day.

I got up early and hauled a small tailgate party's worth of chairs, tables, and music out into the driveway so that I could collapse exhaustedly into my chair and nurse my breakfast alcohol as healthy people who had already run 23 miles (23!) that morning passed.\r\n<!--more-->\r\nThe first runner passed a bit under two hours after the start of the race, which worked out to a 5 minute mile pace.  The last racer was some time after the race had been going on for 5 hours, and he was accompanied by the embarrassing peloton of police cars and support vehicles that follow the last runner.  I need to tip the cap to the runner who was keeping himself a few blocks ahead of last place while drunk as a skunk.  \r\n\r\n<a class=\"lightview alignright\" href=\"\/img\/vmarathon.jpg\" data-lightview-caption=\"V, enjoying the Louisiana Marathon of Staying In Pajamas.\" data-lightview-group=\"group1\"><img src=\"\/img\/vmarathon.jpg\" alt=\"\/img\/vmarathon.jpg\" width=\"350px\"><br><span class=\"caption alignleft\">V, enjoying the Louisiana Marathon of Staying In Pajamas.<\/span><\/a>\r\n\r\nThe demeanor of the runners who pass is anything from ulta-serious (ignoring those of us who shout support with grim determination on their faces) to those who stop, eat, drink, and even take selfies with us.  I'd love to get copies of those from over the years.  A lot of the runners are super fun, and as you would expect, the further back in the race, the more fun the participants.\r\n\r\nStupidly, I didn't have a camera with me, and that caused me to miss two images that we would all laugh about for years to come.  The first was escaped beagle Lily, with her ancient joints and 200% of ideal body weight catching sight of all of the runners passing from the spot she was back toward her house.  She slipped into the stream of people and sprinted right along with them, ears flopping and tail wagging.  She covered the half block as quickly as the runners and immediately flopped down for a happy rest.\r\n\r\nMy second missed image was Vanya, bored with holding out cups with water, nuts, or juice, asking if he can hold out a beer.  I gave my assent, and he picked a 10oz can of Miller Light out of someone's ice chest and extended his arm into the river of runners.  No one in the first wave took it, so he sprinted up the block to meet the next group.  I looked up to see the 10 year old trying to force a cold beer onto the runners RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE COP who was there to block the intersection.\r\n\r\nI called him home and explained how Dad didn't really relish the idea of sobering up in a jail cell.  The officer mercifully pretended not to notice.  (Pro tip:  when a policeman blocks off an intersection near your house, walk down and offer him full access to drinks and bathrooms.  They probably won't take you up on it, but they are always appreciative.)\r\n"

There's red writing on the back that someone with younger eyes than mine tells me says, \"National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation.\"  This is just about perfect, because that one had nothing to do with Wally World.  \r\n\r\nI have no recollection of ever having seen this ornament before.  It was probably on the end of a zipper on something that someone else got for Christmas last year when it accidentally got dropped in with our ornaments.

It's the crappiest of many ornaments that my mom made me take from their home.\r\n\r\nThe most horrifying thing about this is that it's dated 1984.  That puts me at having painted this at the ripe old age of 13.  Was I a pussy, or what?\r\n\r\nI can only hope that it was a day full of freezing rain, and that whatever hijinx Jeanne was up to with Major Nelson and Major Heely was one I had already seen 700 times."

It ended up being a really big corn maze that I suspect looked very little like its map picture:\r\n<!--more-->\r\n<a class=\"lightview centered\" href=\"\/img\/cornmazemap.jpg\" data-lightview-caption=\"Corn Maze Map\" data-lightview-group=\"group1\"><img src=\"\/img\/cornmazemap.jpg\" alt=\"\/img\/cornmazemap.jpg\"><br><span class=\"caption\">Corn Maze Map<\/span><\/a>\r\n\r\nBut we walked through as the evening turned from dusk to dark, and it was enough to spook the kids.  That's ironic, because as we left, we saw the sign pointing to the actual haunted ones with the chainsaw weilding manics and zombies.  The kids wouldn't even go down the wide open dark path that lead to the actual haunted maze, so Mrs. theskinnyonbenny had to go through by herself.  She confirmed what I heard by talking to the mother of some other chicken littles -- that it was fun, but not particularly scary.\r\n\r\nSaturday morning, we left the house and headed for New Orleans to piece together costumes and top that off with the Boo at the Zoo trip.  Our timing was great again, and we got to the haunted train ride just as the sky flipped from dusk to dark.  K got on the train full of courage and even took an empty seat in front of me.  But before it pulled away, he started to falter and was back in my lap.  The courage disappeared entirely as we rounded the first curve and were treated to convincing screams of a torture victim on a table surrounded by fake maniacs.\r\n\r\nWe were toward the fornt, so most of the monsters popping out of bushes to menace the riders were behind us, but by the end, he was in full blown tears.  A succesful haunted train ride, in my book.\r\n\r\nWe followed up with the trick or treating, a few games, and got a couple of free Pelican-logoed selfie sticks from their setup.  And then, back to the car and home.\r\n\r\nThe next weekend, we went to New Orleans for a magic show and Voodoo fest.  The magic show was cool, highlighted by a nut who stuffed a coin into his eye socket and back around the back of his eyeball.  I think he snorked it through his sinuses and palmed it from there, but it appeared that he cut open his forearm and extracted the coin from there.  Either way, it was pretty revolting.  The kids liked the escape artist dropped into a water tank best.\r\n\r\nAt Voodoo Fest on Saturday, V made me feel like the worst parent in the world by getting busted trying to sneak in one of my flasks.  I didn't think they would do a thorough kid search.  K was distraught that we would even make the attempt.  \"WHY WOULD WE DO THIS?

Please watch; it's the funniest thing I've seen in weeks.\r\n\r\n<iframe width=\"420\" height=\"315\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/IglhSNNk7Qk\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen style=\"display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;\"><\/iframe>\r\n\r\nI was and am more than a little relieved that all of the kids at Episcopal have to eat school lunch.  It also turned out that the other duty parents were old hands, so I just had to follow their leads.\r\n\r\n<a class=\"lightview centered\" href=\"\/img\/flood1.jpg\r\n\" data-lightview-caption=\"Flooded neighborhood on the way to school.

One boy's mother will never realize the debt I'm owed for catching him about to wipe big tomato sauce streaks on his shirt and giving a panicked shout for him to use his napkin instead.  I implore every lunch duty parent to remind the kids that there are napkins, because that's all it takes for quite a lot of them.\r\n\r\nOne poor kid was beyond hope, and his family got one and only one wear out of his $35 uniform shirt.\r\n\r\nThis one's for you, little dude:\r\n\r\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/7wRHBLwpASw\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen style=\"display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;\"><\/iframe>"

They released what we all called \"New Coke,\" which was formulated to taste as much like Pepsi as possible.  After the predictable blowback, Coke returned as \"Coca Cola Classic,\" and New Coke faded into food history.\r\n\r\nBut the classic wasn't the original Coke.  This is when they made the switch from sugar to high fructose corn syrup as a cheaper sweetener.  The move was genius -- they gave us time to forget the subtle better taste of sugar, while simultaneously propping up demand for what we would believe to be the original product.  \r\n\r\nPlease don't burst my bubble with the Snopes article debunking this theory.

On top of goofing around at the ol' landing, we visited the zoo, aquarium, IMAX, parades, bowling, a cool lights display in city park, Preservation Hall, and went to a barbecue festival.  We probably ate at least five top-notch meals and several more very good ones.  We had warm sunny weather, and freezing cold rain.\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\r\nAll of that bookended by two days of sailing.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/theskinnyonbenny.com\/pg4.php?spgmGal=136%20-%20Easter%20Trip%202016\">It's mostly (but not all) documented in the pictures<\/a>, and this is one of my favorite collections in a really long time.\r\n\r\nOne of the things that doesn't make the pictures is a dinghy ride that I took with the kids.  We were passing a family on the bank who was trying to fish.  One of the family was a litte person.\r\n\r\nI saw K looking over there, and right on cue, his eyes got big and he started to point.  I grabbed his hand and told him it was rude.  And I suggested that he should whisper whatever it was that he wanted to tell me.  I knew that this would be my opportunity to give him the \"people come in all shapes\" sort of lesson.\r\n\r\n<a class=\"lightview alignright\" href=\"http:\/\/theskinnyonbenny.com\/img\/gal\/136%20-%20Easter%20Trip%202016\/data\/normal.jpg\" data-lightview-caption=\"After walking to the zoo.\" data-lightview-group=\"group1\"><img src=\"http:\/\/theskinnyonbenny.com\/img\/gal\/136%20-%20Easter%20Trip%202016\/data\/normal.jpg\" alt=\"http:\/\/theskinnyonbenny.com\/img\/gal\/136%20-%20Easter%20Trip%202016\/data\/normal.jpg\" width=\"350px\"><br><span class=\"caption alignleft\">After walking to the zoo.<\/span><\/a>\r\n\r\nHe leaned in and stage whispered, \"That man just put his hook in the water with no bait on it!\"\r\n\r\nAhh, yes.  Well there's that too.\r\n\r\nI got a couple of good compliments about how independent and confident the kids are.  One evening, we were walking down the road, having just finished mauling a candy apple.  K looked like a clown with all of the red sugar dye on his hands and face, and there was a looming dinner reservation.  The nearest place that looked family friendly was Bubba Gump's, so we dashed into the restaurant, and found the bathroom.\r\n\r\nWhen K and I came out, V had the bar lined up with cokes for us all, and he had even taken the liberty of ordering himself a souvenir glass that lit up.  \r\n\r\nThe waiter made a special trip to tell me what a cool and confident kid he was, and even said that he hopes his own new son grows up like to be like V.

Normally the quicker of the two, Kolya scrutinized shitty candy after shitty candy unable to decide.

I'm not nearly old enough to have been married twenty years, just as I am not nearly old enough to have a younger sister who dotes on grandchildren, yet here we are in a weird parallel universe where both things are ture.\r\n\r\nAs I realize that it's not exactly commonplace for someone as youthful and handsome as myself to have been married so long, I thought I would post some secrets of marital longevity.\r\n\r\n<ol><li><b>Have opposing chicken wing preferences.<\/b>  Perhaps no single factor leads to more marital harmony than sharing a plate of chicken wings without feeling like your partner keeps snagging the wings that you wanted to eat.  If you prefer the drumette, find a partner who prefers the forearm, and vice versa.\r\n\r\nThere really should be a word for the forearm part that we universally acknowledge.  I just googled <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?q=parts+of+a+chicken+wing&tbm=isch&tbo=u&source=univ&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjUxaj77sLJAhVB7D4KHalSChUQsAQIHA&biw=1710&bih=731\" target=\"_blank\">parts of a chicken wing<\/a>, and there are a variety of opinions to what it should be called.  Forearm works for me, but I understand the inclination to find a word that sounds more like food.\r\n\r\nDammit, I'm hungry.  I wish I hadn't looked at all of those pictures of chicken wings.\r\n\r\n<\/li><li><b>Just drive.<\/b>  If your partner hates to drive, and you would rather sleep or read than drive, just buy an energy drink and take your spot behind the wheel.  Odds are that your road-hating partner thinks that four inches is plenty of following distance on the interstate when he or she is driving anyway, and if so, you'll have trouble drifting off to sleep while your pilot stares into the road with the intensity of Mario Andretti making 210 mph ovals in heavy traffic.  Easier for everyone if you just take the wheel.\r\n\r\nAs an added bonus, most people instinctively give the driver control of the radio.  I've personally made my family listen all sorts of sports talk idiots that they must have dreaded with every fiber of their being.  Once, I made them listen to a Wimbledon final on the radio while we drove through the back country nothingness between Miami and Orlando.  Have you ever listened to tennis on the radio?  \"Serve is in, and back.  Federer hits it back, and back, to the corner, back across, over, back, AND IT CATCHES THE BASELINE FOR A POINT!!!!\"\r\n\r\nWho's point?  It gets very hard to tell.  Just keep driving.\r\n\r\n<\/li><li><b>Wet your whistle.<\/b>  All of your partner's grating little annoyances turn into charming little quirks when mixed with a warm, sweet, stomach coating of your favorite intoxicant.  Not only that, but the kids don't sound as loud, the money shortages don't seem that dire, and after a drinks or two, either of you is perfectly willing to scoop up that wet cat hairball bare-handed.\r\n\r\nYou've got to be a little careful here, especially if one of you is a fan of the fightin' liquors (whiskey, tequila).  Also, too many evening cocktails before homework time really, really sucks.  A week or two ago, I might have signed off on a reading page that didn't really get read, and now I get lobbied for homework cheats every couple of days.\r\n\r\n<\/li><li><b>Establish a common rooting interest.<\/b>  You want to have at least one area where you're rooting for the same team.  It can be a mutually shared hatred of the Patriots, a common desire to elect the biggest douchebag in the city council as the next mayor, or a fanatic following of the dude your partner dated in high school who is now the 34th ranked professional bowler in the world.  That way, when you sense that the conversation is going to take a turn toward, \"did you ever change the upstairs light bulbs like you said you would?\" you can throw it in a different direction with something like, \"Did you see Donald Trump mock that reporter with the googoo face?\"\r\n\r\nI don't have anything else to say here, but I have some style issue where my list spacing sucks unless I have more than one paragraph in the list.  No time to figure it out, q.e.d., this sentence.\r\n\r\n<\/li><li><b>Lots and lots of oral sex.<\/b>  This might not really be applicable to my own life, but I can't imagine that anyone in a relationship is too very unhappy when oral sex is part of the daily routine.  If you are unhappily married despite lots of trips where the trolley rolls downtown, please let me know in the comments.  You, my friend, are one of the most fascinating people we've encountered.\r\n<\/li><\/ul>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n"

It's not that YouTube makes me watch a commercial so that I can get to the commercial that I'm trying to watch.  It's that they piss on the whole premise of this spot by ending with, \"Now part of the AT&T family.\"\r\n\r\nDid they have this in the works before the AT&T\/DirectTV takeover and then just not have the balls to kill it?  Or do the marketing people have their heads so far up the corporate behind that they don't recognize their own face?\r\n\r\n(I'm could have probably worked that metaphor out a little better.)\r\n\r\nJust really stupid.\r\n\r\nAnd, it really is gripe-worthy that YouTube makes you watch a commercial to watch a commercial.  If I had known that one before I started to write, it would have it's own entry in the ennumeration.\r\n\r\nGripe #2:\r\n\r\nI really like Apple Pay.  I use it where I can.  One of those places is Whole Foods.  But when my total at Whole Foods is over some threshold -- and I'm not sure where this threshold is, but it's somewhere between a coffee and a week of groceries -- they make me sign the screen pad when I pay.\r\n\r\nThe whole point of the signature is to prove that it was me at the register if I decide to claim it wasn't.  But with Apple Pay, the system has already validated my thumbprint.  That's WAY better proof that I'm me than my signature is.  Get rid of that, Whole Foods!\r\n\r\nThat was fun.

We've had nothing but beautiful weather for as many days as I can remember, and I especially can't think of when it was as wet and as ugly as it was this weekend.\r\n\r\nBut the weekend before was the last in a long line of absolutely perfect weather.\r\n \r\nWe decided to sail to Mandeville, a town that's usually four or five hours from our home dock.  It's a nice little town, with a publicly funded wall fitted with water and power that's absolutely free to the visiting sailor.  Once there, you have a playground for the kids right there, the yacht club ( = bar for mom and dad, plus another playground), and many other places to eat or drink within an easy lakefront walk.  It's certainly worth an overnight trip.\r\n<!--more-->\r\n<iframe src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/142957004?color=b5b5ce&byline=0&portrait=0\" width=\"650\" height=\"366\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/vimeo.com\/142957004\">Sailing into Mandeville 2015-10-17<\/a> from <a href=\"https:\/\/vimeo.com\/user244752\">ben schultz<\/a> on <a href=\"https:\/\/vimeo.com\">Vimeo<\/a>.<\/p>\r\n<span class=\"caption alignleft\">Sailing from Slidell to Mandeville in two minutes.<\/span>\r\n\r\nWe had a fast and comfortable sail into town, and we reached the public dock about 30 minutes ahead of sunset.  One other vessel was on the wall, and a few drunk visitors came over and grabbed our lines for us.  They made the tie-up extremely easy.  We spent a little while putting boat stuff away and digging out sweatshirts, shoes, and a camera for the walk into town.  On our way out, our dockside friends expressed interest in hanging out with Lily instead of having us lock her down in the cabin.  I knew that Lily would rather hang out with people than be locked up alone, and knew that they could just stick her back aboard if they got tired of her.  And if they turned out to be maniacs who eat dog?  Well, Lily's 10 now.  We would miss her, but we've had a good run.\r\n\r\nWe ended up walking to a restaurant called The Beach, which we've visisted many times.  It's a good place to watch football (and this was during the LSU\/Florida game) and there's a play area so that kids can entertain themselves some without bothering the grown-ups.  I was surprised that there were plenty of empty seats even though we got there right at kickoff.\r\n\r\nWhen the game was almost over, I got a call from a number I didn't know.  Guessing that it was dog-related, I picked up.  An irritated, bitchy woman told me to come get my dog, who had been tied to a post next to the boats.  I told her that I would, but that we were walking, and it would take us a little time to get there.  \r\n\r\nI called her back a few minutes later and told her just to put Lily on the black sail boat.  She said, \"I'm not comfortable leaving her on a boat by herself.\"  Suit yourself, sister.  I went right back to watching the game, which was too close to abandon at that point. \r\n\r\nOnce LSU took possession for the last time, and the game seemed to be in hand, we got up to leave.  My phone rang again.  This time, it was the Mandeville police.  I explained that I had told the woman that I would be a little while, and that I was in route, on foot, back to the boats.  The officer seemed fine with that.\r\n\r\nOn the way back, a patrol car pulled up to asked for us by name.  I'm still curious if they knew our name from a phone number lookup or from a lookup of the boat name.\r\n\r\nOnce we got closer to the boats, a different office met us on foot.  He asked for our story, and warned us that the drunk people were troublemakers.  We made a mild defense of them and expressed surprise that the town's police force seemed to have mobilized on a Saturday night, just on account of an overfed beagle.  The officer told us something like, \"It's because nothing ever happens in this town.  It's like Mayberry.  Literally.  Believe me, this is the most excitement we'll have all night.\"\r\n\r\nThen he told us that the local teenagers would be along the section of street next to our boats to hang out after dark.  He told us to let them know if the kids were unruly, as he would relish a reason to run them all out of there.\r\n\r\nBack along the water, the nosy dog lover had Lily on a leash.  I think she wanted to give me a lecture, but my walking up with one kid on my shoulders and another holding my arm took the wind out of her sails.  I just said, \"Sorry for the trouble,\" and she replied, \"okay.\"\r\n\r\nDog lover left pretty quickly, and not long after, crazy semi-homeless came by to apologize.  We told him that there was no problem and offered him a beer.  Mrs. theskinnyonbenny referred to dog lady as a busybody, which is now Oscar's favorite word.  \r\n\r\n\"Busy body.  That's just the word I was looking for!  She was a busybody!\"\r\n\r\nA little while later, I could hear him on the other boat.  \"Like that lady over there said, she was a busybody!\"\r\n\r\nWe ended up bullshitting with the members of the other crew for a while.  They were a couple from New York, who had worked their way down over the course of several years.  One gets the impression that they might just be staying one step ahead of the law.  A real mariner <i>Dukes of Hazard<\/i> type of thing.  They would probably make for a good reality show.  The third member of the crew was Oscar, who Mrs. theskinnyonbenny compared to the scary bounty hunter guy from <i>Raising Arizona<\/i>.\r\n\r\nOscar was itching for a fight, and the only enemies he could muster were the high school kids, who come to the lakefront to sit in their cars and stare into their cell phones late at night.  I didn't see any sign of drinking, smoking pot, sex, and I didn't even hear loud music.  I'm glad I grew up in the 80s.  His partner talked him down the few times he expressed his need to scratch the itch.\r\n\r\n<a class=\"lightview alignright\" href=\"\/img\/mandevilleoscar.jpg\" data-lightview-caption=\"Oscar sees us off in style.\" data-lightview-group=\"group1\"><img src=\"\/img\/mandevilleoscar.jpg\" alt=\"\/img\/mandevilleoscar.jpg\"><br><span class=\"caption alignleft\">Oscar sees us off in style.<\/span><\/a>\r\n\r\nOnce Oscar made moves as if he were going to sleep in our cockpit, the captain of this little crew took the further step of herding the group to bed down where they belong.\r\n\r\nBefore we got ourselves down, we chatted with a friendly family from Tupelo, who was visiting the lakefront to try to catch fish, and then with a guy with a guitar, who came aboard and played some pretty good tunes for half an hour or so.  It turns out that he had been at some kind of show, and at the end, the band invited audience members to jam with him, and he was riding high from performing well.  I wish I knew the name of our 1:30AM companion, because he really was very good, and I wouldn't mind hearing him play again some time soon.\r\n\r\nAnd that concluded the oddest dockside night that I can remember.\r\n\r\nThe next day, we thundered out of Mandeville, flying the new spinnaker in 10-14 knot winds.  Velvet Elvis was absolutely flying downwind, in a way that I didn't know was possible.  But not before a noisy sendoff from Oscar, who appeared out of nowhere to see us off the dock (in front of a large assembling regatta) with hearty screaming (\"VANYA!  ROCK ON LITTLE MAN!!!\"), and with the waving of a Confederate Flag crossed with a silhouetted machine gun and some writing that I couldn't make out."

Traffic is better, people are out until late, and packs of camp kids broadcast noises from unexpected city blocks.\r\n\r\nAfter being mostly away the past two weeks, our kids started camps this week.  Vanya is doing dance, arts, and music at a camp that he seems to be enjoying quite a bit.  Kolya is going to one that seems pretty similar to preschool.  Let's face it, though.  Preschool is a day-long session of dicking around in fun ways that also happen to be educational for little kids.  Drawing, Play-doh, songs.  It's a pretty good day compared to yours and mine.\r\n<!--more-->\r\nI took K to his first day yesterday.  He was all into it as he held my hand and marched across the parking lot.  By the time we got into the classroom, there was a little tear running down his cheek, and when he saw that I saw it, he went into full-blown leg grabbing at full strength.  It's not nearly as heartbreaking as when toddler Vanya got nervous, as I know that K is one of the bravest little kids ever.  He's certain to ask his skydiving instructor to set his jump suit on fire on his way out of the plane, just to up the adrenaline rush a tick or two.\r\n\r\nI got him to a table where he could write and draw, and he didn't look back as I scurried out the door.  At the end of the day, he had great things to say about camp.  He described is teachers as, \"REALLY nice\" and claimed to like camp better than school, which is saying something.\r\n\r\nToday, he wanted me to walk him into the building, but let him go through the classroom door by himself so that I wouldn't be seen.  That's the Kolya I know.\r\n\r\nHe has really shown off his bravery at the pool this summer, doing spinners off the side deck or jumping recklessly in over his head in an attempt to beat kids twice his age and two-and-a-half times his height to a loose basketball.  Sunday, he decided he was ready to jump to me off of the diving board.  Sometimes, he landed right in front of me so I would easily lift him out of the water.  Other times, he would plunge so deep that I would actually have to dive down and swim a couple of strokes to get deep enough to grab his little arms.  He would be swimming toward the surface and grinning under water.\r\n\r\nHere are a few recent pool pics, from a day where we waited about 3 hours for the little local storm to pass before they reopened the pool.  As soon as we got in, there was one more rumble of thunder, but a lifeguard took pity and declared that it was only a passing truck.\r\n\r\n<a class=\"lightview centered\" href=\"\/img\/IMG_20150531_161350_1597.JPG\" data-lightview-caption=\"Getting ready for a spinner\" data-lightview-group=\"group1\"><img src=\"\/img\/IMG_20150531_161350_1597.JPG\" alt=\"\/img\/IMG_20150531_161350_1597.JPG\" width=\"500px\"><br><span class=\"caption\">Getting ready for a spinner<\/span><\/a>\r\n\r\n<a class=\"lightview centered\" href=\"\/img\/IMG_20150531_170018_1612.JPG\" data-lightview-caption=\"Deep water ring retriever.\" data-lightview-group=\"group1\"><img src=\"\/img\/IMG_20150531_170018_1612.JPG\" alt=\"\/img\/IMG_20150531_170018_1612.JPG\" height=\"500px\"><br><span class=\"caption\">Deep water ring retriever.<\/span><\/a>\r\n\r\n<a class=\"lightview centered\" href=\"\/img\/IMG_20150531_163558_1609.JPG\" data-lightview-caption=\"Happy underwater boy.\" data-lightview-group=\"group1\"><img src=\"\/img\/IMG_20150531_163558_1609.JPG\" alt=\"\/img\/IMG_20150531_163558_1609.JPG\" width=\"350px\"><br><span class=\"caption\">Happy underwater boy.<\/span><\/a>"

I don't know if those specific examples are legit, but he had to have said that 39 times.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Deadspin posted a series of longform articles on <a href=\"http:\/\/deadspin.com\/tag\/black-grantland\" target=\"_blank\">ESPN's \"Black Grantland\"<\/a> money-suck, and once I read the first word, I couldn't stop until I had devoured every sentence in the series.  The inner workings of entertainment\/media companies is really a fascinating topic, and this account ranks up there with <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B0047Y177U\/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B0047Y177U&linkCode=as2&tag=theskinnyonbe-20&linkId=TGWWMKQS5LQDMLLW\" target=\"_blank:>ESPN the book<\/a>, and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B0047Y177U\/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B0047Y177U&linkCode=as2&tag=theskinnyonbe-20&linkId=TGWWMKQS5LQDMLLW\" target=\"_blank\">Top of the Rock<\/a>.\r\n\r\nThe funniest part of this was the section of quotes that Whitlock included in his motivational playbook, half of which he attributes to himself.  \"Learn the rules so you'll know when and how to properly break them.\"  Really, Jason Whitlock?  You're the first to have come up with that sentiment?  Because it really seems like something that someone else might have said before 2015.  Just sayin'.\r\n\r\nIn less bitchy news (but still a little bitchy, I admit), I spent about 10 hours installing a new stereo on Velvet Elvis over the past two weekends.  Like anything on a boat, the first try was a false start, with me undoing things that didn't need to be undone, finally figuring out what everything was, and then ultimately needing to order a cord that wasn't supplied with the stereo at all.  For all of that, I got the ability to turn the volume up and down without walking down into the cabin, added Sirius radio, and got it where weather radar blobs show up on the chart plotter as we're sailing.  In all, it's only questionably worth the time and money, but the volume thing has been great, and it will be really nice to see the storm cells if we're out at night and see lightning on the horizon.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Our first this year was a Slidell parade, which featured a handful of floats, a Waffle house truck, and hundreds of little girl dance squads.  \r\n\r\n<a class=\"lightview centered\" href=\"\/img\/resIMG_20150207_200746_4043.JPG\" data-lightview-caption=\"The Waffle House float\/truck.\r\n\" data-lightview-group=\"group1\"><img src=\"\/img\/resIMG_20150207_200746_4043.JPG\" alt=\"\/img\/resIMG_20150207_200746_4043.JPG\" width=\"350px\"><br><span class=\"caption\">The Waffle House float\/truck.\r\n<\/span><\/a>\r\n\r\nThe day after that, we went to New Orleans to retrieve some sort of thing for Mrs. theskinnyonbenny's parade.  On our way home from there, we stopped at a lakeside restaurant in LaPlace, which was very good.  As you know, I can't resist taking pictures of Louisiana waterways.\r\n\r\n<a class=\"lightview centered\" href=\"\/img\/resIMG_20150208_140412_4064 2.JPG\" data-lightview-caption=\"\" data-lightview-group=\"group1\"><img src=\"\/img\/resIMG_20150208_140412_4064 2.JPG\" alt=\"\/img\/resIMG_20150208_140412_4064 2.JPG\" width=\"350px\"><br><span class=\"caption\"><\/span><\/a>\r\n<a class=\"lightview centered\" href=\"\/img\/resIMG_20150208_140830_4072.JPG\" data-lightview-caption=\"Lake Pontchartrain from LaPlace\r\n\" data-lightview-group=\"group1\"><img src=\"\/img\/resIMG_20150208_140830_4072.JPG\" alt=\"\/img\/resIMG_20150208_140830_4072.JPG\" width=\"350px\"><br><span class=\"caption\">Lake Pontchartrain from LaPlace\r\n<\/span><\/a>\r\n\r\nThe next week, Mrs. theskinnyonbenny abandoned the rest of us on Tuesday to go down for parade prep.  The kids and I ate Piccadilly, which holds one of my favorite policies -- treat dad's alone with their kids like they are incapable imbeciles.  An employee hurried around to push one of our trays down the cafeteria line, and then carried it to the table for me.\r\n\r\n<a class=\"lightview centered\" href=\"\/img\/resIMG_20150212_181544_4101.JPG\" data-lightview-caption=\"K waits at the hotel bar for his Shirley Temple to be prepared.\r\n\" data-lightview-group=\"group1\"><img src=\"\/img\/resIMG_20150212_181544_4101.JPG\" alt=\"\/img\/resIMG_20150212_181544_4101.JPG\" width=\"350px\"><br><span class=\"caption\">K waits at the hotel bar for his Shirley Temple to be prepared.\r\n<\/span><\/a>\r\n\r\nWe went down Thursday after school, caught three parades, which left the kids cold and exhausted.  They were retired to my mother's hotel room, and the fun loving adults headed to the after party, which had delicious gumbo, and open bar, and a super-surprisingly good performance by Salt N Peppa.  I didn't realize it, but Spinderella is the real talent up there.  Let me add that she has aged extremely well.\r\n\r\n<a class=\"lightview centered\" href=\"\/img\/resIMG_20150213_011312_4114.JPG\" data-lightview-caption=\"Salt N Peppa HERE!\r\n\" data-lightview-group=\"group1\"><img src=\"\/img\/resIMG_20150213_011312_4114.JPG\" alt=\"\/img\/resIMG_20150213_011312_4114.JPG\" width=\"350px\"><br><span class=\"caption\">Salt N Peppa HERE!\r\n<\/span><\/a>\r\n\r\nFriday was for rest and recuperation, if not for giving little kids baths.\r\n\r\nSaturday, we were back down to New Orleans to catch another couple of day parades with the JC family, in town from fair Minnesota.  \r\n\r\n<a class=\"lightview centered\" href=\"\/img\/resIMG_20150214_172726_4136.JPG\" data-lightview-caption=\"JC, the biggest kid at Mardi Gras\r\n\" data-lightview-group=\"group1\"><img src=\"\/img\/resIMG_20150214_172726_4136.JPG\" alt=\"\/img\/resIMG_20150214_172726_4136.JPG\" width=\"350px\"><br><span class=\"caption\">JC, the biggest kid at Mardi Gras\r\n<\/span><\/a>\r\n\r\nThat still left Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday for Mardi Gras propper, but instead of staying in Louisiana, we boarded Velvet Elvis and pointed the bow toward Mississippi.  More on that later.\r\n\r\nSomewhere in all of that, the Louisiana Junior String Ensemble had a recital too.  I have more pictures from all of this on the daily photo page, starting <a href=\"http:\/\/theskinnyonbenny.com\/dailyphoto\/2015\/page.php?year=2015&month=2&day=16\">here<\/a>.  Yes, that's bullshit.  I don't like backdated posts either.  But Mardi Gras pics take us up into the beginning of March, and I have some more to post behind those.  "

Tonight, I wondered how much I will remember from the past month.  The answer popped into my head as quickly as the question.  I will only remember what I photograph or write here.  So, as much as I wouldn't enjoy reading someone else's parenting blog....\r\n\r\n(But I have been meaning to tell you all a story about my friend's German neighbor and the phrase \"monkey nuts\" for a good six months.  Let this be a tease.  I'll try to get that story posted over the Christmas break.)\r\n\r\nIn preschool a couple of weeks ago,<!--more--> Kolya's class made gingerbread men.  When they went out to play, the teachers hid them, and they told the kids that the cookies came to life, ran around the classroom, and dared the kids to find them.  The kids looked all over, inside and out, and they couldn't find the runaway gingers.\r\n\r\nThe teachers asked each of us to send a letter reporting a sighting of our kid's men.  Paul did me the favor of penning this one for me to send in.\r\n\r\n<a class=\"lightview centered\" href=\"\/img\/kolyasgingerbreadman.png\" data-lightview-caption=\"\" data-lightview-group=\"group1\"><img src=\"\/img\/kolyasgingerbreadman.png\" alt=\"\/img\/kolyasgingerbreadman.png\"><br><span class=\"caption\"><\/span><\/a>\r\n\r\nA couple of days later, the teachers hatched a plan to lure them back to school with a gingerbread house.  Then plan was a success, and the kids got to eat their cookies.\r\n\r\nOn the other side of the sibling divide, Vanya doesn't want to eat sausage or chicken, because he put it together that it meant killing real live animals.  You read that right.  One won't eat an animal, while the other chows down on what he truly believes to be a live, sentient, intelligent being.\r\n\r\n<a class=\"lightview centered\" href=\"\/img\/penisice.JPG\" data-lightview-caption=\"Ice sculpture?\" data-lightview-group=\"group1\"><img src=\"\/img\/penisice.JPG\" alt=\"\/img\/penisice.JPG\" height=\"350px\"><br><span class=\"caption\">Ice sculpture?<\/span><\/a>\r\n\r\nIn other family news this month, we took the kids down to New Orleans for a day and a night.  We stayed in a hotel, checked out a Christmas store, had some good food, etc.  Our best lunch was at <a href=\"http:\/\/latitude29nola.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Latitude 29<\/a>, where the food and drinks were so good that if you picked up the whole place and dropped it into Des Moines, then suddenly Des Moines is a destination worth flying to for a weekend.\r\n\r\nOne thing they did with one of the cocktails is have the straw run through a block of ice shaped like a pestle (as in \"mortar and...\").  That was cool and all, until you let your kid stick it into his water, and then it melts into an ice cock and balls.  So just keep that in mind when you visit.\r\n\r\nAfter that, we went to the races, on a day that was decidedly different than the day when Peter, Paul, or Mary wrote, \"Oh The Fairgrounds were crowded; and Stewball was there.\"\r\n\r\n<a class=\"lightview centered\" href=\"\/img\/fairgroundswerentcrowded.jpg\" data-lightview-caption=\"The Fairgrounds weren't at all crowded.\" data-lightview-group=\"group1\"><img src=\"\/img\/fairgroundswerentcrowded.jpg\" alt=\"\/img\/fairgroundswerentcrowded.jpg\" width=\"350px\"><br><span class=\"caption\">The Fairgrounds weren't at all crowded.<\/span><\/a>\r\n\r\nMy mom showed up and looked for us, but somehow, she missed us in this massive crowd.  She did notice a guy and a goofy red floppy hat, and just coincidentally, I was wearing a goofy red floppy hat, but she didn't look closely enough to determine that the guy in the goofy red floppy hat had (some four decades previously) sprung from her loins.\r\n\r\nWe closed out our night with a Cirque de Soliel\/Louisiana Symphony combo at the Saenger, which I think we all enjoyed very much.  I only mention it as an excuse to add this picture of Kolya, taking in the lobby of the grand theater for the first time.  I'm compelled to add that I am very sober in this picture, despite appearances to the contrary.\r\n\r\n<a class=\"lightview centered\" href=\"\/img\/saenger.jpg\" data-lightview-caption=\"\" data-lightview-group=\"group1\"><img src=\"\/img\/saenger.jpg\" alt=\"\/img\/saenger.jpg\" height=\"350px\"><br><span class=\"caption\"><\/span><\/a>\r\n\r\nI've got more pics from this trip, which I'll post soon.

I was home by myself, so I welcomed the excuse to ditch the kitchen cleanup and to sit out, smell the meat, and run our mouths.\r\n\r\nFirst, I had to get the fire lit.  I put the meat down and poured the charcoal.  Then, I thought that I needed a water pan under the meat.  The left side of the grill is an upright cold smoker, with a cabinet door that opens like a refrigerator.  I popped it open, and as I was turning a way, a small rat poked his head out, like \"Hello!\"\r\n<!--more-->\r\nPaul's girlie little scream caused me to do the same, and I slammed the door shut quickly.\r\n\r\nI calmed my nerves and worked up some courage, then I opened the door again, and sprinted toward the house at approximately two hundred miles per hour.\r\n\r\nNo rat came out.\r\n\r\nSo I tiptoed back up to the box and looked in the door.  I didn't see him.  I crouched down low and looked up.  He was perched on some sticks that were at the top, for hanging meat.  I never knew those were there before!  How cool.\r\n\r\nI shut the door again, and lit the charcoal in the far away fire box.  Paul crossed the back yard to the point as far from the smoker as it's possible to be, without having left the yard altogether.  The smoke started wafting through the cooker, and I gave it a minute to get to the rat's side.  I threw the door open and sprinted toward the house again.\r\n\r\nWhat happened next will take me ten minutes to write.  It will take you a minute or two to read.  But it all happened in about one half of one second.\r\n\r\nThe rat jumped out of the smoker.  Two grown men shrieked like females in distress in 1950s movies.  EEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!\r\n\r\nBefore the rat hit the ground, Paul's scream switched to a cry of sheer terror.  I was able to turn my head in time to see that he had put a foot on a stray dog turd, which had apparently felt much like an escaping rat underfoot.  Immediately, his face went from fear to agony, as his terrified gyration aggravated the hip that he would soon have surgically replaced.\r\n\r\nBut before I could muster a laugh, I looked back for the rat.  It was on the ground, and it was sprinting RIGHT FOR ME!\r\n\r\nMy pitch increased by an octave and got similarly louder.  It was only about six feet away from me when it took a slight right, diving into the bushes and disappearing forever.\r\n\r\nAnd now, this will be in your head all day anyway, so you might as well enjoy the video:\r\n\r\n<iframe width=\"600\" height=\"450\" src=\"\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/bS0fXQN6zrI\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen class=\"centered\"><\/iframe>"

V was usually a yellow fish, and often a red fish.\r\n\r\n<a class=\"lightview alignright\" href=\"http:\/\/theskinnyonbenny.com\/img\/gal\/049%20-%20Nov%20and%20Early%20Dec%202008\/resIMG_5161.JPG\" data-lightview-caption=\"Vanya in the Fall of 2008\r\n\" data-lightview-group=\"group1\"><img src=\"http:\/\/theskinnyonbenny.com\/img\/gal\/049%20-%20Nov%20and%20Early%20Dec%202008\/resIMG_5161.JPG\" alt=\"http:\/\/theskinnyonbenny.com\/img\/gal\/049%20-%20Nov%20and%20Early%20Dec%202008\/resIMG_5161.JPG\" width=\"350px\"><br><span class=\"caption alignleft\">Vanya in the Fall of 2008\r\n<\/span><\/a>\r\n\r\nAfter the first few red fish, I decided that he had to go into his room by himself with the door closed any time that happened.  So dutifully, I shut him up in there, and sat outside his room feeling terrible.  He wailed through the door, \"I'M SORRY PAPA!  I WON'T DO IT AGAIN!  I PROMISE I WON'T DO IT AGAIN.\"  After a few minutes, I would let him out, but he was a wreck with tear-soaked cheeks, and those sort of quiverry exhales that kids get when they're trying to stop crying. \r\n\r\nAt the turn of the semester, his classmates started having birthday parties, and once we started talking to parents of the other kids in the class, we found out that almost every single kid came home with red fish several times a week.  Every boy did for sure.  And all of us thought we were raising hellions that would cause us no end of grief until they turned 30.  \r\n\r\nAs I type, it's pissing me off all over again.  I put him (and me) through that two or three times a week when he was just being a normal little boy.  I'd like to stuff leaves in that teacher's mouth and beat her with a switch.\r\n\r\nK's preschool is so much better.  They're three now.  The school has no color coded guide that parents are expected to act on.  They say things like, \"Three year olds are supposed to run and play and explore different things.  That's how they learn.\"  And, \"We're trying to get them to stand in a line together.\"  An on the games they play to learn letters and numbers, \"We let them dictate what they're ready to do.\"  I'm sure that seems a little hippy-dippy, but the results prove that they know how little kids learn.\r\n\r\nI still use bedroom isolation as punishment for both of the kids, but not often.  Like any good method, the threat of it is usually enough to stop the behavior.  Yes, both of the kids act like it's the worst torture ever, but I guess that's how it should feel in the moment.  \r\n\r\nI can't forsee anything that would happen that would lead me to even spank one of them, but every parent <a href=\"http:\/\/deadspin.com\/never-give-your-kid-a-cold-shower-advice-from-the-wors-512686828\" target=\"_blank\">loses his shit<\/a> once in a while.

I do not intend to supplement that enjoyment without the option of listening to some tunes.  And I can't be expected to predict which 200 or which 2000 tunes I might want to hear, once I'm out there, so preloading them isn't the answer either.\r\n\r\nApple is going to charge me a monthly fee to stream my own music through the cloud.  <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">That's bullshit<\/span> -- no, that's BULLSHIT.\r\n\r\nAll is not lost.  I did a little analysis last night, and from day to day, I'm taking about 50GB of music (and other audio) with me on my iPod.  That number is growing month by month, but at least I'm not counting on my iPod's full 160 GB capacity.  My phone is using about 35 GB, which is at least half pictures and probably includes a good number of apps that I'd be all to happy to get rid of.  Depending on the true capacity of the 128 GB version of the new phone, I might be able to get by for a while.\r\n\r\nA couple of related music notes:\r\n\r\nI appear to be the only one in the world who feels this way, but Apple can deliver a free U2 album to my library any time they like.  I haven't listened to it yet, but I like knowing it's there.\r\n\r\nI just bought <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B00LIKQU2S\/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00LIKQU2S&linkCode=as2&tag=theskinnyonbe-20&linkId=5CQKRKP4JZOVHJOD\" target=\"_blank\">The Physical World [+digital booklet]this album<\/a>, which is the one that you can see in the picture.

While I'm sure the celebrities that I've seen listed are quite famous, their names mostly mean nothing to me.<\/li><li>Aren't a lot of these naked pics of really young women?  I know eighteen is legal, but I'm of an age where looking at naked eighteen year old girls would rightly make me feel like a dirty old man.  It won't be long before the little girl children of my friends who I carried around as babies will be that old.

I'll meet you back here.\r\n\r\n<em>Wednesday, June 18 - Thursday, June 19<\/em>\r\n\r\nWhen we last checked in with our intrepid voyagers on Velvet Elvis, they were at a nice little anchorage at about the spot where the civilized Florida coast dissappears for good.

Winds were light and progress was slow, but there were no real mishaps.  V continued to fight seasickness, but he slept all night in the cockpit.  Then, he followed that by sleeping most of the day.\r\n\r\nWe had planned to go all the way to St. Petersburg, but with dusk approaching and us having still several hours to go, we found a calm anchorage outside of Tarpon Springs.  The water was a beautiful deep turquoise, and the spot we found was deliciously free of other boats.\r\n\r\n<em>Friday, June 20<\/em>\r\n\r\nWe started early again on Friday morning, and had a coastal sail of just a few hours.  The wind was good early, and we didn't have to start the motor until we were out in front of the tourist boats and results of St. Petersburg.  We motored the last little while, entering the bay though a long cut with light sandy shallow water on each side.  \r\n\r\nThere was a little marina where we had planned to stay, a mile or so South of the resort where the Linkins would be staying.  Once we checked it out though, we decided to refuel, and then motor up the bay and just anchor even closer.  The marina really had nothing to offer.\r\n\r\n<a class=\"lightview alignright\" href=\"http:\/\/theskinnyonbenny.com\/img\/gal\/114%20-%202014%20Vacation%20-%20South%20Florida\/resIMG_20140621_163936_2556.JPG\" data-lightview-caption=\"Kolya dancing with a mermaid.\" data-lightview-group=\"group1\"><img src=\"http:\/\/theskinnyonbenny.com\/img\/gal\/114%20-%202014%20Vacation%20-%20South%20Florida\/resIMG_20140621_163936_2556.JPG\" alt=\"http:\/\/theskinnyonbenny.com\/img\/gal\/114%20-%202014%20Vacation%20-%20South%20Florida\/resIMG_20140621_163936_2556.JPG\" width=\"200px\"><br><span class=\"caption alignleft\">Kolya dancing with a mermaid.<\/span><\/a>\r\n\r\nWe found a pretty little anchorage, and to one end was a dock where sailboats take tourits out to see dolphins.  They were nice enough to let us tie our dinghy there while we walked up to the resorts to play.  There were also groceries and a drugstore right there, so it was most convenient.\r\n\r\nWe made our way to the resort, ordered lunch, and found the Linkins.  A nice concierge heard my story and gave me passes to use the pools and amenities.\r\n\r\nAs is usual for a beach trip, the stories are best told by the pictures, so be sure to <a href=\"http:\/\/theskinnyonbenny.com\/pg4.php?spgmGal=114%20-%202014%20Vacation%20-%20South%20Florida\">check those out<\/a>.\r\n\r\n<em>Saturday, June 21<\/em>\r\n\r\nSaturday was a pretty normal, lazy beach and pool day.  Late afternoon, we went in to get ready to walk down to dinner, and Kolya treated us to an energetic dance with an inflatible mermaid.  Mrs. theskinnyonbenny changed clothes in a closet, and Vanya crushed hard on a girl who will consider him much too young until he is 22 and she is 27.\r\n\r\nMrs. theskinnyonbenny had a beachfront restaurant in mind a mile or so down the beach, and walking down in the early evening gave us the opportunity to pass behind a couple of weddings.  I wanted to be disruptive without being obnoxious or vulgar, so I settled on passing behind the wedding trellis while walking like an Egyption.  I was most pleased to have V and Jake join me.\r\n\r\nWe drank and laughed through dinner, and then we walked past our part of the resort to a different building where they were having some sort of \"party.\"  It was really just a pool and a big outside bar that was open, along with a lot of communal seating.  We sat around and made friends with strangers while the kids did their own thing, and then we called it a night.\r\n\r\n<em>Sunday, June 22<\/em>\r\n\r\n<a class=\"lightview alignright\" href=\"\/img\/gal\/114%20-%202014%20Vacation%20-%20South%20Florida\/resIMG_20140621_190542_2614.JPG\" data-lightview-caption=\"\" data-lightview-group=\"group1\"><img src=\"\/img\/gal\/114%20-%202014%20Vacation%20-%20South%20Florida\/resIMG_20140621_190542_2614.JPG\" alt=\"\/img\/gal\/114%20-%202014%20Vacation%20-%20South%20Florida\/resIMG_20140621_190542_2614.JPG\" width=\"350px\"><br><span class=\"caption alignleft\"><\/span><\/a>\r\n\r\nAnother beach\/pool\/bar day.  The only noteworthy event I can remember is this:  Crystal was lying around a cabana, not moving, but mentioning every 20 minutes or so that we should feed the kids lunch.  Mrs. theskinnyonbenny finally got annoyed and walked up to buy sandwhiches and pizza.  She returned a long while later, and food was distributed to all of the young beggars.\r\n\r\nI was trying to fall asleep, but I couldn't do with with all of the commotion.  I finally sat up and accepted a piece of pizza.  Then, while looking to my side in conversation, a damned seagull swooped down, pecked me in the hand, and flew off with my pizza.  \r\n\r\nAfter that, Kolya would charge the birds screaming loudly as they came near, but they seemed almost as big as he was.  No doubt that they were planning to team up and eat the little brown kid.\r\n\r\nThis episode was still playing out in my mind some weeks later:\r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\"><p>As far as I&#39;m concerned, all insects and seagulls can go fuck themselves.<\/p>&mdash; Ben Schultz (@bens4lsu) <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/bens4lsu\/statuses\/494176063228878848\">July 29, 2014<\/a><\/blockquote>\r\n<script async src=\"\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script>\r\n\r\nLater, the whole crew came out to Velvet Elvis, and we motored around to Downtown St. Petersburg.  We got down there around dark and had dinner overlooking the marina.\r\n\r\n<em>Monday, June 23<\/em>\r\n\r\nThe next day, I spent the a lot of the day at the marina with some work and some boat maintenance.  I got out to the resort and to the beach.  I walked down to the place we had eaten the previous night and enjoyed some cocktail time all by myself.  It was a much-needed respite.\r\n\r\nThat night, we hit a restaurant down the beach that had this giant aquarium built by the reality show crew.  It was sort of cool.  Then, we played outside in the dark, knowing that this was the last time we would see our friends for many months.\r\n\r\n<em>Tuesday, June 24<\/em>\r\n\r\n<a class=\"lightview alignright\" href=\"\/img\/gal\/114%20-%202014%20Vacation%20-%20South%20Florida\/resIMG_20140624_093010_2793.JPG\" data-lightview-caption=\"\" data-lightview-group=\"group1\"><img src=\"\/img\/gal\/114%20-%202014%20Vacation%20-%20South%20Florida\/resIMG_20140624_093010_2793.JPG\" alt=\"\/img\/gal\/114%20-%202014%20Vacation%20-%20South%20Florida\/resIMG_20140624_093010_2793.JPG\" width=\"200px\"><br><span class=\"caption alignleft\"><\/span><\/a>\r\n\r\nTuesday was our day long Disney World marathon.  The plan was to get up early, drive there in time to open the park, let K meet Mickey Mouse and maybe one of the princesses from Frozen, ride some rides, and get back home.\r\n\r\nOf that, we got up early, and we rode some rides.\r\n\r\nI don't want to be too negative, but even getting there soon after the park opened, it was crowded and hot enough to swampify the crotch of the shorts.  There were definitely some fun moments, especially for the kids, but I have no idea how people spend day after day out there.\r\n\r\nAt the end of our long, tiring day, we drove back out to the marina and rested up.\r\n\r\n<em>Wednesday, June 25 - Sunday, June 29<\/em>\r\n\r\nMy dad came down Wednesday afternoon, and shortly after he arrived, we shoved off and headed West.  By sunset, we were out of sight of land. We worked night shifts of three hours on, six hours off, and it really couldn't have been easier.  For the first two days, wind was light to nonexistent, and we had to motor a lot.  But after that, it filled in just as forecast.  By Saturday night, we were flying along at breakneck pace.\r\n\r\nWe saw lots of little flying fish and a huge pod of dolphins.  The dolphins darted all around, and the water was clear enough to let us watch them zig and zag under water.\r\n\r\nI also had one night where the boat was rising up gently and settling back down into its bow wave.  As it sunk down, it would throw a gentle wave of water off to the side, and that water would light up with bio-luminescent plankton.  Really cool stuff.\r\n\r\nThere was lots of reading, lots of sweat, and one epic water gun fight in the middle of the Gulf of Mexico.  \r\n\r\nWe made it home Sunday morning and spent the rest of the day cleaning up and getting ourselves back to Baton Rouge.\r\n\r\nWe ate frozen and boxed prepped foods, and out there, they were good.  \r\n\r\n<em>In case you were skimming, the whole photo gallery is <a href=\"http:\/\/theskinnyonbenny.com\/pg4.php?spgmGal=114%20-%202014%20Vacation%20-%20South%20Florida\">here<\/a>.\r\n"

It's been a long time since we've hung with so many gnats and mosquitos, and they stuck with us for at least an hour.  Then, in a scene right out of a cartoon movie, and army of dragonflies showed up and ran them off.  The dragonflies stayed around for a long time too, and there must have been a couple of dozen flying along and resting on the lifelines.  We didn't mind them, and the boys got out the net to practice insect catch and release.\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\r\nWe sailed all day, nicely if not quickly.  We went South of the Mississippi barrier islands, and spent the day ducking and dodging the fishing fleet.  We had a couple of groups of dolphins come check us out, but none of them stayed around for very long.  It was a very pretty sail.\r\n\r\n<a class=\"lightview alignright\" href=\"http:\/\/theskinnyonbenny.com\/img\/gal\/113%20-%202014%20Vacation%20-%20Northern%20Gulf%20Coast\/resIMG_20140615_131220_2315.JPG\" data-lightview-caption=\"V at Sea\r\n\" data-lightview-group=\"group1\"><img src=\"http:\/\/theskinnyonbenny.com\/img\/gal\/113%20-%202014%20Vacation%20-%20Northern%20Gulf%20Coast\/resIMG_20140615_131220_2315.JPG\" alt=\"http:\/\/theskinnyonbenny.com\/img\/gal\/113%20-%202014%20Vacation%20-%20Northern%20Gulf%20Coast\/resIMG_20140615_131220_2315.JPG\" width=\"350px\"><br><span class=\"caption alignright\">V at Sea<\/span><\/a>\r\n\r\nI discovered one problem with sailing East:  The afternoon sun dips below the bimini and hits you directly in the back.  I was actually not planning to wear a shirt for several days, so having to put one on was most unwelcome.\r\n\r\nV got seasick late, so at dusk, we slid behind the last of the barrier islands and dropped anchor for the night.  Dinner was a box pasta dish and a frozen pizza.  \r\n\r\n<em>Sunday, June 15<\/em>\r\n\r\nWe motored behind Petit Bois island and turned out into the Gulf.  We sailed along pretty quickly for most of the morning.  In contrast to the beaches, the Alabama waterfront isn't nearly as pretty as Mississippi's.  We only had to avoid a few fishing boats, but the rigs were all over the place.  The final few hours of the day, we motored to Pensacola, as V was getting seasick again, and we wanted to stop at a marina and feel the ground under his feed for a little while.\r\n\r\n<a class=\"lightview alignright\" href=\"http:\/\/theskinnyonbenny.com\/img\/gal\/113%20-%202014%20Vacation%20-%20Northern%20Gulf%20Coast\/resIMG_20140616_184256_2399.JPG\" data-lightview-caption=\"The pictures aren't really matching up with the narrative in this post, but here's one from Monday of both kids and a heron.\r\n\" data-lightview-group=\"group1\"><img src=\"http:\/\/theskinnyonbenny.com\/img\/gal\/113%20-%202014%20Vacation%20-%20Northern%20Gulf%20Coast\/resIMG_20140616_184256_2399.JPG\" alt=\"http:\/\/theskinnyonbenny.com\/img\/gal\/113%20-%202014%20Vacation%20-%20Northern%20Gulf%20Coast\/resIMG_20140616_184256_2399.JPG\" width=\"350px\"><br><span class=\"caption alignright\" style=\"width:350px\">The pictures aren't really matching up with the narrative in this post, but here's one from Monday of both kids and a heron.\r\n<\/span><\/a>\r\n\r\nI had been feeling pretty good about my boat handling skills, and I pulled up to the fuel dock like a pro.  But then when we tried to take our slip, I fucked it up as badly as anyone really can.  We didn't sink, so there's that.  Perhaps it will be a funny tale one day with the passage of time, but for now, I'll leave it untold.\r\n\r\nWe had a pretty good dinner at a restaurant overlooking the marina.  Kolya experienced something similar to falling in love when he tried the twice-fried fries that they were serving.\r\n\r\nAfter that, I took a walk to pick up Dramamine -- an egregious oversight from our onboard first aid kit.  Our marina was in an area that they apparently refer to as \"downtown\", but it isn't the business district with the tall buildings that any other city would call downtown.  This was the original and oldest part of the city, and it was full of cool streets with old buildings turned into shops and restaurants.  \r\n\r\nI passed two wedding receptions, which I thought odd on a Sunday night.  One looked to be a classy affair.  I passed just as the young couple was cutting the cake.  The bride smeared some on her husband's nose, and his facial expression said, \"I can't believe how cute she is!\"  Bleh.\r\n\r\nThe second wedding was more of a redneck affair.  Most of the people were well dressed, but there was the guy who just put on his \"formal\" coboy hat.  Kids dragged each other by their legs across the dance floor while country music blared.  To top it off, a bridesmaid stood outside drunk and bawling around the corner from the front door.\r\n\r\nI'm very perceptive while I walk.\r\n\r\nThe cool part of town ends suddenly, and there's just the crappiest city in the world right beyond that.  I ducked into the first convenience store, make my buy, and got back to the boat.\r\n\r\n<em>Monday, June 16<\/em>\r\n\r\nWe're getting good at living aboard,  After leaving without incident, Mrs. theskinnyonbenny manned the helm, while I made eggs, hash browns, and coffee for everyone.  Breakfast was served just as we pulled out of the bay into the flattest, glassiest ocean that I've ever seen.  We got everyone dressed, teeth brushed, and settled into a couple of hours of motoring toward Destin.  V and Mrs. theskinnyonbenny are taking a nap, and K is using the iPad to draw pictures.  I've been able to get some work done and to update this text file.  Perhaps I'll even go ahead and post it!\r\n\r\n<em>Later<\/em>\r\n\r\n<a class=\"lightview alignright\" href=\"http:\/\/theskinnyonbenny.com\/img\/gal\/113%20-%202014%20Vacation%20-%20Northern%20Gulf%20Coast\/resIMG_20140616_164220_2376.JPG\" data-lightview-caption=\"Playing tourists in Destin.\r\n\" data-lightview-group=\"group1\"><img src=\"http:\/\/theskinnyonbenny.com\/img\/gal\/113%20-%202014%20Vacation%20-%20Northern%20Gulf%20Coast\/resIMG_20140616_164220_2376.JPG\" alt=\"http:\/\/theskinnyonbenny.com\/img\/gal\/113%20-%202014%20Vacation%20-%20Northern%20Gulf%20Coast\/resIMG_20140616_164220_2376.JPG\" width=\"350px\"><br><span class=\"caption alignright\">Playing tourists in Destin.\r\n<\/span><\/a>\r\n\r\nWe spent the evening and night in Destin Harbor, a good anchorage that is packed full of fishing charters, rentals, vacationers on jet skis, etc.  Had a good meal at one of the tourist traps on the water, then dinghyed over to the sand peninsula that protects the harbor and checked out wildlife.  We went back over there again after dark to look for crabs.  The kids caught a few hermit crabs, but we didn't see any biggies in the water.\r\n\r\nThat was a fun afternoon.  V spent a lot of time figuring out the nuances of the motor.  He's becoming a real seaman on this trip.  Since our docking mishap, he's asking about affects of the wind on the boat.  He's watching for other boats and taking care to avoid them by great margins.  I'm proud of him.\r\n\r\n<em>Tuesday, June 17<\/em>\r\n\r\nIt occurs to me that it might be hard to figure out what we're doing during the day.  There isn't really much to it.\r\n\r\nWe've been getting up at 5:00, stowing gear, and getting underway by 6:00.  We sail or motor or motor-sail for a while.  Kids wake up after an hour or two and appear sleepy-eyed.  I usually fix them breakfast, and then we all go up in the cockpit and watch the Florida coast slide by for many hours.  We read, listen to music, take naps, and just do our thing. \r\n\r\n<a class=\"lightview alignright\" href=\"http:\/\/theskinnyonbenny.com\/img\/gal\/113%20-%202014%20Vacation%20-%20Northern%20Gulf%20Coast\/resIMG_20140617_164110_1135.JPG\" data-lightview-caption=\"All set for that storm on the horizon. \r\n\" data-lightview-group=\"group1\"><img src=\"http:\/\/theskinnyonbenny.com\/img\/gal\/113%20-%202014%20Vacation%20-%20Northern%20Gulf%20Coast\/resIMG_20140617_164110_1135.JPG\" alt=\"http:\/\/theskinnyonbenny.com\/img\/gal\/113%20-%202014%20Vacation%20-%20Northern%20Gulf%20Coast\/resIMG_20140617_164110_1135.JPG\" width=\"350px\"><br><span class=\"caption alignright\">All set for that storm on the horizon.<\/span><\/a>\r\n\r\nThe kids' moods generally dictate the morale onboard.  When they're bright and cheerful, it's hard not to be the same, and when they're tired and whiny, the innate fatigue and whininess can be drawn out of any of us.\r\n\r\nWe had an easy sail today to an anchorage behind St. Joseph island (or is it a peninsula?) to the west of Appilachicola.  It couldn't be any nicer.  We anchored in clear, aqua colored water and dinghyed over to a deserted pristine beach lousy with wildlife.  I need to get a book of sea life to help me identify all of the things we saw.  There were a couple of other boats anchored together far away, but we didn't see or hear a soul.\r\n\r\n(I was going to stick the video in about here, but the pictures have this post all cluttered up.  I'll tack it on to the end of the post.)\r\n\r\nAt dark, we came back to the boat for hot dogs and noodles, followed by movie night on the laptop.  Our early mornings have meant that we don't spend much time after dark sitting up on deck and exercising our livers until the small hours.  We'll have to setp that up over the end of the trip.\r\n\r\n<em>Wednesday, June 18<\/em>\r\n\r\nWell, I guess I'm not going to get this posted promptly, as I haven't done it yet, and now we're out in the ocean without service.  You wouldn't believe how flat and calm it can be out here.  Motoring most of the day, as there's almost no wind, and what wind there is is right on our bow.  We saw a few more dolphins and some flying fish.  Nothing else really exciting to report for now.\r\n\r\nOur generator shut itself off last night with a warning about raw water intake.  It wouldn't be a big deal, except that the boat is still new, and I'm not 100% sure where its raw water strainer is.  While I'm searching, I need to find a piece of electronics that cotrols our AIS signal and get it configured.  Right now, we show up on our plotter as \"0\".  I found the sofware that does the configuration, but not the haradware that needs to be configured.\r\n\r\n<a class=\"lightview alignright\" href=\"http:\/\/theskinnyonbenny.com\/img\/gal\/113%20-%202014%20Vacation%20-%20Northern%20Gulf%20Coast\/resIMG_20140617_184834_2528.JPG\" data-lightview-caption=\"\" data-lightview-group=\"group1\"><img src=\"http:\/\/theskinnyonbenny.com\/img\/gal\/113%20-%202014%20Vacation%20-%20Northern%20Gulf%20Coast\/resIMG_20140617_184834_2528.JPG\" alt=\"http:\/\/theskinnyonbenny.com\/img\/gal\/113%20-%202014%20Vacation%20-%20Northern%20Gulf%20Coast\/resIMG_20140617_184834_2528.JPG\" width=\"350px\"><br><span class=\"caption alignright\"><\/span><\/a>\r\n\r\nOn a more pressing boat note, the vacuum that sucks the nasty bits out of the head has given up on its very short life.  Out here, I can pump it overboard instead of having it sucked into a tank, but it's a cumbersome process, and I'd like to just let everyone flush away their own \"black water,\" as the manual calls it.\r\n\r\nI've just about finished reading <i>All Fishermen Are Liars<\/i>, by John Gierach.  I like fly fishing a lot, even though I never actually participate in it.  If we were just drifting along slowly, I'd throw a line over to see if we could get anything.  I'd call it a must-read if you like fly fishing.  A should-read if you just like outdoorsy stories in general.\r\n\r\nThis passage is expected to last through the night.  We're planning to do three-hour watches.  I'm really hoping for watches under sail instead of with this wretched motor noise.\r\n\r\n<em>...but I need more!<\/em>\r\n\r\nLots more pictures from these days are <a href=\"http:\/\/theskinnyonbenny.com\/pg4.php?spgmGal=113%20-%202014%20Vacation%20-%20Northern%20Gulf%20Coast\">over here<\/a>.\r\n\r\nI'll do another post to finish out the trip one day soon.\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/99697885\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style=\"display:block;clear:both; margin-top:30px; margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;width:500px;\"><\/iframe>"

Part of me wants to laugh because I'm thinking of the lewd Floyd Cramer jokes that I used to make back when this commercial ran all day every day.  But I'm suppressing the laugh, because I know that Mrs. theskinnyonbenny will be thinking, \"Are you fucking kidding me?  He's laughing about Floyd Cramer penis jokes that weren't funny when he made them 20 years ago?\"\r\n\r\nThat might be the only drawback of marrying the person you were dating when you were nineteen.  You can't just brush off an old laugh with, \"Well, you really had to have been there.\"  She actually was there.\r\n\r\nAfter the song, the radio host explained that ol' Floyd started out with Louisiana Hayride, and that he was the session pianist for most of Elvis's hits along with tons of other rock and country acts back in the day.

We kill one another at a rate of more than one million per year, mostly wartime casualties. The second-deadliest threat is snakes, which kill over 100,000 people annually, followed by crocodiles (960), and tigers (740). The much-feared shark falls far down the listâ€”only about seven human victims annually worldwideâ€”making it a lightweight compared to the ostrich, which when cornered can kick viciously with hammerlike feet and sharp talons and kills some 14 people every year. As for the ferocious grizzly bear, it ranks about the same as mustelids (weasels, badgers, skunks, and the like), which kill an average of four humans a year, primarily pet ferrets attacking unattended babies. A couple more reassuring statistics: In the United States and Canada, you have more to fear from moose (six deaths per year) than any other creature except snakes (12). And the most likely place in the States to be attacked by an alligator (three deaths between 1992 and 1998) is not deep in some swamp, but on a golf course.<\/blockquote>\r\n\r\nAnd then on snakes,\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Snakes kill far more humans worldwide than any other animal, but as one authority states, they \"have never been shown to attack without provocation, despite lengthy historical commentary to the contrary.\" ...In the United States, by contrast, many victims are under the influence of alcohol or drugs and, in the words of another expert, are \"messing with\" the snakes. Researchers in Alabama have noted a statistical drop in venomous snakebites among adult men when University of Alabama or Auburn University football games are televised...<\/blockquote>\r\n\r\nAnd I haven't even gotten to the topic of the article -- the box jellyfish.\r\n\r\nGo ahead, go read it."

Itâ€™s all over the map â€“ from the quiet, dress-shirt wearing professional building to the noisy, jeans and t-shirt wearing software shops.  This month, I started a new thing at one of the quiet, professional type places.\r\n\r\n<table cellpadding=\"2\" align=\"right\"><tr><td width=\"5\" rowspan=\"2\"><spacer type=\"block\" width=\"5\" height=\"1\"><\/td><td width=\"250\" ><img src=\"\/img\/doorwindow.jpg\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td class=\"caption\" width=\"250\">The door-window.  I didn't have the nerve to take the picture from an angle where the woman who sits through there can see me.<\/td><\/tr><\/table>\r\n\r\nThe building is a typical office building, with an elevator lobby that has doors to two or three different companies.  The restrooms are also from a door in the lobby, and on my floor, the menâ€™s room is a nightmare.  There are two stalls and a urinal, crammed together along one wall.  One is a handicap stall, but the other is tight enough to bump each elbow on each side.  If I were 25 lbs heavier, I wouldnâ€™t be able to fit back there to the urinal at all.\r\n\r\nWhat makes it all the worse is that these three holes serve a whole office floor of men.  At first, I was never, never, never alone in there.  Iâ€™m hearing other people make the worst sounds in the world just inches away from me, while they hear me do the same.\r\n\r\nThen,  I discovered that the floor above mine is much more scarcely populated.  Itâ€™s been recently renovated.  There are still paint patches on the walls, and the air still smells like new carpet.  Best of all, the menâ€™s room was always empty.\r\n\r\nItâ€™s true that everything is a tradeoff.  I found my empty menâ€™s room, but at the cost of having the lady behind this door give me the stink-eye every day.  I appear in her window from her right â€“ where the only door is the one to the stairwell, and then she sees me walk away from her and into the menâ€™s room.  Then, weâ€™re face-to-face through her door window as I walk back.  \r\n\r\nHer expression is always far from friendly.\r\n\r\nYesterday, as I was coming out, in came the guy who sits at the desk next to me one floor below.  His face (and Iâ€™m sure mine too) was priceless â€“ the shock of being discovered dashing in for an illicit poo.\r\n"

Mrs. theskinnyonbenny considered our talents, and decided that my consistent ability to pull my pants ALL the way up above my butt crack wasn't impressive enough, so she listed me as a ukulele player.\r\n\r\nThe fact that I just had to look up the spelling of ukulele tells you all you need to know on that front.\r\n\r\nThey had a music unit scheduled a couple of weeks ago, and asked me to come by and sing.  I agreed, and I was immediately karmically rewarded with an ice storm that cancelled the day of school that I was supposed to appear.\r\n\r\nBut alas, they rescheduled, and today was the morning that I was meant to appear.  I procrastinated learning any kid songs until about an hour before my first preschooler gig.  I looked up the chords used when playing <a href=\"http:\/\/www.guitaretab.com\/p\/peter-paul-and-mary\/274621.html\" target=\"_blank\">Stewball<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/guitar.about.com\/od\/guitartab\/l\/bl-twinkle-twinkle-little-star.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Twinkle Twinkle<\/a>.  They were all ones that I could handle, so I sat in my car in the parking lot at work, ran through them a couple of times, and deemed myself ready.\r\n\r\nK wasn't enthusiastic about all of this.  In fact, when I dropped him off in the morning, he demanded that I not return for singing.  It would have been fine with me to honor his request, but then the teachers would pen me in as a flake.  I got there during snack time, and K just pretended that I was a stranger.  He came and grabbed my knee when snack was over, but when I made him sit down with his class, he was done with me.  \r\n\r\nWhen I would sing, he even covered his ears with his hands and shook his head no.\r\n\r\nLittle shit.\r\n\r\nI was thinking that two songs would be plenty, but I ran through them in about 90 seconds, and all of the teachers and kids just looked up at me expectantly for more.  I asked the kids what they wanted to sing, and when they answered, I told them to sing really loud.  They sang loud, and I strummed nonsense chords that didn't go with the songs at all.  We did this for three or four more songs.\r\n\r\nThen, I let them each strum the strings, the teachers made everyone pose for a picture with me, and I screeched out of there like my pants were on fire."

We re-confirm the food that was just ordered.  He immediately disappears, leaving the empty champagne bottle on the table.  I take a quick look around and then decide to just help myself to opening another bottle.  More gets poured, and more gets passed down.  Three tables are now openly laughing at the main who isn't fit to wait tables.<\/div>\r\n\r\n11:16 - \r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin-left:2.5em;\">We ask another waitress to make sure the kitchen really has our order.

Mrs. theskinnyonbenny asks the new girl whether the waiter was fired or passed out somewhere downstairs.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, he's just on drugs or something,\" she answered nonchalantly.  It was like you would answer, \"oh, he's just allergic to tomatoes.\"\r\n\r\nSpeaking of allergies, I think the answer that the restaurant owner would prefer is something like, \"we think he might be having a reaction to some medication.\"  That's what I would go with.<\/div>\r\n\r\n11:35 - \r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin-left:2.5em;\">Shelly and Mrs. theskinnyonbenny get their plates.

I find that a bitchy woman in a blue Jetta has boxed me in to the parking lot.  I interrupt her breakfast and make her move her car.  \r\n\r\nI hope she hates cold eggs.<\/div>\r\n\r\nI think I've made it all the way down here without naming the restaurant.  I won't.  Mostly this is because it's a great place with awesome food, and I've been there lots of times with much success.  But if you brunch in New Orleans and are curious, it's that pace right on the river in the Bywater neighborhood."

And of course, there had already been Boo at the Zoo and school Haloween stuff too.\r\n\r\nI was glad to get inside in time to see an epic ABC programming feaux-pas.  Right after Charlie Brown's Halloween ended, they went right into Grey's Anatomy, which started with a scene of two naked women waking up together.\r\n<!--more-->\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"**************\" src=\"\/img\/abcscreenshot.png\"\/><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"caption\">ABC Screen capture, about five seconds after the end of the Peanuts Halloween special.<\/p>\r\n\r\nMy kids didn't notice, and even if they had, they would have totally accepted an explaination where I shrug and say, \"Some grownups sleep nude.\"  And that would have been the end of it.  I like to think of it having lead to awkward discussion across America, but in most places, the kids were probably just getting in.\r\n\r\nVoodoo Festival followed, and we spent huge chunks of the day there Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. Picture perfect weather all three days. \r\n\r\nFor me, the most fun is the booze smuggle-in.\r\n\r\nOn Friday, I tucked a flask into my pants, and I waited for 10 minutes while the searcher checked jacket pockets, had me unfold blankets, and felt through every pocket of a roomy backpack.  Meanwhile, K tugged on the leg of my shorts asking, \"What's in Papa's balls?\"  \"What's in Papa's balls?\"  \"Is that whiskey in Papa's balls?\"\r\n\r\n<table cellpadding=\"2\" align=\"right\"><tr><td width=\"5\" rowspan=\"2\"><spacer type=\"block\" width=\"5\" height=\"1\"><\/td><td width=\"420\" ><img src=\"\/img\/kquarter.jpg\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td class=\"caption\" width=\"420\">Hanging out in the French Quarter<\/td><\/tr><\/table>\r\n\r\nThey should pay more attention.\r\n\r\nOn Saturday, I could have smuggled in a whole pharmacy of drugs and a couple of automatic weapons, as they guy clearly was from the school of belief that no middle aged guy with two little kids was going to do anything to rock the apple cart.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday, I noticed the line had the first waist and pant-leg patter that I had seen.  She was the only threat all weekend to whiskey confiscation.  I pulled off my backpack and used it to keep a distance between us as I started unrolling blankets and unzipping pockets.  She got tired of the ordeal before we were through it all, and sent me through without the body pat.\r\n\r\n<table cellpadding=\"2\" align=\"right\"><tr><td width=\"5\" rowspan=\"2\"><spacer type=\"block\" width=\"5\" height=\"1\"><\/td><td width=\"300\" ><img src=\"\/img\/vfly.jpg\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td class=\"caption\" width=\"300\">Taking flight at the festival.<\/td><\/tr><\/table>\r\n\r\nWe saw a lot of good music.  <a href=\"http:\/\/www.thevirginmarys.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">The Virginmarys<\/a> and the alt-country duo <a href=\"http:\/\/www.shovelsandrope.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Shovels and Rope<\/a> have a new fan over here.

I think it's the first show where he's really known a lot of the music that was playing.  K liked the Preservation Hall band, who got billing on the main stage, maybe for the same reason.  He definitely liked when we all chanted \"Who Dat.\"\r\n\r\nThe Cure, Cults, and The Weeks are all bands that I expected to be good and wasn't disappointed.\r\n\r\nWe went late on Sunday, and the first act we caught was Matt and Kim.  I expected a chilled, catchy set that would be a chance to relax before Kid Rock (who was not very impressive, I didn't think).  But they brought a ton of energy and really got the crowd into it, which is all the more impressive since it's just the two of them, and they're trapped behind a drum kit and a keyboard while the songs are playing.  It was a really great set.\r\n\r\nThe Kim of Matt and Kim really made an impression on Kolya.  He spent a half hour after their show asking \"Where Lady go?\" and \"When she come back?\"  That might or might not be a good sign, since she spent a lot of time standing on her bass drum, shaking her (very attractive) ass at the crowd, and then made a show of putting on a half dozen thongs that had hit the stage.  \r\n\r\n<table cellpadding=\"2\" align=\"right\"><tr><td width=\"5\" rowspan=\"2\"><spacer type=\"block\" width=\"5\" height=\"1\"><\/td><td width=\"400\" ><img src=\"\/img\/cure.jpg\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td class=\"caption\" width=\"400\">Who recognizes this older, fatter version of a rocker that you've known for 20 years?<\/td><\/tr><\/table>\r\n\r\n(They really were a lot of fun to watch.)\r\n\r\nA non-musical highlight of the festival was spotting Santa Claus entering a porto potty from the Ferris Wheel.  (Try to find that sentence written in any language, anywhere else, ever.)\r\n\r\nSanta was in there for a long while, and after he came out, I let the kids stalk him for a bit.  They decided that it was a guy in a costume rather than the real Santa, since he wouldn't look up at them from his Stella and his cell phone.  But by taking so long in the porto john, he introduced to our family the phrase, \"I gotta poo poo like Santa Claus\" as a way to emphasize a massive need.  I hope that one sticks around.\r\n\r\nWe also did some hanging around in the French Quarter.  If I post pictures from the weekend, you'll notice Vanya sporting a top hat.  \r\n\r\nAlso, Kolya found a hairy curler from some bowl of the hotel room and had it a millimeter from his mouth before I slapped it away.  \r\n\r\nGood weekend.  Can't wait for next year.\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"**************\" src=\"\/img\/vtophat.jpg\"\/><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"caption\" style=\"margin-left:105px;\">Waiting for the next act.<\/p>\r\n"

A great football Saturday, good food, nice whether -- it had everything I could want.\r\n\r\nSaturday morning, we went to the Wooden Boat Festival in Madisonville.  In my mind, it's more of a boat show than a boat festival, as no one was deep-frying Oreos near a stage full of fiddle players.  But who doesn't like a boat show?\r\n\r\nAt the far end of the show was a tent where old codgers help little kids build their own toy wooden boats.  The lane for boat builders were for kids only, but there was a path for grown ups to follow behind them.  \r\n<!--more-->\r\nBoth of our kids went through.  K picked out a catamaran hull, and V picked the biggest monohull that he could see.\r\n\r\nK stood in front of his old guy with his chin at table level and nodded yes to every question.\r\n\r\n\"Should I put a cabin on it?\"\r\n\r\nNod yes.\r\n\r\n\"How about some rudders?\"\r\n\r\nNod yes.\r\n\r\nSince he didn't actually do any of the hammering or gluing, he was done first.  I walked him around to the other side where women were stationed to enhance the boats with flags and sails.  He was dressed in an LSU jersey (it was game day, after all), so the woman gave him purple and gold sails and flags.  One more person added a little American flag flaying on the stern.  It was a nice looking boat.\r\n\r\nFrom there, you could exit past a giant tub, where kids could take their new boats for shake-out cruises.  K thought the goal was to sink his boat, and he did his best to keep it submerged.  Unfortunately, this was too much for the still new hot glue, and his boat lost one of its hulls.\r\n\r\nBy then, V had come around, and he had picked sails and flags of royal blue and orange.  This caused me no small amount of concern.  He picked Florida's exact colors just an hour before the LSU-Florida kickoff.  This from a kid who chose a red T-shirt the morning of the LSU-Georgia game, which didn' go as well as we had hoped.\r\n\r\nI was thinking that he had signle handedly cost LSU the game, and although I only mentioned it 1 of every 100 times it popped up in my head, he still fussed at me later about hurting his feelings when I \"made fun\" of his boat.\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"*************.\" src=\"\/img\/VandBoat.jpg\"\/><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"caption\">V and his horribly clueless sailboat.<\/p>\r\n\r\n"

First, my hand was steady enough to get this picture in about a .75 second exposure, and second, that the sensor was able to capture this picture with a .75 second exposure.  Yes, it's grainy.  But with my naked eye, it was too dard to read that speed limit sign at all.\r\n\r\nI followed Ward's Creek from the Capital Heights subdivision into Webb Park.

Before kids, I would have the house to myself, and I would stay up late every night watching Chevy Chase movies that I had seen 100 times before.  If anyone asked, I always reported that I sat on the couch naked as a jaybird, eating nonstop potato chips.  If my listener didn't look suitably disgusted, I would add that I filled my belly button with French Onion dip, so as not to have to wash a bowl.\r\n\r\nThis year, she went during a week that coincides with the kids' week up at Granny's farm.  It's the first time I've had the house to myself for several days straight since -- I think since we adopted V.  Christ, that's a long time.\r\n<!--more-->\r\nUnfortunately for my leisure time -- but fortunately for our empty bank account -- I have a couple of extra projects that will keep me busy with work.  Today, I had the most productive work day in a long time.  I started at 5:00 this morning, and kept at it through early evening.  Even during lunch, I picked up a sandwich and ran some tests for a part-time project.\r\n\r\nAfter I signed off for the day, I went on the longest run I've done in a long time.  And by long, I mean amount of time exercising -- not a long distance.  RunKeeper got confused, and had me running in odd zig-zag circles for a mile or more, so when I looked at <a href=\"http:\/\/runkeeper.com\/user\/bens4lsu\/activity\/217264571?&tripIdBase36=3lcqez\" target=\"_blank\">my results<\/a>, I about ripped off my shirt to strut about.  Then, I looked at the map, I saw that my stats were bogus, and that I'm still fat and slow.  But then again, it was scorching hot, and I feel good about how I did all the same.\r\n\r\nSince I was so healthy there, I went by the tobacco store and loaded up with cigars for the week.  If I knew I had only one pour of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.edradour.com\/index2.html\" target=\"_blank\">Edradour<\/a> left, I might have gone to the liquor store too.  Strange as it may seem, I've never bought my own liquor without explicit instruction.  \r\n\r\n<table align=\"right\" cellpadding=\"2\">\r\n<tbody><tr>\r\n<td rowspan=\"2\" width=\"5\"><spacer type=\"block\" width=\"5\" height=\"1\"><\/spacer><\/td>\r\n<td width=\"250\"><img src=\"http:\/\/theskinnyonbenny.com\/img\/liquorCabinet.jpg\" width=\"250\"><\/td>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td class=\"caption\" width=\"250\">I'm intimidated by our liquor cabinet.<\/td>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n<\/tbody><\/table>\r\n\r\nI often hear, \"We need Mount Gay and BT [Buffalo Trace] too,\" as I walk out the door to head to the grocery for a radish or a loaf of french bread.  For my second glass, I had to search the liquor cabinet, which is honestly a daunting task.  But I did find a bottle of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.aberlour.com\/en\" target=\"_blank\">Aberlour,<\/a> which I hadn't previously liked all that much.  On examination of the bottle, I saw that it isn't diluted between barrel and bottle, so I added more water than usual, and I found that it was much improved.\r\n\r\nAnyway, by the time I got home, cooled off, and ate a few bites, it was 9:00.  I got the exact same amount of TV time as I would have when the family was home.\r\n\r\nI started <i>Moonrise Kingdom<\/i>, which has been on my must-watch list since it was in theaters.  Wes Anderson, Bill Murray, Frances McDormand -- I'm in if you give me any of the three on a movie poster.  This one is a masterpiece.  It's available in HBOGo just through tomorrow -- probably today, since you're likely seeing this on Wednesday -- so catch it tonight if you get Wes Anderson movies and haven't seen it.  It's nothing short of a masterpiece.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know what your favorite grown-up movies have been over the past six years.  Besides MK, I've seen <i>Rise of the Planet of the Apes<\/i> and <i>Cloverfield<\/i> (which I also love).  \r\n\r\n(Don't go overboard, though.  I've got to find time to watch <i>Funny Farm<\/i> somewhere in here too.)\r\n\r\nMy Facebook update sums up my evening well, I think:  \r\n\r\n<blockquote>Had some hummus, a cigar, and scotch for dinner. If you equivocate hummus -> cheese ball, cigar -> cigarette, and scotch -> wine from a box, I truly have turned into my mother. <\/blockquote>\r\n\r\nDon't get me wrong.  I love my family like crazy.  But I really, really, treasure alone time.  It usually comes as little snips, an hour here, two hours there.  I couldn't be more ticked to have 5 days of alone time in front of me.  What, oh what, shall I do with myself?  Please don't offer to come hang out this weekend.  I love you, but I'm not interested.\r\n\r\nMy intention is to keep updating this post through the week (thus the date up top), so check back on me from time to time, if you're so inclined.\r\n\r\n<strong>July 31 -- 22:40<\/strong>\r\n\r\nSince we last met in this space, I've found several Easter eggs, strategically hidden throughout the house to remind me to think of my kids.  A ukelele under my desk.  A collection of hats on the patio table.  And not one, but two -- two -- toilets that needed to be flushed.  So, dear family, I am thinking of you.\r\n\r\nAfter a full work day, I took advantage of my chance to be alone by doing something you would never guess.  I watched someone else's kids.\r\n\r\nI really had a quick chat with two kids and read while they went off to swim.  I caught a couple of glimpses of them during the 90 minutes or so that I was there with them, but mainly, I was just a ride to the Emergency Room, should that become necessary.  Fortunately for us all, it didn't become necessary.\r\n\r\nIt was Eddie and Carmel's anniversary.  It's an occasion that I like to celebrate by finding a priest and picking a fight.  Those of you who attended the wedding will no doubt understand why.\r\n\r\nAfter that, I decided to continue my trend of grown up movies in an actual theater.  I saw <i>Pacific Rim<\/i>, and I wish I hadn't.  Too much people discussing what they think and not enough monsters crushing buildings and bridges.  And really, when the monsters do eventually rise from the ocean and start crushing our cities, I think we humans can do better than giant Rock-em Sock-em robots.  \r\n\r\n<strong>8\/2\/2013 10:37<\/strong>\r\n\r\nI posted nothing yesterday, because there is truly nothing to tell.  I worked a long day -- even through lunch, and then crashed on the couch.  By the time I work up, it was almost dark.  I did some DVR catch-up and was back asleep at some fairly reasonable hour.\r\n\r\nI have much higher hopes for an active, entertaining day today.  I have plans to meet a friend for dinner who I haven't seen in a really long time.  Hopefully, I'll come away from that with a good story or two.\r\n\r\n<strong>8\/2\/2013 23:36<\/strong>\r\n\r\nFun night.\r\n\r\nAfter work, I intended to go for a paddle.  I've been driving around with my kayak on top of the Jeep since Wednesday, and I haven't put it in the water yet.  Of course, it clouded up and started thundering as soon as I left the office.  I drove home, opened a book, and napped to a really nice thunderstorm.\r\n\r\nGood thing.  Ligtning struck a Cypress right in the lake where I was headed.  The tree shed a layer of bark and wood all the way down one side.  I doubt it will survive, but I'm glad we're talking about a tree and not a kayaker.\r\n\r\nThis left me in ideal nap weather.  I can't believe how much sleep I've gotten in the last 36 hours.  \r\n\r\nMy college friend Jared was passing through town this evening, so I met him, his daughter, his dad, his dad's wife, and his daughter at The Chimes.  It was so much fun to catch up, but way too short.\r\n\r\nAfter that, I came home, turned on the music, poured a gin and tonic, and lit a cigar.  Sharples came by for a minute to share the boys-only atmosphere.  I've laughed my ass off for the past few hours.\r\n\r\nI've also really enjoyed the music tonight.  The music -- unshackled from Mrs. theskinnyonbenny's playlists has entertained me with Prince, Tina Turner, Van Halen, and Guns N Roses.  Our music in the 80s was the best.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I'm really missing my kids.  Can't wait for them to get home.  \r\n\r\n<strong>8\/4\/3013 19:51<\/strong>\r\n\r\n<image style=\"margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; display:block; clear:both;\" src=\"\/img\/kayak1.jpg\" alt=\"kayak panorama\">\r\n\r\nI have to go back a little bit to catch up now.\r\n\r\nFriday, I started work early, and then left the office early to try to go for a quick paddle at the LSU lakes.  As soon as I got two blocks from the office, the sky got suddenly dark and started thundering.  I made the choice to go home and catch a nap instead, and it was a very wise decision.  A tree took a direct lightning strike right there in the lake where I would have been.  Scary.\r\n\r\nWhen evening arrived, my friend Jared rolled into town, so I met him and a couple of his family members for drinks and dinner.  I had to break the promise I had made to myself to not get fully dressed at any point during the weekend, but it was worth it for the laughs.\r\n\r\nAfter that, Sharples came by for a drink and a cigar.  We cut it off reasonably early, and I was out for the night an hour or two after that.\r\n\r\nSaturday morning arrived along with a little hangover.  That's really unusual for me, but it chased away with OJ and coffee.  \r\n\r\nI finally got out and got the kayak wet.  All week I had considered places to go, and one place I never considered was < href=\"http:\/\/www.crt.state.la.us\/parks\/icyprempt.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Cypremort Point<\/a>.  It just popped into my head as I headed off my street, so off I went.\r\n\r\n<table cellpadding=\"2\" align=\"right\">\r\n<tr>\r\n<td width=\"350\" ><img src=\"\/img\/kayak02.jpg\"><\/td>\r\n<td width=\"5\" rowspan=\"2\"><spacer type=\"block\" width=\"5\" height=\"1\"><\/td>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td class=\"caption\" width=\"350\">Bayou up in Shark Island, Vermillion Bay, LA.<\/td>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n<\/table>\r\n\r\nFrom the park, I paddled North, and went up into a couple of little bayous in the marsh.  I don't know when, if ever, I've padded in a prettier spot.  The marsh was alive with purple flowers and colorful birds, and fish danced and splashed around ever corner.\r\n\r\nWhat the fish didn't do was take a fly.  The water was shallow, and at the right angle, I could see some smallish redfish swimming at the surface.  I dropped some flies right in front of their nose, but they weren't fooled at all.  I might have stuck around and tried some smaller floating flies with some success, but casting was boring compared to paddling up into the marshes.\r\n\r\nWhen I returned to land, I read a little and tried to take a nap, without success.  I came back to Baton Rouge, grabbed a bite, and watched another grown-up movie.  It was a really nice day.\r\n\r\nThis morning, I cleaned the floors but good.  I've been wanting to clean them up and put on a coat of polish, but there are always kids and animals hanging around and messing things up.  So I hit it hard this morning.  \r\n\r\nTo celebrate my productivity, I went to our normal Sunday brunch spot to suck down a big plate of food and three mimosas.  A nap was called for after that excess, and since then -- well I can't really put my finger on what I've done since then.  Some photo org on the computer, some getting through DVR'd shows that I didn't think I'd bother with -- nothing real.\r\n\r\nThe noisy, bossy family should be home tomorrow!"

We were hanging out in a narrow space between the bar and the restroom doors.  \r\n\r\n(It sounds awful, but the atmosphere in there really is a lot of fun.)\r\n\r\nI went into the men's room and did my thing, and on my way out, I noticed that someone had abandoned a shot glass of some blue concoction on the sink.  \"How gross it would be to drink that,\" I thought.  To make it even grosser, I moved the cup from the side of the sink to the back of the toilet.\r\n<!--more-->\r\nMy standard offer for a dare is $1.  I like to phrase it as \"one whole dollar\" to make it sound like a more appealing offer.  It's a testament to how I was over-served earlier in the evening that I came out offering $100 to anyone who would drink the blue shot.\r\n\r\nSteve knows us well enough to know that I don't have $100.  I suppose the ATM will dole out that much money, but if it wouldn't, I would not even know how to go about getting $100.  So he went to theskinnyonbenny accounting department for confirmation on the $100 order.\r\n<table align=\"right\" cellpadding=\"2\">\r\n<tbody><tr>\r\n<td rowspan=\"2\" width=\"5\"><spacer type=\"block\" width=\"5\" height=\"1\"><\/spacer><\/td>\r\n<td width=\"300\"><img src=\"http:\/\/theskinnyonbenny.com\/img\/steve-jodi.jpg\" width=\"300\"><\/td>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td class=\"caption\" width=\"300\">Steve and Jodi at Erin Rose.<\/td>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n<\/tbody><\/table>\r\nMrs. theskinnyonbenny cut the offer by an order of magnitude.  Ten dollars.  I searched my pocket and only came up with a single.  That made the offer $11 to drink the shot.\r\n\r\nSteve was quick as a cat.  Before the idea could even settle, he had thrown open the bathroom door, grabbed the shot glass off the back of the commode, and downed it.  It was gone before he was even back facing us.\r\n\r\nHis wife had this face like she wasn't sure if he had just committed suicide.  I was laughing uncontrollably, and Mrs. theskinnyonbenny and Dave were lost in conversation, unaware that the dare had been accepted.  Steve had a suitably disgusted look on his face.\r\n\r\nAfter several moments of laughter, he spoke.  \"I think that was soap.\"\r\n\r\nI stuck a pinkie in the bottom of the shot glass that he was still holding.  I swiped the residue at the bottom, and brought my finger up to my nose.  Definitely soap.\r\n\r\nFor some reason, it was even funnier that he had done a shot of soap.  Even funnier than that was that his belly started to churn, and when he would burp, it smelled like clean dishes.\r\n\r\nI am told that he later vomited, and that it was nice-smelling, foamy vomit."

We moved along at a nice pace in a comfortable temperature for hours.  No close calls with tankers or fish sticks or anything.\r\n\r\nThe St. Michaels approach is a mess, and you really have to keep an eye on the nav markers, because a large patch of water that looks like deep open bay is in fact a sunken island, just a few feet deep.\r\n<!--more-->\r\n<table cellpadding=\"2\" align=\"right\"><tr><td width=\"5\" rowspan=\"2\"><spacer type=\"block\" width=\"5\" height=\"1\"><\/td><td width=\"250\" ><img src=\"http:\/\/theskinnyonbenny.com\/img\/gal\/103%20-%20Chesapeake%20Bay%20Sailing\/resIMG_20130702_125846_0388.JPG\" width=\"180\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td class=\"caption\" width=\"250\">The bosun takes care of his line handling duties.<\/td><\/tr><\/table>\r\n\r\nThe town's waterfront is nothing but dock space, and our marina guided us into a slip right in front of an outdoor bar that looked promising.  I got us checked in and took the kids to the pool, while Mrs. theskinnyonbenny found the laundry room.\r\n\r\nBy the time the laundry was done, it was raining again.  I, for one, was in a very sour mood when Mrs. theskinnyonbenny returned with a pile of still-wet laundry and needed me to fold it while all four of us sat cramped in a leaking 60 square-foot salon.\r\n\r\nThe rain cleared, and we took a walk around the bit of harbor to the biggest restaurant we could see -- the Crab Claw.  This particular place had been recommended before we left Louisiana, and with good reason.  Between us all, we had steamed clams, fried clams, crab cakes, well seasoned steamed crabs that were as big as footballs, a smoked dip with some sort of seafood, and several pints of local beer.  After that, my spirits were much improved.\r\n\r\n<strong>Day 4 - St Michaels<\/strong>\r\n\r\nThe next morning, we went back to town, under skie0s that didn't threaten rain at all.  We walked up and down their little street of shops, and then went to the Maritime Museum.  It's a good museum of all things boating and Chesapeake Bay, and I enjoyed it quite a bit.\r\n\r\n<table cellpadding=\"2\" align=\"right\"><tr><td width=\"5\" rowspan=\"2\"><spacer type=\"block\" width=\"5\" height=\"1\"><\/td><td width=\"250\" ><img src=\"http:\/\/theskinnyonbenny.com\/img\/gal\/103%20-%20Chesapeake%20Bay%20Sailing\/resIMG_20130703_100400_0092.JPG\" width=\"250\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td class=\"caption\" width=\"250\">A little anchorage in St. Michaels, from the lighthouse in the maritime museum.<\/td><\/tr><\/table>\r\n\r\nFrom the museum, I called the marina and asked if we could stick around into the afternoon hours.  The lady who answered was quite bitchy, and she said she couldn't possibly leave my slip occupied, as she had so many other boats coming in for the holiday weekend.  We went back to the marina, and Mrs. theskinnyonbenny and the kids hung out in the marina bar right by our boat while I washed a stream of potato chip crumbs and Cheerios out of the cockpit.\r\n\r\nWe didn't go far.  We rounded the point where the museum and the Crab Claw sit as neighbors and anchored in a pretty and protected little inlet on that side of town.  We gave ourselves a waterfront tour from the dinghy, and then tied up at the town's dinghy dock.\r\n\r\nAfter a quick lunch in town, we went back to the marina bar, which was pretty well swinging by now.  We met some nice locals, including an old couple who were pretty much just Jagermeister-swilling versions of my parents.  The place was full of dogs and even a cat, and everyone seemed to know each other by the time the sun was getting low.\r\n\r\nBy coincidence, we were sitting right in front of our vacated slip -- the one that couldn't possibly be occupied past 1:00 because of the huge influx of incoming boats.  It sat empty all day long, along with several others.  \r\n\r\n(I'd like to call her a name here, but this seems like a post that friends and family will read, so it seems a little inappropriate for me to include the word \"cunt.\"  So I'll just move on without calling her a name.)\r\n\r\nBack on our boat, we invited an anchor-neighbor over for cocktails.  She was a young single-handing female with monstrously hairy legs and lots of helpful local knowledge.  Far away, we could hear but not see a grad fireworks display.\r\n\r\n<strong>Day 5 - St Michaels to Oxford<\/strong>\r\n\r\n<table cellpadding=\"2\" align=\"right\"><tr><td width=\"5\" rowspan=\"2\"><spacer type=\"block\" width=\"5\" height=\"1\"><\/td><td width=\"250\" ><img src=\"http:\/\/theskinnyonbenny.com\/img\/gal\/103%20-%20Chesapeake%20Bay%20Sailing\/resIMG_20130704_154732_0118.JPG\" width=\"250\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td class=\"caption\" width=\"250\">Seafood restaurant in Oxford<\/td><\/tr><\/table>\r\n\r\nWe left St Michaels pretty early, but the wind was against us, so it was a long slog to Oxford.  There's a little straight known as Knapps Narrows, which was just barely deep enough for us to pass once the bridge tender opened up for us.  We might have even kicked up a little mud.  After that, we were able to turn off the motors and sail for a couple of hours.\r\n\r\nWe took a slip at a marina with power and wifi, but not much else.  Then, we tried to walk into\r\ntown, but there wasn't much town to see.  Lots of houses, but no cute little street of stores, and only 6 restaurants in the place.  \r\n\r\nWhile we ate another huge meal of clams and crab cakes, I checked the visitors guide and found\r\nthat the fireworks we heard on July 3rd were Oxford's.  Because of topography, we had traveled all day by water to cover what would have been a very short bike ride over land.\r\n\r\nIn retrospect, if you have July 4 as a holiday, it makes sense that July 3 is the day you keep people up to all hours drinking and shooting off fireworks.  But that never occurred to me as a possibility.\r\n\r\nI will say that it stays light for a very long time there in the Summer.  It was light until after 9:00, and in Oxford, that meant I was barely awake past sunset.  I think we all got 9 or 10 hours of sleep that night.\r\n\r\n<strong>Day 6 - Oxford to La Trappe Creek<\/strong>\r\n\r\nWe went to LaTrappe Creek because our guidebook made it sound off the beaten path.  And for Chesapeake Bay on a holiday weekend, it really was.  But we're used to having pretty little anchorages all to ourselves.  In fact, I've never shared an anchorage in Louisiana or Mississippi at all.  \r\n\r\n<table cellpadding=\"2\" align=\"right\"><tr><td width=\"5\" rowspan=\"2\"><spacer type=\"block\" width=\"5\" height=\"1\"><\/td><td width=\"250\" ><img src=\"http:\/\/theskinnyonbenny.com\/img\/gal\/103%20-%20Chesapeake%20Bay%20Sailing\/resIMG_20130705_175916_0225.JPG\" width=\"250\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td class=\"caption\" width=\"250\">La Trappe Creek<\/td><\/tr><\/table>\r\n\r\nNot much to tell, but a whole big portion of my pictures from the trip are from this day.  We motored up and down the \"river\", and then dragged the dinghy up on a sandy little beach to swim and play.  We had the beach to ourselves (even though we could see down river to a crowded one).  The water was nice and cold too.  Before dark, we were joined by a couple of other big sailboats, but they stayed reasonably far away from noisy from the noisy family on the charter boat.\r\n\r\n<strong>Day 7 - La Trappe Creek to Rhode River to Annapolis<\/strong>\r\n\r\nWe had a long way to go on this day, and we sailed for a long time.  But the wind was super-light, and we weren't making a lot of quick progress.  After a long, lazy sail, we motored the last couple of miles up the bay into the Rhode River.\r\n\r\nIt's a big inlet.  It looks nothing like a River at all.  \r\n\r\nIt is pretty, but on this holiday weekend, it was super crowded.  Without exaggeration, there were probably 75 sailboats at anchor, a half-dozen motor boats zipping around with tubers, and a couple of jet skis for good measure.  \r\n\r\nWe took the dinghy to a sandy spit to swim, but we saw a couple of healthy looking jellyfish right up by the shore and chose not to go.  The jellyfish in the Chesapeake are surprisingly numerous and large.\r\n\r\nBack on the boat, we found ourselves low on ice and mixers, and we decided to make the short motor back to our home marina.  There, we cooled off in the marina pool for a little while.  Then, we changed and went into town for -- take a guess -- crab cakes and steamed clams.\r\n\r\n<strong>Epilogue<\/strong>\r\n\r\nThe next day, we unloaded the boat, cleaned up, and went back into DC.  We found a Mexican place where we could have bottomless mimosas and brunch, and walked down to see a couple more monuments.  That night, we ordered pizza for the kids (me being still full of eggs, sausage, and cheese from brunch) and started reviewing pictures from our trip.\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"lighthouse again\" src=\"http:\/\/theskinnyonbenny.com\/img\/gal\/103%20-%20Chesapeake%20Bay%20Sailing\/resIMG_20130706_162938_0349.JPG\" width=\"180\"><img alt=\"baby at the mall\" src=\"http:\/\/theskinnyonbenny.com\/img\/gal\/103%20-%20Chesapeake%20Bay%20Sailing\/resIMG_20130707_161734_0363.JPG\" width=\"180\"\/><img alt=\"Lincoln Memorial\" src=\"http:\/\/theskinnyonbenny.com\/img\/gal\/103%20-%20Chesapeake%20Bay%20Sailing\/resIMG_20130707_170514_0385.JPG\" width=\"180\"><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"caption\" style=\"clear:both;\">Last pass of the lighthouse, and a couple of DC shots.  <a onclick=\"window.open('\/pg3.php?spgmGal=103%20-%20Chesapeake%20Bay%20Sailing','103ChesapeakeBaySailing','width=1024, height=768, toolbar=no, location = no, directories=no, menubar=no, resizable=yes, scrollbars=no');\" href=\"#\">See more pics<\/a>.\r\n<\/p>"

Take it.\"  We thanked her and gave the umbrella to Vanya.  Mrs. theskinnyonbenny had the diaper bag over her head.  I had Kolya over me, and he had on a large hat.  The two of us were pretty wet.\r\n\r\nBy the time we reached our hotel, it was pretty much done raining.  We were drenched, but not grouchy.  It was only later -- when I went to check the day's pictures -- that I noticed that my camera had gotten ruined by the water.\r\n\r\nThe next day was sunny, and we all walked out to the Air and Space museum.

We had a night in a hotel, which gave us a chance to go into town for touristy beers and crab cakes.  It put us in the mood to get out on the water.\r\n\r\nWe picked up our boat the morning of June 30th.  I let the guy walk me through the boat and chart briefings.  Nothing too unusual there.  I started loading our gear while Mrs. theskinnyonbenny went for prvosions.  It started to sprinkle.\r\n\r\n<table cellpadding=\"2\" align=\"right\"><tr><td width=\"5\" rowspan=\"2\"><spacer type=\"block\" width=\"5\" height=\"1\"><\/td><td width=\"250\" ><img src=\"http:\/\/theskinnyonbenny.com\/img\/gal\/103%20-%20Chesapeake%20Bay%20Sailing\/resIMG_20130629_160844_0242.JPG\" width=\"250\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td class=\"caption\" width=\"250\">V watching the cooks handle live crabs in Annapolis.<\/td><\/tr><\/table>\r\n\r\nOur guy at the marina must have had a rule that he had to see us out of the slip.  It's probably good that he did, because the way it was in there, you had to back the boat out, make a 90 degree turn, and then back down and around a navigation marker in order to go straight.  Screw it up, and you smash a large vessel on the opposite dock or go aground on a shallow spot just beside the channel.\r\n\r\nSo he was probably right to stick around and see us off, but it was obvious that he needed to get out of there too.  So out we went in a light rain.\r\n\r\nOnce I got out into the Chesapeake Bay inlet. it looked like a good move.  The dark clouds were over land.  Out in front of me was -- well, not clear sky, but not that bad a sky either.\r\n\r\nThe first view of the bay was amazing for a sailor who's used to seeing open, empty lake out in front of me.  There were dozens of boats.  Some were heading in, some heading out.  99% of them were large (40 ft and longer) sail boats, but there were random motor boats too, and at what appeared to be the other side of the bay, a huge container ship which could have run us down like stepping on a bug, without her captain ever noticing.\r\n\r\nAs I motored out, I was watching the rain reach the shore.  It picked up a little.  The wind was from behind me, so the drops started hitting my back.  I called down into the cabin for my rain jacket.\r\n\r\nAfter five or ten minutes of that, the storm hit properly.  I could see nothing but gray.  The boat rode comfortably over waves, but it was really rocking up and down.  Even though the motor was as low as it would go, and no sails were up, the wind pushed us at 7.5 kts.  That's really moving.  Now that it was a deluge, my rain jacket popped out of the hatch.  The rest of the family huddled in the cabin, getting wet themselves from windows in the cabin roof that were overdue for being reset.\r\n\r\nEven though I had just been in the middle of several boats, I suddenly couldn't see any of them at all.  I couldn't see land.  I couldn't see the Bay Bridge.  It had all just been right there, but now, it was nothing but gray.  I hoped that the other boats were moving parallel to me and at roughly the same speed.  I really hoped that there was no way that we could reach that container ship out there.\r\n\r\nWhen the rain cleared, the other boats were still close by, and we were still making our way out of the inlet.  I peeked down, and the rest of the family was huddled scared and wet in the setee.  I definitely had a lot more fun than they did.\r\n\r\nAfter that, we set the sails and went South.  We had talked about just passing through to the Rhode River, but once we got past the lighthouse, we still wanted to sail a little more.  We forged on to Harrington Bay, taking a slip for the night at Harrington Harbor South.\r\n\r\n<strong>Day 2:  Harrington Bay to Annapolis<\/strong>\r\n\r\nDid I just do a weird reverse copy and paste error on the destinations from the previous day entry?  Not at all.  On this day, we sailed back to Annapolis.\r\n\r\nHarrington Harbor South has its fans, and it's really not bad.  They have a pool, wifi, a band, and a restaurant.  But it's fairly well lacking in charm.\r\n\r\n<table cellpadding=\"2\" align=\"right\"><tr><td width=\"5\" rowspan=\"2\"><spacer type=\"block\" width=\"5\" height=\"1\"><\/td><td width=\"250\" ><img src=\"http:\/\/theskinnyonbenny.com\/img\/gal\/103%20-%20Chesapeake%20Bay%20Sailing\/resIMG_20130701_125056_0042.JPG\" width=\"250\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td class=\"caption\" width=\"250\">Thomas Point Lighthouse<\/td><\/tr><\/table>\r\n\r\nWe hung out all morning because, as you might have guessed by now, it was raining.  Showers were canceled because we had left the toiletry bag in the Annapolis hotel the previous morning.  So around mid-day, we set sail again -- this time in rain that was truly clearing away.\r\n\r\nOur return sail was uneventful.  We decided to go right into the downtown Annapolis harbor.  It's a little more exciting of a destination than our original marina, and mooring balls can be picked up for a fraction of the cost of a marina.  \r\n\r\n(Mooring balls float on top of the water but are anchored to the ground.  You just pick up the ball and tie up, and you're right there in the middle of town, bobbing comfortably in the breeze.)\r\n\r\nFor the first time in the trip, we took the dinghy out.  We gave ourselves a tour of the city's waterfront, passing way up the Spa River.  It's funny what Chesapeake people call rivers.  They're really just inlets.  Bays off of the main bay.  Maybe there isn't a good word for them, but they certainly aren't rivers.  \r\n\r\nOnce we tied up at the town dinghy dock (you're town gets extra cool points if it has a dinghy dock), we went for cocktails and ice cream, with the delineation being based entirely on age of the crew member.  I ditched the family to take the town shuttle back up to our hotel, where I retrieved our bag and forgot to tip the maid who brought it down.  I caught the next shuttle back downtown, and we headed to the showers at the harbormaster's office.\r\n\r\n<table cellpadding=\"2\" align=\"right\"><tr><td width=\"5\" rowspan=\"2\"><spacer type=\"block\" width=\"5\" height=\"1\"><\/td><td width=\"250\" ><img src=\"http:\/\/theskinnyonbenny.com\/img\/gal\/103%20-%20Chesapeake%20Bay%20Sailing\/resIMG_20130701_185612_0056.JPG\" width=\"180\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td class=\"caption\" width=\"250\">Annapolis evening, as seen from the harbor.<\/td><\/tr><\/table>\r\n\r\nOur last stop was the liquor store at the bottom of the main drag, where the owner was happy to haul a box of booze and ice out to our dinghy for us.  We were back aboard for a very nice sunset, with drinks and snacks in hand.\r\n\r\nA couple of other random tidbits from these days:\r\n\r\n<ul><li>Here and there, you'll be sailing in what should be good water, only to see it clogged up with thousands of close-together sticks, all in a line like a fence.  They must be related to fishing, and they aren't on the charts.  It's very annoying.<\/li>\r\n\r\n<li>When coming back into Annapolis, we were passed by a half dozen largeish boats coming from the Naval Academy.  They weren't huge naval vessels, but they would have made good sized luxury yachts.  They were gray and utilitarian looking.  Toy battleships, we figured.

Teachers that I remember as bad were the ones who were too passive to put us smart asses in our place when we needed to be, but even the couple of those who come to mind were nice people, doing their best in a room full of ungrateful, shitty kids.  I don't look back on them as bad teachers at all.\r\n\r\nWell, maybe one guy.\r\n<!--more-->\r\nI had Coach M. three times over the course of about 4 years.  I'll tell you two stories.\r\n\r\nOne year, in a Social Studies class, he made me apologize to the class through a bullhorn that he had brought in from baseball practice.  My crime was noisily passing gas during a \"work at your desk\" exercise.\r\n\r\nWe had been doing a unit on natural resources, and on one particular day, we were given a difficult circle the word puzzle with the names of several dozen natural resources.  We got through most of it, and everyone was stuck on the one or two that they couldn't find, and bored with the whole thing, we started comparing notes to get it finished.\r\n\r\nThe room started to fill with muffled conversation.\r\n\r\n\"Do you have solar?\"\r\n\r\n\"Going down and left from the top right.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you get coal?\"\r\n\r\nHell, maybe I should have paid more attention.  Writing this now, I can only think of a handful of natural resources.  I can't imagine how this circle the word could have taken up the last half of a class, but that's how I remember it.\r\n\r\nAnyway, my friend Culson was sitting right behind me, and he asked, \"Hey Ben, do you have Natural Gas?\"\r\n\r\nAnd that's when I let it rip.\r\n\r\nThe timing and volume were perfect.  And then, I couldn't stop myself from uncontrollable laughter.  For many minutes.  (I was a seventh grader.)\r\n\r\nI was admittedly very distracting, and it wasn't long before everyone was demanding to know what bit of hilarity they had missed.\r\n\r\nClass must have been just about over, because Coach M instructed me to go home and prepare an apology to be read to the class the next day.  That gave him a chance to bring the bullhorn in from wherever they hid baseball gear.\r\n\r\nSo that one's on me.\r\n\r\nBut a couple of years later, Coach M had the worst teaching episode that I remember.\r\n\r\nHe had been assigned a health class, and his room was moved out to a mobile-home turned classroom outside of the main school building.  \r\n\r\nOne day, our assignment was to write down what we didn't like about our bodies.  He would read them, but he would keep the information in the papers confidential.  He wanted us to be completely honest with ourselves.\r\n\r\nWe finished that, turned them in, and he started reading the papers as we went to work on something else.  Probably a circle-the-word page with all of the venereal diseases.  The room was quiet, and he would chime in every now and then with something like, \"You'll get there, Peterson.\"  I even got a \"Hang in there Schultzey.\"\r\n\r\nAnd then, he told us to listen as he started reading one of the papers aloud.  It was a very good piece of writing where the girl divulged her insecurities in a comical way.  He was praising the writing, and he didn't name the author, but the beet-red face of one student made it clear to all who was ashamed of her widening behind.\r\n\r\nAnd even though the tone was light-hearted, the room was silent.  It was certainly the most awkward situation I had witnessed up to that point.  I want to crawl under the Regal Beagle bar as I type this.\r\n\r\nI can't believe I learned what gonorrhea was from Coach M.  My notion of it is probably entirely wrong."

We got out there in time to have a beer and a sandwich before the music even started blaring from the stages, and by 1:00, Kolya was covered in the juice of red snow cone melt.  Come to think of it, I had one shoe full of red snow cone melt too.\r\n\r\nWe continued with a fun day â€“ drinks, music, craft tents â€“ all that good stuff.  In the early evening, it started to drizzle, and we headed out.\r\n<!--more-->\r\n<table class=\"alignright\" width=\"340px\"><tr><td><img src=\"\/img\/festival_face.jpg\" alt=\"benny - the link to this image is f\" width=\"320px\" \/><\/td><\/tr><tr><td class=\"caption\">Festival Face<\/td><\/tr><\/table>\r\n\r\nOn the way out of town, I mused, â€œIf we werenâ€™t filthy, Iâ€™d say letâ€™s go down to New Iberia for that place with the soft shell crab poboys that are so good.â€�  \r\n\r\nThis peaked Mrs. theskinnyonbennyâ€™s interest, but I didnâ€™t know the name of the place, whether it was open at night, or whether they even had soft shell crabs right now.  (Once, I went there and had to settle for an oyster po-boy.  Poor me.)\r\n\r\nBut she was determined, and after a few minutes on google, I confirmed a picture of the place (whose name I still donâ€™t know).  A quick call confirmed openness and availability of the crabs, so we turned right instead of left, and were off for an adventurous dinner.\r\n\r\nWhen we arrived, I handed the kids off and dashed into the bathroom.  Mrs. theskinnyonbenny stood at the front counter, and as soon as she opened her mouth to order, she felt warm urine running down her side.  Baby K pretty well soaked the side of her shirt, and had enough left over to leave a puddle in the front room.  But that wasnâ€™t the end of our puddles; not at all.\r\n\r\nI came back to the table after a diaper change, and Vanya and Mrs. theskinnyonbenny were seated with forks, napkins, and drinks.  As I pulled my chair up to sit, my elbow knocked into the table.  There must have been one excited instant where my elbow was moving at 50 miles per hour, and at peak speed, the collision with the table occurred.  \r\n\r\nThe impact was enough to knock over two full soft drinks, so ice and liquid gushed everywhere.  In short order, an employee showed up to mop, while I used napkins to brush ice and liquid into a giant trash can.  This process took forever.\r\n\r\nAbout that time, a stranger passed behind me and said, â€œExcuse me, I donâ€™t know if youâ€™re aware, but youâ€™re bleeding.â€�  Sure enough, my elbow was moving fast enough to break skin, and in the process of wiping up ice, I had smeared blood along the back of my arm from shirt sleeve to mid-forearm.  There were even a couple of puddles near the edge of the table near me.  I guess thatâ€™s where I rested my elbow to reach across to the far side.  So the table cleanup continued.\r\n\r\n<table class=\"alignright\" width=\"340px\"><tr><td><img src=\"\/img\/fanofshame.jpg\" alt=\"benny - the link to this image is f\" width=\"320px\" \/><\/td><\/tr><tr><td class=\"caption\">The fan of shame blows under the table.<\/td><\/tr><\/table>\r\n\r\nFinally, the mop girl felt like her effort was good enough.  She explained that they would get it better after they close, and they moved a fan to the floor to blow beneath our table and help it dry out.\r\n\r\nIf you think you have a mental picture of all of this, remember that we came into the restaurant filthy, filthy, filthy.\r\n\r\nMy final laugh of the trip was watching Kolya and Mrs. theskinnyonbenny share a catfish box.  Baby K wanted it all for himself, and would slap his motherâ€™s hand away when she would reach in to get a bite.  He did it over and over and over, and it made me laugh harder every time.  I finally pulled out my phone to get a video of the greedy little shit, but he decided then to be nice about it. \r\n"

I need to talk to Vic.\"  And she'd get someone to go find Vic (for example), and then when he answered, I'd just say, \"Peak t' Dee?\"  \r\n\r\nI couldn't imitate anything else they might say (or even guess what words they might say), so if questioned, I'd just repeat \"Peak t' Dee\" over and over and over."

Or I should say I did enjoy that, because it's ruined.\r\n\r\nIt all started back in October.  V gets excited for Halloween, and he gets excited for decorations, so he and Mrs. theskinnyonbenny spent some time decorating the house one Saturday.  There really wasn't too much -- some smelly rubber skeletons in the den, a couple of pumpkins, and a scary face hanging on the door where the Christmas wreath would go in more traditional decoration seasons.\r\n<!--more-->\r\nIt was the scary face that caused the trouble.  Although the main part of the face was only the size of a large Christmas wreath, it had some black yarn that hung down like a beard.\r\n\r\nIt just so happened that a few of the stands hung down far enough that they covered the mail slot, which is about belly-button high in the center of our front door.  It wasn't a lot.  One finger could push them out of the way.\r\n\r\nBut this caused trouble, because about the same time that Mrs. theskinnyonbenny and V were decorating, our mail lady was having a large stick embedded into her behind.  One day, she caught me in the driveway and told me that the decoration couldn't block the mail slot.  \r\n\r\nI said okay, but did nothing about it.\r\n\r\nShe caught Mrs. theskinnyonbenny a day or two later, and Mrs. theskinnyonbenny told her to deal with it.  She threatened to stop delivering our mail.\r\n\r\n\"That's fine.  Don't deliver it.\"\r\n\r\nSo some time around mid-October, we stopped getting mail through our slot.\r\n\r\nSome weeks later, Mrs. theskinnyonbenny was expecting something important.  Maybe it was a credit card -- we'll say that it was.  She went to the post office and stood in the line of people who need to be taught how to tape their packages shut.  \r\n\r\n\"I need to pick up our mail,\" she told the only clerk on duty during the lunch rush.\r\n\r\nThe lady took her information and then disappeared to the back for a very long time.  Eventually, another postal worker came out and asked for all of the same information.  Then she asked, \"Why do we have your mail?\"\r\n\r\nMrs. theskinnyonbenny told the story, and this woman disappeared to the back again for a very long time.\r\n\r\nA supervisor with an attitude was the next to come out.\r\n\r\n\"We don't have your mail.  We're returning it all to the senders.\"\r\n\r\n\"What!\"\r\n\r\n\"Your mail carrier told you this is what would happen.\"\r\n\r\n\"No she didn't!  She just said that you wouldn't deliver it to my house.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, we sent you a letter too.\"\r\n\r\nNo shit.  She really said that.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure how the rest of the conversation went, because at this point in the story, Mrs. theskinnyonbenny starts frothing at the mouth, and it makes her difficult to understand.\r\n\r\nI've taken a couple of calls from places that got mail returned.  For example, the vet's office wanted our new address for their reminder postcards.  Very important stuff.\r\n\r\nThe strangest reaction was from Sports Illustrated, who interpreted the returned magazines as a cancellation.  They cut off my iPad access, and sent a refund check for the unused portion of the subscription.  I had had that subscription since I was in 10th grade.  You would think they might give a customer of 25 years a quick phone call to see what's up.\r\n\r\nThis leaves me without magazines, which in turn leaves me without anything to read in my manly bubble baths.  I can't just lean back and look at the ceiling, and it's not practical to make a run to Walgreen's to buy a magazine at bath time.  It would take an amount of advance planning that I'm not ready to dedicate.\r\n\r\nSo my baths are ruined.\r\n\r\nAnd if you notice that I'm smelly, blame the Postal Service.\r\n\r\nStill to this day, they bear the time, effort, and expense to carry my mail out to my neighborhood every day, take it back to the post office, where someone else has to forward it to a different post office, so that a different mail carrier can deliver it to our office.  I know this, because when we occasionally have a substitute letter carrier, our mail comes through the slot as usual.  It's become a real surprise to walk through the front door and step on mail.\r\n\r\nAnd people wonder why they're hemorrhaging money."

I finally get past them and dart into a room.  I fail to find the missing item.  I turn to leave the room, and both boys who were up my ass for the second I was looking are in front of me again.  Stopped.\r\n\r\nUurgh.  It's maddening.  I'm going to bed before I burst a blood vessel.  (Also the Delete key acts like backspace on this contraption.)\r\n\r\n"

I pulled back into the street, and drove the mile or so to the CCs on Perkins road.  I normally avoid that shop.  It's on a narrow lot, and there's a ton of traffic, so it's always a nightmare just getting into and out of their parking lot.\r\n\r\nToday was no exception.  The car in front of me pulled in and stopped just into the concrete even though there was nothing in front of him.  This left me in the middle of a left turn and blocking a whole lane of oncoming traffic.  But eventually, I got into the lot.\r\n\r\nInstead of fighting for one of the precious few parking spots, I waited in the super-slow drive-thru line.  While I waited, a young driver of a U-Haul pulled up beside me, but across the divide, in the Sonic lot.  He was going against the flow of traffic, and perhaps this is why he strayed so far over in the lane.  He forgot about the roof height, and crunched into the Sonic parking cover with a massive crunch.  As he slowly backed out, there was more metal crunching and scraping noise.  Finally, the truck separated from the structure, leaving a section of dangling aluminum overhead.  \r\n\r\nWhy does it make me laugh when someone's weekend is ruined?\r\n\r\nHe sat for a little while.  I suppose he was trying to figure out how to dart out of the whole mess with so many onlookers about.  But eventually, he pulled to the back of the lot, and I can't deny that the more he sat, the more I enjoyed watching his distraught young face.\r\n\r\nFinally, he climbed up from the driver's side of the cab to inspect the damage to his rental truck, and as he turned to step onto the ground, I was able to read his t-shirt.  It was yellow with large green print:  \r\n\r\nI LOVE MY DUCKS.\r\n\r\nI'll take USC over Oregon this week.\r\n\r\nLock."

A cocktail or two in the back yard Friday night.  Went to Buffalo Wild Wings on Saturday to drink in the near-campus vibe and watch football.  A trip to the hardware store.  More football at home.  A little reading.\r\n\r\nSunday morning, I went for a run, then to Lucy's to watch the Saints.  Since I've done that two weeks in a row, and the Saints are 0 - 2, it's clearly time to find a better patio for Sunday brunch.  We followed that with a nap, and then... more nothing.\r\n\r\nMrs. theskinnyonbenny was about to go out of her head with boredom, but like I said, I'm an old man.

We were at an intersection of a street that intersects mine and a not-very-busy street one block to the North.  The not busy street is just a one-way number, and cars were spaced widely.\r\n\r\nBut the student driver would not go.  Huge gaps -- 20 to 30 seconds apart, without exaggeration -- passed while the driver waited and waited and waited.  I got progressively more irritated and gesticulated at the windshield, but the Student Driver status kept me off of the horn.\r\n\r\nWhen he\/she finally turned, there was of course plenty of room for me to make the crossing also.  As I passed through the intersection, I made a quick glance to my left, and spotted the student driver two houses up the street, but angled up into the homeowner's grass.  It appeared that the homeowner had backed out of his driveway, and instead of stopping, the student decided to take out part of his lawn.\r\n\r\nDo we all start out that bad?\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/img\/greenline.gif\" class=\"greenline\" alt=\"{{divider}}\" \/>\r\n\r\nThere are still some striking omissions from my iTunes library.  Most noticably, not all of my late 80s hair metal and early rap have made the transition from cassette tape to digital.  Want to hear Def Leopard at my house?  We'd better try to find it on Spotify.\r\n\r\nLast week, I added Afghan Whigs <i>Gentlemen<\/i> album.  I can't imagine what took so long.\r\n"

Marnie said that Power Rangers weren't real.\"\r\n\r\n\"She did?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah.  I had to tell her they were too real!\"\r\n\r\nRecounting the story was getting his dander up.  It must have been quite an argument.\r\n\r\n\"I'm going to go tell her again!\"\r\n<!--more-->\r\nI didn't have the heart to take Marnie's side.  It was just too recently that we were at Disney World, and he was skipping happily around, having met Mickey Mouse, not even considering that he might not be real.  It feels like I have about 10 minutes of childhood left, and if that means acknowledging the existence of dumb-shit Power Rangers, then that's what I do.\r\n\r\nIt's not really much different from all of you who teach your kids that the Old Testament is real.\r\n\r\nOkay, that was a cheap laugh line.  I acknowledge that we aren't likely to go 5000 years into the future and find that almost all of the world's major religions are built on a foundation of Power Rangers.  But at least if they were, that would explain why so many people in history were compelled to attack others who were content to live and let live.\r\n\r\nGetting back to the schoolyard, I told Vanya, \"Just tell her that you like Power Rangers, and what she thinks doesn't matter.\"  But I was thinking, \"Go tell that little killjoy that there's no such thing as Santa Claus, and then promptly forget that I mentioned it.\"\r\n\r\nVanya's at a different elementary school this year, and even though it's early, I have a good feeling about it.  The classes are really small, they don't seem to have anyone who's hell-bent on quashing his quirky individual style, and the kids do seem to be really nice.  He's told me all about the favorite characters of the boys who share his recess:  one likes Mario, one is nuts about Batman, and he's really seemed to click with a Kindergartener who likes all manner of Power Rangers and super heroes.  \r\n\r\nThere's no mention of My Little Pony, though.  And truth be told, that's probably been his #1 go-to cartoon this summer.  Either he hasn't noticed that they're all girls, or he doesn't care.  He's watched both seasons on Netflix several times through. \r\n\r\nOne last thought:  V definitely used the name Marnie, and that only means that there's a 50% chance that this is actually the girl's name.  But it reminds me of one of my favorite bits of trivia.  You probably don't know the name Marni Nixon, but she was the singing voice that the lead actresses lip-synced to in the movie versions of The King and I, West Side Story, and My Fair Lady.  That's a pretty amazing resume.  I can only assume that since she stayed behind the camera, her looks were as ugly as here singing was pretty. \r\n\r\n\r\n"

We had spent a couple of quick days in Destin to hang out with friends there, and we had a boat charter to start from Miami a couple of days later.  We planned one long, hard day of driving, which would give us a full day to see a little bit if Miami and to provision for the boat trip. \r\n<!--more-->\r\nWe had gotten a little blow-past from Tropical Storm Debby while we were in Destin.  We knew it had gone East, and that it had the potential to slow us down, but we were undeterred.\r\n\r\nFast forward, say, six hours or so.  I had gotten into the passenger seat, got connected to the internet, and was actually getting caught up on some work that needed to be done.  It was only a few minutes before I noticed that the air conditioning seemed to be blowing humid air.  Thirty minutes later, it was humid and warm.\r\n\r\nOpening the windows was an option, but an unappealing one, as we had caught up to the steady rain of the tropical storm.  But at least it wasn't piping hot, so we went back and forth between roasting and being wet.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, our body heat turned the wet hot air into fog, and it got closer and closer to impossible to see out of the fogged up window.  A toy animal was pressed into duty as in inside windshield wiper as I tried in vain to fix the air conditioner by turning it on and off repeatedly.\r\n\r\nAs we turned South onto Interstate 75, traffic came to a stop altogether.  And there we sat, in our foggy, wet, hot car, for about two and a half hours.  We also happened to be in an AT&T dead spot, so I couldn't go online and get any information (or entertainment).\r\n\r\nWhile we weren't moving, I let Vanya switch places with me.  I crammed into his booster in back, while he went up front and asked about the function of each and every button on the dash.  I let Kolya out of his car seat, opened the window, and let him shout \"HI\" to drivers who were lucky enough to inch past in the next lane.\r\n\r\nI eventually dozed off, neck craned to the side to fit my height between the booster seat and the ceiling of the car.  I woke to find us finally moving.  We had been stuck in the hot, damp car for two and a half hours.\r\n\r\nAfter driving at a decent pace for a while, we saw the most amazing rainbow that I've ever seen.  By that time I was driving, and we were still wet and hot, so it was too much effort to pull out a camera.  But the bands of color looked almost solid, like columns of color, and they seemed to be just yards away.  The rainbow stretched up and over the sky, and came down on the far horizon.  Then, it had a shadow double arching along its outside.  The shadow would have been amazing on its own, but with the main rainbow, we barely noticed.  \r\n\r\nIt hung with us for a long time, until the sun disappeared below the treeline, sapping it of it's light.\r\n\r\nIt took us at least four more hours to make it all the way to our hotel in Miami.  I have to give big credit to my kids, who suffered through the whole day with very, very little crying or complaining.  I would have never predicted such good behavior from either of them, much less from both of them together."

It's an odd hour to hoof it through one's neighborhood, since most people are in, but most haven't yet gotten to bed.  I get little half-second glimpses of their lives, through lit windows that show a snippit of interior to me while hiding my walk from them behind a dark reflection.\r\n\r\nMostly, I see flat screen TV's, and in the fall, there's usually a football game on.  Occasionally, I see something odd.  (Well, more than occasionally if you count the neighbors who have a full size trapeze in their front yard, but theirs is another story for another day.)\r\n<!--more-->\r\nToday, I came home and wrote a description of the house that struck me as most odd.  I still can't imagine why they had so many lights on at once.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\nWhat first caught my eye was the fact that every light in the house was ablaze.  Both stories had lots of tall windows, and every one had bright light pouring out into the street.  Even looking around the corner at the side of the house that stretched across the huge lot away from the sidewalk had long, tall, arched windows, and even those showed an interior with every single light turned on.\r\n\r\nThree older children sat on the front stoop, their silouettes contrasting sharply with the downstairs window to the left of the door.  I heard them talking, and I turned down my ipod to try to catch what they were saying, but as I did, their conversation stopped.  I could feel their eyes on my as I padded across their lawn on the uneven sidewalk.  \r\n\r\nA small cockroach scurried in front of me, but that's common in the Summer night, and neither dog nor man paid it any attention.\r\n\r\nOn the right side of the house, the bright windows framed a small dining room.  On one side of the table, a morbidly obese man talked while wearing a salmon colored shirt.  Across the table, and showing through a different window, was a thin man, who might have been wearing a tuxedo.  There was certainly a startched shirt and a bow tie, but no jacket was in evidence.\r\n\r\nI wanted to stop and watch -- what could this odd pair be doing, but I felt the eyes of the children watching and willing me to pass.  I was out of earshot when their conversation resumed.<\/blockquote>\r\n\r\nCome to think of it, when I mop the floors, I find that all of the lights are on by the time I'm done.  I guess I flick them on to see what I'm doing, and then back myself out of the room and out of reach of the switches because of the wet floors.  Maybe that's what was going on.  It would explain why the kids were sent out front, but not the weird scene in the dining room."

It was a good show -- not a great one -- but the shining star was whichever producer whose job is was to pick out music.  Week after week, they pulled music that matched the show and was awesome.

Have some questions about who to see live?  Theskinnyonbenny family can give you a couple of clues.\r\n\r\nAt Jazz Fest last week, Mrs. theskinnyonbenny came up with the idea for the Jazz Fest Julep:  buy a mint-flavored sno-ball, add smuggled in whiskey.  It's actually pretty good.  Not as good as a real mint julep, but a long, long bit better than the canned Miller Lite that you can buy at the tents.\r\n<!--more-->\r\n<table cellpadding=\"2\" align=\"right\"><tr><td width=\"5\" rowspan=\"2\"><spacer type=\"block\" width=\"5\" height=\"1\"><\/td><td width=\"250\" ><img src=\"\/img\/jazzfestjulep.jpg\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td class=\"caption\" width=\"250\">A Jazz Fest Julep<\/td><\/tr><\/table>\r\n\r\nThe smuggled in whiskey is a piece of cake when you're traveling with a baby.  Suff it in a bag covered with bibs and diapers and other random baby shit, then tuck that at the bottom of the stroller, where it's a pain to get to anyway.  They didn't even bother checking in there.\r\n\r\nThe funniest part of that is that Mrs. theskinnyonbenny left a half-drank bottle of Makers Mark in the bottom of the diaper bag, and then left the diaper bag in her mother's car.  It will look to her mother like it's in there for the occasional belt while watching the kids at the park.  And if she notices it's there, and if she asks about it, I'm totally pretending that it's news to me.\r\n\r\nThe big act that we caught at Jazz Fest was Florence and the Machine.  The family enjoyed the show, but I was -- and I continue to be -- bitter that she didn't do \"Kiss with a Fist.\"  It's one thing if Springsteen doesn't get to one of his hits.  He has a 30 year library of tunes.  Can't get to them all.  \r\n\r\nI know that \"Kiss\" isn't in the style of all of her other songs, but it's her best.  In fact, part of my rationale for heading away from the Jimmy Buffet stage was that the average Buffet song might be better than the average tune from Flo, but none of his would be as good as \"Kiss with a Fist.\"  Listen to it without any preconceived notion about Flo's music, and you'll just think a random punk rock band came up with the perfect punk rock song.  I'd post it now, but I'll save that for Music Friday this week.\r\n\r\nWhen we left, Mrs. theskinnyonbenny mentioned that she hoped to find a place to eat on the way back to the car.  I replied that she must have been sitting too close to a pot-smoker.  No way the small little places near the Fairgrounds would have a table as 100,000 made their way out of the festival at the same time.\r\n\r\nSo of course, we get to the little Italian place on Esplanade next door to Cafe Degas, and their patio is full of empty tables.\r\n\r\nWe sat down, and through a gate at the back of their patio, we hear and kind of see a little local brass band cranking out tunes.  There seemed to be a lot of people back there enjoying the show, so I took the kids back there while we waited for our food.\r\n\r\nThe video I made over there is one of my favorites.  And it explains better than I ever could why I wouldn't want to live too far from New Orleans.  I don't think a scene like this would happen anywhere else.\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"http:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/41733084\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen><\/iframe>\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Then, the quick high notes of the guitar get added, letting you hear whether your new setup will play them crisply, or whether the sounds sort of bleed into a poppy mess (like they do in my kitchen, unfortunately).\r\n<!--more-->\r\nThe opening isn't as audibly pleasing in the video, as voices and crowd noise lay on top of the original music, but it's a great video; it's one that I distinctly remember watching on MTV in those lazy summer days when MTV played videos all day long, and I was still a year or two too young for the freedom afforded by a driver's license.\r\n\r\n<iframe width=\"420\" height=\"315\" src=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/GzZWSrr5wFI\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>"

		"post_content" : "I just can't seem to bring myself to watch this week's episode of <i>The Killing<\/i>.  I haven't decided to make the step of \"firing\" it (which is when I delete the TIVO subscription for it to auto-record), but it's definitely on paid leave.\r\n\r\nI wasn't one of the viewers that was very upset with the fact that they didn't solve the murder on the finale to season one.  In fact, I stubbornly continued to think that despite the forged evidence, they had the right guy.  But of course, they didn't.  We had to set up a whole season of tail-chasing so that we can finally find out who the murderer is at the end of the second season.\r\n\r\nAnd that's the jist of the problem with this show.  Two seasons is too long to solve one crime.  Especially since it's a run of the mill murder that every other show would have knocked out in an hour, with time left to spare for witty banter and a clueless lieutenant who spends his time demanding that his star detectives turn in their gun and badge.\r\n<!--more-->\r\nThere are no star detectives in this show.  And there is no shining light guiding this fictional version of the Seattle police either.  Linden was supposed to move away, didn't, and now she gets to work side-by-side with her replacement.  Is there no one who looks at the homicide department personnel budget?  Perhaps they're well under budget, given the competence of our two main characters.  It's becoming harder and harder to ignore the holes that they step around week after week.  Victims father has mob connections?  Ah, we'll look into that next season.  Employees who worked in the house where they live?  Can't interview them all right away.  Councilman Richmond gets emails from the victim's prostitute email?  Well, doesn't matter -- we cooked up evidence against him, so he couldn't have any new information to add, right?\r\n\r\nSo, yes, the police homicide department is the worst in the world, which is fitting for a family that has the worst parents in the world.  If your daughter lives under your roof, goes to high school by day, and is a prostitute on weekends, you're about 15 years too late for the parenting course that you badly needed to take.  When a tragedy strikes your family, it's best to show a smidgeon of attention and caring on the remaining children.  And also, disappearing on your family to boink strangers in seedy motels for some number of days is hardly the way to nurture even the best of families.\r\n\r\nBut besides the world's worst homicide detectives and parents, what's so wrong with this place?  How about the world's worst school?  Remember the sex dungeon in the school's basement?  As I recall, the principal knew it was there, but assumed that it had fallen into disuse.  I can't even think of anything to add.\r\n\r\nLet's not forget the worst doctor in the world.  Sure, Richmond looks pretty good for a recent gunshot victim fighting for his life, but I don't think most medical schools recommend letting your patients figure out for themselves that they're paralyzed.\r\n\r\nAnd to top it off -- and this one is obvious if you've watched -- we have the worst weather in the country.  It's usually dark, almost always raining, and if I see one more second of bulky wool sweater, I'm going to scratch my skin from the psycho-sympathetic itching."

If you watch it, you like it, but you can't really describe anything that is particularly likeable.  Maybe I can look into that phenomenon for you in a future post, but now, I'm going to give you an example about what is so good about <i>Mad Men<\/i>.\r\n<!--more-->\r\nI watched this week's episode on Sunday night.  One of the plot points was that Betty Draper Iforgethernewlastname is a lot heftier than she was when we last saw her.  Her doctor found some sort of abnormality in her neck, which rolled into a Betty Cancer scare.  \r\n\r\nIn once scene, she runs into an old acquaintance at the cancer doctor's office, and they end up going to lunch.  While at lunch with her fellow cancer patient, she says gloomily, \"I've got the only kind that makes you fat.\"\r\n\r\nAt the time it played, it struck me as humorous.  I didn't chuckle out loud, but on the inside, I was momentarily amused.  It took until today -- four days later -- for me to realize that I witnessed a little slice of TV writing genius.  In this one line, we instantly know that Betty's self-centeredness is as strong as ever.  She doesn't think of her kids, her husband, or the things that cancer might keep her from in life.  She certainly doesn't consider the feelings of her friend across the table.  She just worries about getting fat.\r\n\r\nFast forward to the last scene, where Betty finishes her ice cream and then finishes Sally's ice cream once she's alone in the kitchen.  I've used the visual of fat Betty going for ice cream number 2 to help stifle my own gorging on junk impulses this week.  Next time you see me chowing down on an inordinate amount of junk food, just call me Betty.\r\n\r\n(I know.  I brought it around to me.  I hope I can get one of those thinning diseases.)"

The Chandlers live in Minnesota, but the old man of the clan -- one JC of a famous \"now we're going to run around the Chi-O house with no pants!\" incident when he was between college girlfriends -- is from the area, and he knew that the Mamou Mardi Gras was an experience for his family not to miss.\r\n\r\nIt's something we've always talked about doing too, so finding someone who knew where to go and what to do seemed good.

If you're interested, <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Courir_de_Mardi_Gras\" target=\"_blank\">the Wikipedia article<\/a> has as much information about it as I would be able to give, without being too detailed, as Wiki articles can be sometimes.\r\n\r\nAfter we parked in Mamou, we walked to the Rozas's house, which is the parental home of a guy I haven't seen in 15 years.  Or, I might have seen him at a football game or something once every 5 or 6 years, but at any rate, it was very hospitable for them to take us in and let my fat baby eat their gumbo.  (It was really good, too).\r\n\r\nAfter that, we wandered out to the town's main drag, where people flittered in and out of bars, waiting for the dunks on horses to bring their collected gumbo ingredients into town.  This is one of the most fantastic places that I've ever stood around to watch people.  It's a great merger of Cajun and Redneck, white trash and white trash wannabes.  All manner of dress and all of the various accents in the state are covered.  We waited around from about 2:00 until about 5:00 before the group came back into town, but it went by fairly quickly.\r\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; padding-top:30px;\"><p><img alt=\"kids raising their hands\" src=\"\/img\/raisehand.jpg\"\/><\/p><p class=\"caption\" style=\"text-align:center; margin-left:100px;margin-right:100px;\">It appears that the age range for an enthusiastic response to \"Raise your hand if you're having fun!\" is limited.<\/p><\/div>\r\nI know that the idea is that they come back into town with all of the makings for a big gumbo, but the hour is too late and the participants are much too drunk to start a gumbo.

One float makes fun of shoes, one float makes fun of the St. Aug band, one float makes fun of secret themes, one float makes fun of Elvi on scooters, one float makes fun of the 610 Stompers, one float makes fun of women in fake naked suits on horses, one float makes fun of fiber optic light up butterflies, ...  You get the idea.  \r\n\r\nHow about one making fun of flambeaus called \"Flam-blows\" depicting flambeaus blowing themselves up.

Don't see those very much.  They seem to have been replaced by stuffed animals, and believe me, any parade goers with cute kids has as many as they could ever need."

I figured that someone started a bandanna, didn't want to finish it, and threw the rest in the bowl for a dog.  Heck, maybe I had even done that.\r\n\r\nBut then I heard Mrs. theskinnyonbenny ask what the dogs had eaten for dinner.  The answer was, \"Biscuits, goldfish, and bananas.\"\r\n\r\nI had wanted another biscuit that day too but I guess those stupid mutts enjoyed that meal.\r\n<!--more-->\r\nThis weekend, we took the dogs up to the in-law's farm, and on Friday night, they chose to run wild critters through the wild rather than come up to the house and eat.  They still weren't home when I went to bed that night.  Saturday morning, I went out to check on them.  They weren't home again.  I'm not  sure if they were still out or if they were out again.  I would have been worried, but I could hear Lily's barks echoing through the hills, as some poor rabbit, possum, or raccoon cowered in a makeshift shelter.\r\n\r\nVanya wanted nothing more than to drive the Gator around the farm, and for a six year old, he's not a bad driver.  I think it's highly likely that on Sunday, he was the only six year old in the world to both sing a selection from an opera (Figaro-Figaro, imitated from a Looney Tune) and to drive a piece of John Deere equipment.\r\n\r\nI've got to get that kid out hiking and camping this spring.

It made him think to ask, \"Well, can I have a cocktail now?\"\r\n\r\nHe's been somewhat intrigued by the fact that grown-ups get together, have a cocktail, and talk.  After his birthday party, I heard him ask his Granny, \"Are you going to come over to our house for cocktails?\"\r\n\r\nAt any rate, today's loose teeth are timed so that they coincide with the first generation to have phone video recording cameras at the ready, complete with lighting.  Parents of time gone by are forced to remember loose teeth, while we can have reminders like this.\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"http:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/36880838?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;color=66698\" width=\"400\" height=\"225\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen><\/iframe>\r\n\r\nSee, yesteryear's parents would probably forget the chapped lips and yellow molars.  I'm also surprised that the loose tooth is blue.  It's obviously already dead.\r\n\r\nHopefully, there won't be a lot of blood.\r\n\r\n<b>Update:<\/b>  I posted this Thursday evening, before heading out to the New Orleans streets for our normal lineup of parades.  After two rather boring ones, Muses starts.  It's late, but the crowd is more enthusiastic.  The bands are better; the floats are better; Vanya is really starting to have fun for the first time all night.\r\n\r\nThe scene is early in the parade.  Float 5 has just passed, and a high school band is approaching.  We can see Mrs. theskinnyonbenny's float right behind them.  We've been waiting for her float for three or four hours, and we're really keyed up.\r\n\r\nVanya taps me on the arm and points to a bit of empty street, just in front of us.  I bend down, but can't really hear what he's saying.  There are bits and pieces of trash where he's pointing.  I bend further.  I see a little white speck, and it dawns on me that maybe it's his tooth.\r\n\r\nI stab it with an index finger, and it sticks to the skin.  It feels like a tooth.  I confirm, \"You lost your tooth?\"\r\n\r\nHe nods as I lift him up on my shoulders to try to see his mother.  Strangers on each side hear that he lost his first tooth and high-five with congratulations.\r\n\r\nI worry about where to put it.  Mrs. theskinnyonbenny would be pissed if I lost it, but we're covered in beads and toys.  The tooth is really small, and I don't really trust my pockets.  Sarah suggests my wallet, and that seems to have worked.\r\n\r\nBy the way, did you know that the tooth fairy won't come find you?  You have to do the pillow-tooth bit at home for it to work.  She's no Santa Claus, that's for sure."

But I haven't even been watching 24-7 ESPN like I do during football season, and I'm tired of hearing about the guy.\r\n\r\nComparisons to Tim Tebow are nuts, and I think coming from the overzealous Christians looking for a hero.  Tebow was a Heisman trophy winner from a major college who was drafted in the first round.  He's actually <i>supposed<\/i> to be good.  Lin was undrafted and from Harvard.  No one but basketball die-hards had even heard of him 12 days ago.\r\n<!--more-->\r\nComparisons like that are what will make me hate the kid.  There are two people on earth who I would really like to see pushing daisies.  In one case, it's a personal dislike.  The other case is Tim Tebow.\r\n\r\nA better comparison for Lin is Kurt Warner.  He went from bagging groceries to leading one of the most prolific offenses in the history of the NFL in the course of a year.\r\n\r\nBut that isn't a good comparison either.  Warner went on to put together what is probably a hall of fame career.  Lin has had six amazing games in a major media market, but that's the equivalent of about 5 minutes of a football game.\r\n\r\nFloyd Mayweather was criticized for saying that the hype is just because Lin is ethnically Chinese.  He is definitely wrong about this -- the hype is because he outscored every other started in his first six games in the history of the NBA.  But, I have to think that his ethnicity has a lot to do with why he wasn't drafted.  I'm not going to bother looking up his stats from Harvard, but I bet they would show that this kid can play.  I know there were at least a few scouts around the league who rated him highly, only to get laughed out of the draft room.\r\n\r\nI haven't watched the guy play.  And if all we see is highlight after highlight, I'll be rooting for the other team when I finally do catch a game.\r\n\r\n<b>Update:<\/b>  Kind of cool that <a href=\"http:\/\/feinsteinonthebrink.com\/index.php?id=2843356311304035537\" target=\"_blank\">the best sportswriter in the country came up with the same argument<\/a>, albeit written much better.\r\n\r\nFeinstein really is the best.

The photo captures here perfectly.\r\n\r\nI can look at this and smell the clouds of cigarette smoke that billowed forth when she opened the door to her room, which attest -- along with the yellow streak through the front center of her white hair -- to a long running love affair with Phillip Morris.  <!--more-->The plastic cup undoubtedly is full of K&B brand gin.  And the story coming from her mouth is either unintentionally hilarious, or a description of a recent Murder She Wrote rerun.\r\n\r\nI did a lot of mean things to this old lady.  From banging on the door in the middle of the night, to prank phone calls from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=1NBmET5uvfI\" target=\"_blank\">Floyd Cramer<\/a>, to much worse.  I might even remember building a brick wall over her bedroom door one night while she slept inside.  (No one was around to stop us.  It was Thanksgiving weekend.)\r\n\r\nI like to think that she enjoyed the attention (if not the late-night wake-ups, which she assuredly did not).  Somehow, she actually liked her charges.  I remember that she offered us her television when the house TV was broken during the NCAA tournament, although she did insist on switching to the Murder She Wrote reruns when they were on.  And night after night, she would wander out and laugh at us during dinner, joining us in the foulest language a table has seen, and absorbing our insults on how bad the food was.\r\n\r\nIt's still hard to believe that prior to ending up in a shitty apartment in a fraternity house, Miss Mary appears to have led a fulfilling life.  A black-and-white picture of her in her youth showed a legitimately attractive young woman.  She was wife to long time Mayor Jesse Webb, for whom Webb park is named, and after he passed, she succeeded him in office.  To this day, she is still the only female mayor to have served Baton Rouge.\r\n\r\nI posted a couple of stories that include Miss Mary back in the day when this was actually a funny blog.  There's the  <a href=\"\/blog2\/archives\/205\">corn dog story at the bottom of this post,<\/a> and <a href=\"\/blog2\/archives\/115\">then there's an old favorite, where she thought cattle had been walking on her car<\/a>.\r\n\r\nRest in peace, Miss Mary.\r\n"

First, it's spot-on.  Second, it relates to the story that unfolds herein.  Although, come to think of it, if you've read the title of this post, and the tweet, you can pretty much fill in the rest of it all by yourself.\r\n<!--more-->\r\nSome time this winter, I noticed that a good number of our cable channels weren't coming in on the upstairs TV.  I didn't know this at the time, but Mrs. theskinnyonbenny had called Cox about two channels not coming in on the other TVs downstairs.  For that, it turned out that they sent a technician out to troubleshoot, just to come back and tell us that for boxes with <a href=\"http:\/\/theskinnyonbenny.com\/blog2\/archives\/987\">tuning adapters<\/a>, those channels weren't online yet.\r\n\r\nBut while he was in the house, I had him come up and look at the upstairs TV.  He called the mother ship, tried pairing an re-pairing the cable cards, claimed that those were defective, and that he had no spares, and that he would have to schedule another trip.  I had mentioned that the missing channels seemed to be the ones that we didn't get when we didn't have a connected tuning adapter, but he made no note of my comment.\r\n\r\nCox time spent at our house:  1 hour.\r\n\r\nThe next business day, another technician came out.  I kid you not, the man replaced cable cards 3 different times.  He spent hours on end talking to the people at the mother ship.  And eventually, he told me, \"None of us can figure out what's wrong.  Someone else will have to come out, but I think Bill Gates himself might have to come troubleshoot this one.\"\r\n\r\nBill Gates, cable television master technician.\r\n\r\nI didn't spend all of that time with him, so I'm guessing he did some troubleshooting on the tuning adapter, since I mentioned it to him twice.  In fact, now I recall that he distinctly told me that it wasn't the problem.\r\n\r\nHe was at our house for five hours, so,\r\n\r\nTotal Cox time at our house:  6 hours.\r\n\r\nThat night, two other donkeys came by.  They spent most of their time tracing wiring through the house and out to the pole (which doesn't make sense, since the other TVs were getting the channels).  They did take away the old tuning adapter and left a new one in its place, but after two hours, they threw in the towel as well.  \r\n\r\nWe'll call this one two people, at two and a half hours, so,\r\n\r\nTotal Cox time at our house:  11 hours.\r\n\r\nThese last two had told me to call TIVO and make sure that it had the most up to date software.  I went to an information screen, noted the version, and checked tivo.com to confirm in one minute that my software was current.  Then, I called Cox to set up the next batch of people to come out.\r\n\r\nThe woman who answered at least believed me about the tuning adapter.  She had me go to the TIVO setup screen for the tuning adapter.  I was surprised to see the screen say, in big, bold words across the top, \"Tuning Adapter is Not Connected.\"\r\n\r\nI was thinking hardware problem at that point.  But as the Cox woman held on the phone, I slid the cabinet out, looked in the back, and saw the end of the tuning adapter that plugs into the box dangling loose.

A little rain, but nothing like usual in the winter, and the usual post-rain cold weather has so far failed to materialize.  We've had some cool mornings, but in truth, it's been warm enough for shorts every day.\r\n\r\nIt was a great win for the inaugural <a href=\"http:\/\/www.thelouisianamarathon.com\" target=\"_blank\">Louisiana Marathon<\/a>, which managed to parlay the weather with a long holiday weekend in January to come up with a destination event for runners.  On Saturday, there was a 10K, followed by a 1.2-mile kids run.  I had taken Vanya for a couple of practice runs, and he was set to have a good go of it.  On our last practice, he ran a mile in 13 minutes, despite skipping for the first quarter mile and tripping, skidding along the road, and stopping to cry for a few minutes.  I really expected to run it in 10 or 11 minutes, which would be about as fast as I'm capable of pacing him.\r\n<!--more-->\r\n<table cellpadding=\"2\" align=\"right\"><tr><td width=\"5\" rowspan=\"2\"><spacer type=\"block\" width=\"5\" height=\"1\"><\/td><td width=\"250\" ><img src=\"http:\/\/theskinnyonbenny.com\/dailyphoto\/2012\/20120123.jpg\" width=\"250px\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td class=\"caption\" width=\"250\">Getting excited for the race.<\/td><\/tr><\/table>\r\n\r\nThe morning of the race, he was excited, and we ended up lining up right at the front of the pack (mistake #1).  He sometimes gets a little overwhelmed with sudden loud noises, so I warned him about the starting gun (mistake #2).  He got nervous about the boom to the point where when it did go off, he bolted upright in terror and started to cry.  To make it worse, the hundred other kids zoomed past us, adding a million chaotic sounds and images to his already overloaded senses.  I couldn't get him back to his normal self, but he braved through the race at the back of the pack, in a hurried walk.  We finished nearly last, in 17 minutes.\r\n\r\nAfter that, we had a talk about how it was brave for him to keep going, even though he was really scared, and by the time we got home, he had something to be proud of.\r\n\r\nThe next day, we got a beautiful morning, so I brought the kids out into the driveway, turned up the music from the Jeep stereo, and we sat there watching the honest-to-goodness marathoners pass.  They passed our house both coming and going, at about 14.5 and 22.5 miles.  I kept telling them that from here, it's downhill, both ways.\r\n\r\nThe marathon started at 7:00, and when I went out at 9:00, there was already a guy passing on his way <i>back toward the finish<\/i>.  This pretty much blows my mind.  For the past couple of years, I've been running pretty regularly, so now I have some context for this.  I just can't see how a body can go that far, that fast.  I could certainly stand to drop 25 pounds, and I'm sure that would improve my stamina and speed both, but when Halloween is followed by \"the Holidays\" which is followed by king cake season, which is followed by Easter, which leads to St. Patrick's Day....  Well, let's just say there ends up being two weeks in August where I can dial back the junk food and booze.\r\n\r\nI had a lot of fun interacting with the athletes.  I think a lot of them appreciated someone clapping or saying a word or two for them.  Some of the ladies liked seeing little kids on the route.  One person thanked me for having music blaring.  I always liked blaring music when I would do long bike tours too.\r\n\r\nIf you're interested in keeping virtual tabs on each other, <a href=\"http:\/\/runkeeper.com\/user\/bens4lsu\/activity\/67703280\" target=\"_blank\">hit me up on RunKeeper<\/a>.  I'm pretty proud of what I've done in January.  For some reason, I came back from Russia with the stamina to go forever, although at only a glacially slow pace.  All that walking with a backpack of tourist gear on my back and a 400-pound baby anchored to my chest did me some good, I guess."

The topic that came right to mind was the outrageously good football season that we were having, but when it comes to football fandom, I hold superstitions, and that ridiculous part of my brain doesn't allow me to deviate from whatever routine I was able to establish when the wins were coming.\r\n\r\nSo I watched every game without a stitch of underwear on.  I went all season without washing my hat. (Note to self:  don't buy any more white hats.)  And I didn't praise our team in writing.\r\n\r\nOf course, what was to be the best season in my lifetime, possibly the best season in school history disappeared.  \r\n<!--more-->\r\n<table cellpadding=\"2\" align=\"right\"><tr><td width=\"5\" rowspan=\"2\"><spacer type=\"block\" width=\"5\" height=\"1\"><\/td><td width=\"250\" ><img src=\"\/img\/hat2011.jpg\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td class=\"caption\" width=\"250\">This season's lucky hat, as it looks today.  I bought this late this summer.<\/td><\/tr><\/table>\r\n\r\nMy thought the next day was that every fan would have to identify what was different in his or her life on the day of the championship game as compared to the rest of the season.  One of the first things that occurred to me was that my friend Jeremy would have to have his new marriage annulled.  Wow, I'm sure that will be very disappointing to them both.\r\n\r\nThen, I realized that in order to get back to how we were all season, I would have to send <a href=\"http:\/\/theskinnyonbenny.com\/adop\/page.php?fn=ad_home_k.content#20111206\"\">Kolya<\/a> back to an orphanage in Russia.  I don't think we can take our superstitions quite that far.  Besides, I've always observed that these sorts of things reset themselves between seasons.  That said, you can blame Jeremy and me for the pitiful play, which I will never mention again after this paragraph.\r\n\r\n(But I am going to have one really bad in the context of a story from here down, so bail now if you don't like the foulest of foul language.)\r\n\r\nOne odd thing about this season is that due to the game schedule and a mid-season Russia trip, we only had a single tailgate party.  It was a good one, for the Auburn game, with the normal pre-dawn setup, breakfast, and then drinks all the way through game time.  It was an afternoon game, so it was a little easier than the 15-hour marathon that happens for ESPN night games.\r\n\r\nThe most story-worthy part of the game was a young and very drunk fan who walked into our tailgate some time late in the first half.  She walked right to the food table and without looking at or speaking to anyone, she started fixing herself a plate.\r\n\r\nCraig yelled over to her, \"While you're over there, can you fix me a plate?\"\r\n\r\nShe looked back and slurred, \"What does this look like?  1940s?\"\r\n\r\nShe sat down in the nearest chair -- one with a much better view of the game than most of the people who we know and like had.  She had fixed herself a lovely plate of pastalaya, except that she had put it on a bun.  The buns were really for the brisket, which she had passed over.\r\n\r\nWe started peppering her with questions.  \"So did you come from the game?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah, I was sitting next to some old cunt in an Auburn shirt.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well where are your friends?\"\r\n\r\n<!--<table cellpadding=\"2\" align=\"right\"><tr><td width=\"5\" rowspan=\"2\"><spacer type=\"block\" width=\"5\" height=\"1\"><\/td><td width=\"250\" ><img src=\"\/img\/passedout.jpg\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td class=\"caption\" width=\"250\">Does anyone recognize this girl?<\/td><\/tr><\/table>-->\r\n\r\n\"They're masturbating.  In the stadium.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wow.  I can see why you would want to leave.  How do you like the food?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's good, but it would be better if you didn't put it on bread.\"\r\n\r\nIt went on like this for some time.  Eventually, she helped herself to a beer from someone's ice chest.\r\n\r\nTo one side, a friend of ours played with his baby.  Three others told the girl that he was our nanny, and that we had each slept with the mother, and we were raising the baby jointly, not knowing who the real father was.  She picked one of us as the most likely father, and went along with our story.  Perhaps she believed it, perhaps not, but it's fun  to spew bullshit and have it accepted without question.\r\n\r\nEventually, she passed out in her chair, cradling her beer like a baby.\r\n\r\nAfter the game, we left her sleeping in the chair while we packed up chairs, tables, tents, cooking equipment, tv's and all of the other things that people pulled out there.  I looked back, and she was still asleep in the chair on the leaves and beneath the tree.  It looked so much more out of place than it did with a tailgate party set up around her.\r\n\r\nI was all for giving up the chair and leaving her like that.  How funny it would be for her to wake up there in the next pre-dawn morning without a clue of where she is or how she ended up there.  But as we debated what to do, she woke up, found that her phone was missing, lead a phone hunt, and then stumbled away without finding it.  "

Mrs. theskinnyonbenny played free safety, making sure to stay out in front with the players who were sprinting downfield.  I played middle linebacker, dropping back to cover the intermediate zone, and the other two parents covered the kids who hung back to catch the outlet pass.\r\n\r\nV had some funny moments.  As he turned to sprint away from one house, I heard him direct his friend, \"Say Thank You, Spiderman!\"  \r\n\r\nLater, I tousled his hair and he told me, \"Don't do that, Papa.  I have pretty hair.\"\r\n\r\nAt the end of the night, once the other kids had run out of gas, he ran up to a couple more tables of candy-givers.  A couple of times, I heard him ask, \"Can I get one more for my friend?\"  And he really did go offer the extra to Spiderman.  Spidey accepted one, but rejected the other.  V gave no thoughts to getting extras for the younger kids.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/img\/greenline.gif\" class=\"greenline\" alt=\"{{divider}}\" \/>\r\n\r\nLast night, fairly late, we got a knock on the door.  I answered it, and a uniformed cop asked to speak to me.  He looked about thirteen.\r\n\r\nHe told me that my car was parked illegally in the street around the corner.  I had parallel parked on the road when I driveway was full during the day.  I gave him a little guff about the legality of parallal parking on the side of a residential street, but I needed to move my car back home anyway, so I got my keys and drove it back.\r\n\r\nHe waited in my driveway, and when I got back, he tore up the ticket that he had put on my windshield before coming to my door.  So that was nice.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, I'm still waiting for the police to investigate the workers who robbed us two years ago.  The ones where we gave them the names, addresses, and phone numbers of the perpetrators, and where they couldn't be bothered to do more than write a police report."

My row-mates are Russian ladies, one old and fat enough to spill over into my seat, and one young and thin.\r\n\r\nThe old lady smiles and shifts herself over in a friendly attempt to give me as much room as possible.  The young one has a triangle-shaped Russian guitar.  We have one too, and I couldn't remember what they're called.  (I asked.  It's a balalaika.  I couldn't conjure the Russian to explain that there's also one on the shelf where we feed the cats, so I let it go at that.)\r\n\r\nMrs. theskinnyonbenny was in the seat in front of me, and when she leaned her chair back, her headrest was about five inches from my face.  I fell asleep, and at one point, with my eyes closed, I tried to shift my butt backwards in my seat.  The small bit of forward-leaning required for that maneuver cased me to bash my eyebrow line against her chair.\r\n\r\nWhen I woke up, the old babushka had gotten an extra snack from the stewardess pass, and she insisted that I eat.  I thanked her and declined; then, I went back to sleep.\r\n\r\nI woke up again later (couldn't believe that we were still over Greenland.  I felt like I had had an eight hours of sleep night), and she made the younger girl go into her bag and pull out Russian chocolates that they had brought aboard.  They insisted that I try a couple.  Those were very good.\r\n\r\nWe chatted in broken Russian and English for a little while, and when there was a pause, a yawn escaped me.

Every quarter mile or so, there are roads perpendicular to the coast that let you go between the two directional streets. \r\n\r\nBalls Alley looks like it's one of these pass through roads. But it isn't. Early in the week, Mrs. theskinnyonbenny, Brent, and I turned down Balls Alley to make the jump. but instead of going through, it got more and more narrow, and finally, it ended in a jumble of shacks and wrecked cars. \r\n<!--more-->\r\n<table cellpadding=\"2\" align=\"right\"><tr><td width=\"5\" rowspan=\"2\"><spacer type=\"block\" width=\"5\" height=\"1\"><\/td><td width=\"350\" ><img src=\"http:\/\/theskinnyonbenny.com\/img\/gal\/077%20-%20Bahamas%2040th%20Birthday\/resIMG_20110727_6808.JPG\" width=\"350px\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td class=\"caption\" width=\"250\">Looking down Balls Alley<\/td><\/tr><\/table>\r\n\r\nWe turned around and headed out.  Toward the start, the alley was lined with dudes, taking big fatties, trying to wave us over and take our orders. Or our lives. Could have gone either way, had we stopped. \r\n\r\nFrom then on, we got the same reaction from the native Bahamians when we would mention having visited Balls Alley.  Their eyes would get wide, and they would say incredulously, \"<em>Balls Alley<\/em>. I can't believe you went there!\"  that would be followed by a serious attempt to sober us up for a second so that we MIT heed the warning never to go there again. \r\n\r\nWe got that warning at the Greyclif, an expensive but good restaurant hosted by a pantywaist in a bow-tie who didn't want us drunks there at all.  That didn't stop his bar waitress from serving strait rum one on top of the other, getting me to the point where I loudly ate a ball of butter while waiting for the bread. \r\n\r\n<table cellpadding=\"2\" align=\"right\"><tr><td width=\"5\" rowspan=\"2\"><spacer type=\"block\" width=\"5\" height=\"1\"><\/td><td width=\"250\" ><img src=\"http:\/\/theskinnyonbenny.com\/img\/gal\/077%20-%20Bahamas%2040th%20Birthday\/resIMG_20110723_6648.JPG\" width=\"250px\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td class=\"caption\" width=\"250\">Too sexy to be 40.<\/td><\/tr><\/table>\r\n\r\nThe bar features an excellent piano player by name of Pam, who has the ability to play, sing, and participate in your conversations simultaneously. We made serious plans to have her back to our house on an upcoming night to perform privately.\r\n\r\nFortunately, we didn't follow through on the private Pam performance. I say that it's fortunate because many of us were passed out before dark on the night where we had it planned. We had spent most of the day on a boat charter, where we caught a bunch of fish and then swam off anchor from as pretty a beach as you can envision. We brought along enough beer to supply the Bahamian Navy on a four month cruise, but half of that was earmarked for Mark, who got seasick and didn't fulfill our expectations in amount consumed. \r\n\r\nWe followed the trip by adding to our tip with free drinks for captain and crew at the marina bar. The next thing I remember is getting out of bed, finding that the refrigerator had a lot of the fish grilled, with conch salad. I ate, the found Clay and Brent passed out in front of a soccer game, their bellies covered in cheesecake crumbs.\r\n\r\nFrom there, I went down to poolside, where the wife's were mixing it up at the bar by the pool with the guy who does some maintenance around the house.

We were flying from Moscow to Washington D.C. on Sunday.  The plane has two seats to each side, and then a middle aisle with three seats each.  We've drawn two middle seats between strangers.  My row-mates are Russian ladies, one old and fat enough to spill over into my seat, and one young and thin.\r\n\r\nThe old lady smiles and shifts herself over in a friendly attempt to give me as much room as possible.  The young one has a triangle-shaped Russian guitar.  We have one too, and I couldn't remember what they're called.  (I asked.  It's a balalaika.  I couldn't conjure the Russian to explain that there's also one on the shelf where we feed the cats, so I let it go at that.)\r\n\r\nMrs. theskinnyonbenny was in the seat in front of me, and when she leaned her chair back, her headrest was about five inches from my face.  I fell asleep, and at one point, with my eyes closed, I tried to shift my butt backwards in my seat.  The small bit of forward-leaning required for that maneuver cased me to bash my eyebrow line against her chair.\r\n\r\nWhen I woke up, the old babushka had gotten an extra snack from the stewardess pass, and she insisted that I eat.  I thanked her and declined; then, I went back to sleep.\r\n\r\nI woke up again later (couldn't believe that we were still over Greenland.  I felt like I had had an eight hours of sleep night), and she made the younger girl go into her bag and pull out Russian chocolates that they had brought aboard.  They insisted that I try a couple.  Those were very good.\r\n\r\nWe chatted in broken Russian and English for a little while, and when there was a pause, a yawn escaped me.  The old lady patted my shoulder.  \"You sleep, you sleep.\"\r\n\r\nNice people lately."

He was stir crazy, so we left early, taking his bike to the park to ride around for a bit before class.\r\n\r\nWe did our thing, loaded his bike back into the car, and started to pull out.  There were some other families coming from the sidewalk to the parking lot, and a couple of kids climbing into the mini van parked next to us, so I looked around very carefully, and started to back up very very slowly.  I'll note that my vision was especially good, as the top and windows were down on the Jeep.\r\n\r\nAs we started to back out, some loud mother came around behind me, give my Jeep the \"talk to the hand\" gesture, and started shouting.\r\n\r\n\"STOP, STOP, STOP.\"\r\n\r\n\"EVERYBODY GET HOLD OF YOUR CHILDREN.  WHERE ARE THE CHILDREN.\"\r\n\r\nShe then stopped another car trying to leave the lot, and directed me to back out in front of that car, screaming instructions all the while.\r\n\r\nVanya was concerned by the shouting.  \"What's the matter, Papa.\"\r\n<!--more-->\r\nThe only answer I could think of was one that wasn't appropriately repeated to a five-year-old, so I just muttered under my breath, \"That lady is a loudmouth cunt.\"\r\n\r\n\"WHAT?  What did you say Papa?\"\r\n\r\n\"I didn't say anything.  I just called that lady a really bad word.\"\r\n\r\nBy then, our slow reverse had brought the topless, windowless Jeep so that she was right next to us, just one or two feet away.  Vanya sounded louder.\r\n\r\n\"WHY PAPA?  WHY DID YOU CALL THAT LADY A REALLY BAD WORD?\"\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/img\/greenline.gif\" class=\"greenline\" alt=\"{{divider}}\" \/>\r\n\r\nGymnastics was at 6:00 on Thursday, and that coincided with the time of the unveiling of the Shaqstue, which was happening in the parking lot shared by the Field House (location of gymnastics) and the basketball practice building.  I went outside to watch the unveiling.\r\n\r\nLSU has some official photos and video of the event that are better than mine, but I had a pretty good spot.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/img\/shaqstue1.jpg\" alt=\"shaqstue1\" \/>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/img\/shaqstue2.jpg\" alt=\"shaqstue1\" \/>\r\n\r\nShaq, with his mother and Dale Brown.\r\n<img src=\"\/img\/shaqstue3.jpg\" alt=\"shaqstue1\" \/>\r\n\r\nThere were all kinds of former players at the event, especially Shaq's teammates, who are my favorites, being the team that played when I was a student.  (I don't think Chris Jackson made it, though.)\r\n\r\nI had a hard time recognizing them, mostly because my vantage point was primarily backs of heads.  But I did have a pretty easy time identifying Stanly Roberts, even from far away.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/img\/shaqstue4.jpg\" alt=\"shaqstue1\" \/>\r\n"

Unsaid, but equally well understood is the fact that there are some places where it's just fine not to wash your hands after you use the toilet.  Let this serve as my attempt to quantify when and when it is not okay.\r\n\r\nNot surprisingly, the specific rules differ depending on whether you've gone #1 or #2.  (Let's face it, when you go #2, there's just the thinnest, flimsiest piece of material in the world between your hand and poop.)\r\n\r\nIt's okay to NOT wash your hands, no matter which number you've gone when...\r\n<!--more-->\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>You're in a port-a-john.  Obviously, there's not much choice in the matter here.  I'm reminded of one particularly crowded football tailgate.  By game time, one of the port-a-john's was so full, that the fluid was right up to the very top of the seat.  There was even that millimeter of fluid that sticks up even higher than the containing vessel, whatever that's called.  Atop it all floated a giant turd, left by God-knows-who.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Right before a shower.  If you're just hopping in the shower anyway, we presume your hands will get clean in there.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\nThat's all I can really come up with.  The rules are a little more lax when you go #1.  In all cases, I assume that you're dexterous enough not to pee on your hands.\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Outside.  If you're out on the back deck, having a cocktail at night, and if you want to walk over and pee in the bushes, then be my guest.  Call me a redneck if you must, but that's okay by me.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Football game, gas station, or similarly filthy public restroom.  I often make the following judgement:  \"Which is dirtier?  My bare penis, or this sink?\"  Oftentimes, the penis wins.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>In the shower.  Yes, it's usually pretty trashy to pee in the shower.  But check out how cool my bathroom is:  The shower head just comes out of the wall of a big wet area.  Fancy-minded readers will picture a spa.  Non-fancy-minded readers will picture a high school locker room shower.  It's something between those, but the point is, that I need only make a quarter turn to the right, and I'm standing at the toilet.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>In the swimming pool.  Don't cringe.  I saw you there, all summer, drinking beer after beer in the shallow end and never taking a pee break.  It's tough to teach that to a small kid.  This year I didn't even try.  I let him bolt to the restroom every hour or more.  \r\n\r\nPart of my worry was based on an incident early in the summer.  Mrs. theskinnyonbenny was chatting with other moms, when one pointed and shouted, \"Oh my God, He's peeing in the pool!\"  How would she know?  Because V was up on the concrete, with swimsuit around his knees, peeing down into the pool water.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n"

That just leaves us with stories to tell.\r\n\r\nThat just leaves us with stories, and one story is important for context before we get to the video.\r\n<!--more-->\r\nOur rent house came along with two canoes.  It became my routine to go out for a short paddle with one or two of the kids around sunset every evening.  The first of the nights where I started my sunset cruises, Brent decided to come out in the other canoe with whichever kid was feeling left behind.  Somehow or other (I was out in the lake), he tumped the canoe over and fell into the ankle-deep water right by the shore.\r\n\r\nWhen I returned, the wives were several drinks in, sitting down on the gravel beach by the canoes.  They asked me to see if the other canoe had a hole in it, as Brent had made up that particular piece of bullshit to explain his little swim.  I don't remember why, but I noted that there was a sticker in the canoe listing its weight limit as 700 pounds.  Mrs. theskinnyonbenny chimed in, \"That's just you plus a sack of dog food!\"\r\n\r\nI could have let it go, and I don't think it would have come up again, but instead, I took every opportunity to refer to my weight, which I proudly stated as 660 pounds.  I'd even like to get an LSU jersey with \"660\" in the spot where the last name should go.\r\n\r\nOne of the most memorable things we did is to go to these particular cliffs, and jump into the water from them.  They were 25-30 feet high, and from the top, you could see the bottom, even though it was pretty deep.  I never did hit the bottom, and the kids at the marina only ever heard of one person to touch bottom there at all.\r\n\r\nWe went two different days.  Here's my jump the second time that we went.\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"http:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/26141649?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0\" width=\"651\" height=\"488\" frameborder=\"0\"><\/iframe>\r\n\r\nCrystal's jump was the funniest.  I think she was scared about drifting back into the face of the cliff, so she prevented that by just running down.  I don't know how to describe it, except to say that it's something you might see the Coyote in Looney Tunes do.  Watch for yourself.\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"http:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/26165295?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0\" width=\"651\" height=\"366\" frameborder=\"0\"><\/iframe>\r\n\r\nOne day, we were all the way down at the far end of the lake -- probably 20-30 miles from home, and the boat wouldn't start.  Brent took the kids up into the town of Lake George to find a restroom.  They found a spot at an Italian restaurant, and he was nervous that they guy wouldn't let the kids go, because we weren't customers.\r\n\r\nInstead, he couldn't have been nicer.  \"Come on in, my friend.  No worries.  I have kids too; I know how it is.\"  His kindness made a great impression, and one day, we tried to go back to his restaurant for lunch, but unfortunately, or day back was a day that they are closed for lunch.  \r\n\r\nAnd what happens to nice guys?  <a href=\"http:\/\/www.fox23news.com\/mostpopular\/story\/Pizza-shop-owner-former-Siena-soccer-coach-arrest\/M6gzgz8j2Um8WENC6guG7Q.cspx\" target=\"_blank\">This<\/a>.  No shit.  \r\n\r\nI guess it's not entirely surprising to find drug dealers in upstate New York, but it did surprise me to find a healthy number of rednecks.  The most Louisiana-worthy was a guy who at 10:00 at night stumbled drunk out of a convenience store.  He saw that we saw him miss the step on the way out, so he came over to the car to chat.  The slurred coversation about what fish are biting would have been right out of North Louisiana Stereotype Casting.\r\n\r\nI don't have much to say about Lake Placid, which we drove up to see, but I do have to ask, how did this town host an Olympics?  The tiny main throughfare through the town must have been packed shoulder to shoulder, like Bourbon Street during Mardi Gras.  The question that really gets me is \"Where did the people stay?\"  There couldn't be more than 1000 hotel rooms in the whole county.\r\n\r\nLast story:  one morning we went out to catch a river rafting trip.  On the bus ride to the put-in, we got the standard rafting trip lecture on safety and procedures.  The guide giving the instructions was kind of a clown, peppering his speech with one-liners, and trying to make the families on the bus comfortable that the dire situations he described wouldn't actually be a problem.  At the end, the guide asked, \"Does anyone have a medical condition or is on any medication that we should know about?\"\r\n\r\nNow that I've been on the trip, this is certainly an insurance company requirement.  There's no reason that this little river would tax any medical condition that I can imagine.\r\n\r\nBefore I could stop myself, my hand shot up.  When they guy made eye contact, I said, \"I have erectile dysfunction!\"\r\n\r\nHe stood there, not knowing what to say for a couple of seconds.  So I added, \"If that matters to our rafting trip...\"\r\n\r\nIt would have remained awkward, but there was too much laughing.  And it turned out that the state of my penis did, in fact, not matter to the rafting trip.\r\n\r\nI'll close with this last video of us trying to make our way up the lake to get home before darkness set in.\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"http:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/26167717?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0\" width=\"651\" height=\"366\" frameborder=\"0\"><\/iframe>"

We did the normal wandering around of governmental buildings and monuments.  \r\n\r\nVanya started the day tired and whiny.  I would complain that it was hotter than hell, except that I'm posting this from Louisiana in August, where the devil himself won't visit a house that has the air conditioning turned off.\r\n\r\nAfter we walked around for a while, we stopped at this little store to load up with cold drinks.  Vanya did some little favor for the cashier, and the man gave him a big, fake hundred dollar bill.  While we were sitting outside and drinking from our plastic bottles, Vanya went back in and did him some other nicety, and he came back with two more over-sized fake bills.\r\n<!--more-->\r\n<table cellpadding=\"2\" align=\"left\"><tr><td width=\"250\" ><img src=\"http:\/\/theskinnyonbenny.com\/img\/gal\/074%20-%20Washington%20DC%202011\/data\/normal.jpg\"><\/td><td width=\"5\" rowspan=\"2\"><spacer type=\"block\" width=\"5\" height=\"1\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td class=\"caption\" width=\"250\">Ice cream sandwich in front of the Washington Monument.<\/td><\/tr><\/table>\r\n\r\nFrom there, we started walking toward the White House, and as we got close, he started chirping, \"I have some dollars for Washington!\"\r\n\r\nBeing in the middle of a budget battle, I thought about how they would probably take play money from a five-year-old, but I didn't share.  Five-year-olds aren't all that good an audience for political humor.\r\n\r\nIt turned out that he thought that George Washington was the first, and still the current President.  I tried to explain about how he was around hundreds of years ago, and he's long since dead.  Vanya was more interested in asking about death than he was about finding out about presidents, so we didn't get much further than that.\r\n\r\nLater, we were passing near the Washington Monument, and V needed a restroom stop.  I walked with him into a men's room full of people shuffling in and out to the urinals and stalls.  When he was up, he walked to the short urinal and dropped his pants.  Then, he pulled down his underwear.  (It's so funny how little kids pee with their pants and drawers down around their knees.)\r\n\r\n<table cellpadding=\"2\" align=\"left\"><tr><td width=\"250\" ><img src=\"http:\/\/theskinnyonbenny.com\/img\/gal\/074%20-%20Washington%20DC%202011\/resIMG_20110624_5768.JPG\" width=\"250\"><\/td><td width=\"5\" rowspan=\"2\"><spacer type=\"block\" width=\"5\" height=\"1\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td class=\"caption\" width=\"250\">Ice cream sandwich in front of the Washington Monument.<\/td><\/tr><\/table>\r\n\r\nBut Vanya had a pair of pajama pants under his underwear.  They surprised him as much as they did me, and he laughed and talked loudly about the pants he had on under his underwear.\r\n\r\nThen, he pulled them down, and there was yet another pair of drawers.  He laughed even louder and pointed it out to me, and in effect to all of the people trying to come and go through the bathroom.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure how hot it must have been in D.C. in June, through the middle of the day, with one's shorts area covered by four layers of cotton.

		"post_content" : "The theskinnyonbenny family spent last week on Lake George, in upstate New York. Or I guess more accurately, we were on a little spit of the lake that dumps into a river. We could boat or drive to the lake, but poor landscaping prevented the picturesque view that we deserved as tourists from far away. \r\n\r\nWe got to try many of their local restaurants, and one experience motivated me to post a review on Yelp or some similar site. Unfortunately, I don't remember the name of the place,and Mrs. theskinnyonbenny wasn't able to find it for me, so I post most of my review here. \r\n<!--more-->\r\n<blockquote>The best thing I can say about this restaurant is that I did not catch hepatitis-B from their filthy silverware. You see, they would have actually had to have brought me silverware in order for that to happen. What I got instead were excuses. Excuses why a small dog couldn't sit quietly next to the table on the patio, excuses why a 40-year-old couldn't be served a White Russian (\"My job is on the line!\"), excuses why there were no appetizer plates (on 2nd thought, there was no explanation on that one), excuses why silverware was missing, why there were no condiments, why they couldn't accept American Express. \r\n\r\nYes, the view is nice, bit there must be other places in town where the niceties don't stop with the view. <\/blockquote>\r\n\r\nI shouldn't start with a complaint.  I hate complainers, but I was so happy with my hepatitis-B line, I wanted to get it written before it eeked out of my brain. \r\n\r\nWe had a great trip. The water was cold and clear, the weather pleasant, and the liquor store was well stocked. We boated, hiked, rafted, ate, and drank until all hours of the night. Crystal and Mrs. theskinnyonbenny were up late enough to see the sun rise.  Twice. \r\n\r\nThere may be nothing better than sitting outside in cool night air, bullshitting with people you like.  It happens all the time that I sit and listen to stories and quotes, and I think, \"I need to write that down or record it, or I won't remember to post anything about it on theskinny.\"  And I never write it down; I never record it; and the hilarious story is lost forever.  (Unless it's a story from Lisa Yarid Ferry, in which case the story is lost until she tells it again the next night.)\r\n\r\nOne of these nights, Brent was laying out the facts of something or other.  Corporate America, I think.  One of the things he said was, \"Everything what you think you think, is not the way you think.\"\r\n\r\nThat, of course, is hilarious on its own.  But in order for me to remember and get the quote right, I knew I would have to save it.  Recording myself seemed easier than finding somewhere to write it, so I went to my phone, and spoke the quote back into it.  Then, my own slurred nonsense reminded me the next day.  See for yourself:\r\n\r\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"http:\/\/mediaplayer.yahoo.com\/js\"><\/script><a href=\"\/sound\/EverythingYouThink.wav\">Benny's voice:  \"Everything you think you think is not what you think<\/a>\r\n\r\nThe time we spent sitting outside was considerably more pleasurable later in the week.  When we got there, you couldn't really see the waterline at all for all the overgrown brush between the house and the lake.  But somehow, Brent came across a pair of loppers.  I looked out the bedroom window to see brush going down, and as quickly as I could, I grabbed my phone and went out on the deck to document the carnage.\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"http:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/26141630?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0\" width=\"651\" height=\"366\" frameborder=\"0\"><\/iframe>\r\n\r\nWho does this sort of thing to rental property?\r\n\r\nMore words, pics, and vids will trickle out over time."

Even the drinks in the fridge are lukewarm.  You're also bored out of your mind.  The only form of entertainment is a tinny boom box with fading batteries.  \r\n\r\nYou and your significant other have sex on the floor.  Not because of your passion (in truth, you're on each others' nerves), but because the floor is a little cooler than the furniture.  Slippery bodies, covered in sweat, uncomfortable the whole while, but a little bit fun too.\r\n\r\nWhile all of this is going on, Black Joe Lewis and the Honeybears should be playing on that boom box."

My eyes went back to the counter, and I noticed that there were two cups.  The one labeled \"Trash\" was full of meat spears.  The other one was empty.\r\n\r\nAs I stood there, stomach tuning, hoping that whoever had used this spear before me hadn't sucked the grease off the stick like I did, another man came up, picked a used spear out of the cup, and took a sausage.  I opened my mouth to warn him, but then I thought it would make my day better to see him suffer the same realization that I did.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, he walked off, spear in hand as he finished his bite, denying me the satisfaction of a brother in nausea."

The premise of the dream was that somehow over the years, the traditions associated with Easter and the ones associated with Thanksgiving had become confused.

Actually, Jesus's dead body was laid on a table, and it began changing into a Thanksgiving feast.  Some attendees started praying, while I and others of my ilk (not sure what my role was, exactly) started to eat.

This had something to do with the awake side of my head, because I was definitely thinking of theskinnyonbenny.com as a logical place to publish a lengthy poem about dead Jesus turning into Thanksgiving food.\r\n\r\nWhen I did wake up, all of that creative energy got sucked into the ether.  I remember just one couplet:\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Some had fallen to their knees, confessing\r\nWhile his intestines turned into a savory dressing.<\/blockquote>\r\n\r\nI'm certain that you share my disappointment the fact that some sacrilege and humor is lost to the world forever."

We were around the back side, where staff walked to get back to the kitchen.  One of the waiters passed behind us, singing along with the speakers.

Consider it a blog version of a movie trailer.\r\n\r\nWhile we ate, our regular bartender had disappeared for a moment (his frequent bathroom visits suggest either diarrhea or a fairly severe drug addiction), and the manager was working the bar.  Mrs. theskinnyonbenny noticed the biggest whisk on the face of the Earth sitting back there, and she asked the manager what they did with it.  I'm sure it fueled fantasies of giant exotic concoctions, where coconut oil had to be interspersed with droplets of nectar from a special strain of hibiscus, or something like that.\r\n\r\nThe manager said that even though they put fresh ingredients into the frozen margarita machines every day, they sometimes would clump or separate, so they used the whisk to make it right.\r\n\r\nFast forward to 9:00 PM.  As we were waiting for the check, the normal bartender went and got a giant bucket.  He placed it under one of the frozen margarita nozzles, and emptied the machine into the bucket.  There were probably between 5 and 10 gallons of drink in there.  I gave it a shrug, and mentioned that it was an awful lot of margarita to throw out.\r\n\r\nBut then, the bartender carefully sealed the bucket with a plastic lid, double checking that it was on nice and tight.   Ahhh, it's clear now.  Mrs. theskinnyonbenny said it out loud as the thought formed in my head.  \"Fresh everyday my ass.\"\r\n\r\nGood to know."

When not pouring drinks for tourists who are usually oblivious to the fact that they're ordering from one of the best bartenders in the world, he travels to speaking engagements and cocktail events around the world.\r\n\r\nThe party had several tables set up throughout the museum, and each one had selected featured bartenders from around the city.  I chatted with a couple of my favorites and started to look around the room for more.\r\n\r\nSoon, Chris noticed us, made a beeline across the room to welcome us and to thank us for coming.  He started talking about how it was World Cocktail Day and why it was World Cocktail Day (1st definition of the word appears in print).  That led him to walk us to the exhibit with the letter where cocktail was defined in a New York newspaper so long ago, which led to a quick private tour of his favorite exhibit pieces in the gallery.\r\n\r\nIt was very cool."

		"post_content" : "This weekend, we set sail for what is an annual tradition.  We get on Velvet Elvis, and cruise for Easter.  Where we go is a function of wind and weather.  We sometimes anchor and enjoy the solitude of a quiet private marsh; we sometimes tie up in another town and enjoy their hospitality.\r\n\r\nOn Saturday, we scrubbed the trip just an hour or so into it.  The wind was fiercely strong, and the lake responded with huge angry waves.  The bow plowed into a couple of huge angry green waves when we first entered the lake, and there was enough wash to slosh into the open cabin through the boat's open pop-top on one.\r\n\r\nWhen we were far enough out into the lake to make a turn, pass under a bridge, and try to make toward a destination, the waves were huge and confused.  They rolled our little boat from side to side, and they pitched us back and forth.  I don't want our little one to think our Easter trip is a frightful experience to be dreaded like hellfire, so I brought us all back in.\r\n\r\nSo, we had to do a shore-bound Easter.  The Easter bunny didn't necessarilly know where to find Vanya, so he left the basket aboard, as usual.  He found it very quickly after getting out of bed.  (Stick with this video for a little bit.  It gets better.)\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"http:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/22924722?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;color=666698\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\"><\/iframe>\r\n\r\nSunday was calmer, and I sailed hard and long that day.  But we didn't leave overnight, because the Monday forecast was even worse that Saturday's.  If we had gone somewhere, we would have had no choice but to wait extra days, or go back through the bad stuff.\r\n\r\nSomething strange happened either before or during my sail on Sunday.  I'm not sure when or how, but when I returned, the marine radio installed on the boat and my ipod sitting right next to it were hosed.  I could get both of them to light up the screen, but neither would actually come all the way on and work.  In addition to that, my phone took one rogue splash when I had it in the cockpit with me on Saturday.  It wasn't ruined, but it kept telling me that an unauthorized accessory was plugged in, and the speaker didn't work.  I had to use headphones to hear calls.\r\n\r\nMy week turned toward the better when the Apple store set me up with a replacement ipod and phone without charging me a cent, buying my loyalty for many years to come, no matter how much itunes tells me that I'm not authorized to play all of the music that I bought from the iStore.\r\n\r\nI also just took a call from my nephew to tell me that the radio on the boat fixed itself.  So this went from a week that had the potential to be cripplingly expensive, to one that is just moderately inconvenient.\r\n\r\nI decided that since I have to configure a new ipod and a new phone, I would come up with a new scheme for thier naming.  \"ben's iphone\" is such a boring name.\r\n\r\nI'm going with puns on names of Asian food.  \"pod stickers\" for the ipod.  I'm thinking of \"Dragon and phone-ix\" for the phone, but that's a little lengthy.  It would also give me the obvious \"pad Thai\" if I ever get an ipad.\r\n\r\nOf course, I'm the only one who would see the labels and get the joke.  It's not like I would walk around the house saying, \"Honey, did you see where I left Dragon and phone-ix?\"  I would still just say, \"Did you see where I left my phone?\""

Come show your support!\r\n\r\nVisit <a href=\"http:\/\/www.repealcreationism.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">www.repealcreationism.com<\/a> for more information about this effort. \r\nClick <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/event.php?eid=209023669116019&index=1\" target=\"_blank\">here<\/a> for more information about this event.<\/blockquote>\r\n<!--more-->\r\nIf you've read for long, you understand that I'm not particularly interested in politics.  And I'm especially uninterested in <i>your<\/i> politics.  But we should agree that it's shameful that a high school student feels the need to petition his state legislature so that his science class can be free to teach, uhm, actual science.\r\n\r\nFor those who have forgotten science, it's the process by which facts are revealed to humanity.  Someone has an idea, and then looks to verify that idea through observation, measurement, and study of the properties of things from sub-atomic particles to the movement of galaxies.  \r\n\r\nLittle by little, science finds that theories start to align, and different methods of research, computation, and study point to a particular solution.  Such solutions become accepted as fact.\r\n\r\nHere is an example of something that is not science:  a guy, thousands of years ago, has an idea about how something came about.  He wasn't a bad guy, and for his time, his ideas made a lot of sense.  He assumed it to be fact and wrote it in a book.\r\n\r\nFor thousands of years, humans assume that his book is correct, and as science starts to suggest that perhaps another answer is the correct one, the humans cling to the original book as if their lives depended on it.\r\n\r\nThat example is actually referred to as \"faith.\"\r\n\r\nI have no problem with those who blindly hold to their faith and deny facts as presented by science.  Those people are wrong, but we're all wrong in many ways, on many topics, large and small.  My problem is setting school curricula that force students to swallow matters of faith under the guise of Science class.  If you want your child to be taught religion at school, there is no shortage of private schools whose mission includes such instruction.\r\n\r\nBut think about this:  our creator -- whoever you believe that to be -- empowered us with minds like no other creatures.  Minds that can think and reason and learn from those who foraged through the forest of knowledge that came before us.  Did the creator give us those minds so that we could blindly hold on to a notion that was presented thousands of years ago?  Or was the intention that we grow our collective knowledge and become a better informed species?"

They've paddled alongside dolphins and watched the pelicans go after their fish.\r\n\r\nOthers know the coast less personally.  They know that this unique ecosystem provides America with most of its shrimp, crab, and oysters.  They know that most of the oil and natural gas come through our state.  And they have some idea that the state is washing away.\r\n<!--more-->\r\nWhat we might not realize is how much else comes through Louisiana ports.  Without them, almost everything we consume -- food, textiles, electronics, vehicles, toys, and pretty much anything else you think of (because really, do we make anything at all in this country any more?) come through these ports.\r\n\r\nThe speaker showed us some maps that amazed me.  These show the amount of goods trucked from major U.S. ports to other parts of the country.  The thickness of the red lines correspond to the amount of freight moved by truck.\r\n\r\nFirst, the port of New York.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/img\/maps\/trafficNY.jpg\" alt=\"NY Traffic\" \/>\r\n\r\nLos Angeles\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/img\/maps\/trafficLA.jpg\"  alt=\"LA Traffic\" \/>\r\n\r\nHouston\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/img\/maps\/trafficHou.jpg\"  alt=\"houston Traffic\"\/>\r\n\r\nNew Orleans\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/img\/maps\/TrafficNO.jpg\"  alt=\"NO Traffic\"\/>\r\n\r\nLouisiana Ports Combined\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/img\/maps\/trafficLouisiana.jpg\"  alt=\"Louisiana Traffic\"\/>\r\n\r\nHow about by sea?

I have my thoughts. (It was nice having you around Plaquemines Parish, but time to let you sink beneath the sea.)  Besides, having an intelligent opionion means providing intelligent reasoning.  I'm capabile of doing that, but it doesn't sound like a fun way of spending a Saturday morning.\r\n\r\nNote:  these maps were pulled from a presentation published on <a href=\"http:\/\/coastal.louisiana.gov\/index.cfm?md=pagebuilder&tmp=home&nid=76&pnid=0&pid=66&catid=0&elid=0\" target=\"_blank\">coastal.louisiana.gov<\/a>.

You covered that too, right.\r\n\r\nPolly:  Yeah boss, but shouldn't we explain?\r\n\r\nEE:  Explain Hell!  We're rolling around in cash!  This was our best year ever.  Just last week I had the boys fill my hot tub with champagne just so I could feel those bubble tickling my bung hole.\r\n\r\nPolly:  I don't guess I should mention that in the writeup.\r\n\r\nEE:  I'd like to, but maybe mentioning my bung hole is going too far.  The other execs would be jealous.\r\n\r\nPolly:  What I really meant to ask is whether it's not a bad idea to call this our best year ever.\r\n\r\nEE:  (blank stare)\r\n\r\nPolly:  With that whole Gulf of Mexico thing, I mean.\r\n\r\nEE:  Aw shit, I forgot.  Even still, the number of broken bones is way down in East Texas.  I continue to declare that this is our best safety year ever.  No, wait.  It's our best FUCKING safety year ever.

Good companies would thrive, bad ones would go out of business.  Boards of directors make sure the executives stay on the up and up.\r\n\r\nIt's a bitter truth, but that notion is entirely incorrect.  The past decade has taught me better.  Boards heap millions on top of millions on CEOs while average workers are told that the economic downturn keeps them from getting a raise this year.  Sure, they're free to move, but every company is the same.\r\n\r\nThen the companies get to the point where they're \"too big to fail,\" and the taxpayer is left bailing out banks and auto makers in the interest of saving our entire economy.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, corporate executives stay oblivious to all that goes on down here in the real world."

I went home and enjoyed another piece of birthday cake before going back to see the emergency vehicles lined up at the site of the accident.  (In my defense, I honestly thought she had swerved to miss the car, mishandled the curb, and fell into a yard.)\r\n\r\nI've got nothing else to add to this story; it's just something I look back on from time to time, and my callous response makes me chuckle.\r\n\r\nI've come to realize that in a very particular, somewhat subtle way, I lead a charmed life.  I don't mean that I was born rich (good looking and smart are plenty-enough of a head start in life), or that I had any advantages handed to me, or even that I'm lucky.  Anyone who has seen me bet on horse racing can attest to the fact that luck is not my companion.\r\n\r\nBut I seem to have some quality where I can get away with things that would get others in some sort of hot water.\r\n\r\nIt's easy enough to write off when the favoritism comes from my mother.  I'm the son, the first born, the one who looks more like her family, the one who's not a whiner.  Whatever the reason, I knew at a young age that I could get away with more than my sister.\r\n\r\nI called Mom out on it recently.  Mom's so straight that I'm certain she never cheated on a test.  She would never think of stealing a nickel.  She spent a year of high school living in a convent.  No shit.  So I didn't expect her to defend <a href=\"\/blog2\/archives\/104\">my story of how as a bank teller, I would steal a dime from each customer until I had enough to feed the coke machine every day<\/a>.  When she shrugged it off as no big deal, I countered that if I had grown into a serial rapist, she would be in the courtroom screaming, \"She was asking for it!\"\r\n\r\nMrs. theskinnyonbenny tried to point out this quality of my life some number of years ago.  I didn't believe her at the time, but it made me look for it, and I think there's something to it.  This week, I've done things in the course of my job that I thought would annoy those to whom I provided suggestions.  Nothing of the sort.  It was all so smooth.\r\n\r\nI'm open to the possibility that I do piss people off on the regular, but I'm just too oblivious to know.  And thinking about it now, that's really the more funny possibility.  I think we could write a movie about a guy who walks smilingly through life, giving people the red-ass, and unware all the while.  "

Here in after shall be referred as my client, On Friday, 26th May 2006, my client, His wife and their only daughter were involved in Benin petrol Tanker explosion incident that happened at Porga, while returning from site, all occupants of the Car unfortunately lost their lives. (You may view this site for more details of the incident) http:\/\/news.bbc.co.uk\/2\/hi\/africa\/5016532.stm\r\n\r\nSince then I have made several inquiries to locate any of my clients extended relatives but all to no avail.\r\nI am contacting you to assist in repatriating the sun of Eighteen million five hundred thousand dollars ($ 18.5 million USD) and properties left behind by my late client to your Country before they get confiscated or declared unserviceable by the bank. This deposits were lodged particularly, at the BANQUE ATLANTIQUE BENIN BAB where my deceased client has an account balance of Eighteen million five hundred thousand dollars ($ 18.5 million USD).\r\n                                      \r\nThe bank has issued me a mandate letter of ultimatum to provide my client heir or have his account confiscated as an unclaimed fund, but having been advised by my Colleague lawyers and some financial experts, I was asked to track His last name over the Internet, to locate any member of his Family to assist me make this claim and transfer the fund legally, hence I contacts you, since you shares the same last name with my late client.\r\n\r\nI hereby seek your consent to present you as a relative to my deceased client so that the Bank can transfer this fund into your Bank account, and then we will share the money equally at 50% to you and 50% me instead of aboundoning it with the Bank.I shall procure all the Necessary legal documents that can be used to back up every claim we may make.

Iâ€™m sure you think his name is odd.  It is considered odd in America as well, but we often put random periods in our names.  In fact, my own middle name is Bri.Applebutter, which is one of the traditional names in our family.\r\n\r\nI was last out to the Republic of Benin to visit uncle Eng.Michael and his lovely family in 2004.  What a charming group!  I found Benin to be a horribly hot and dry place, especially considering its dearth of liquor stores.  Fortunately my cousin (Eng.Michaelâ€™s daughter Laura.Basketball) was just back from university, and she had smuggled a little bit of alcohol back in her suitcase.  If I remember correctly, she had 12 bottles of Cuban rum, 24 bottles of Tennessee Bourbon, 9 bottles of Scotch, 11 bottles of tequila, and a half pound of choice marijuana.  She turned out to be a little slut, but she did have the ability to put away some booze.  Needless to say, we had quite a weekend!\r\n\r\nI remember warning my uncle against taking his family out to the oil tanker.  There was really no reason to have his wife and daughter out there is such a dangerous area.  It turns out that for some reason, they had a belief that mermaids swam below the tanker, along with giant starfish and aliens from the future.  They were most convincing that it was possible (especially after indulging in the marijuana), and I was almost myself convinced to travel to the sea in order to get a look for myself.\r\n\r\nAs luck would have it, I am a major stockholder in the BANQUE ATLANTIQUE.  It will suit my needs quite well if you turn over my inheritance to the bank, as they suggest.\r\n\r\nKindest personal regards,\r\nBen\r\n<\/blockquote>\r\n\r\nIf I've received any response to this, then that response did get filtered out.  \r\n\r\nIncidentally, I have no idea where spam messages to my work email go.  I have a Spam folder in my mailbox, but there are no messages there.  I find it impossible to believe that I'm not getting spam at that address (other than the one above).  I'll have to make a mental note to look into it.\r\n"

Tonight is Mrs. theskinnyonbenny's parade, so we will go catch that one along with whatever is rolling beforehand.\r\n\r\nBut that's not to say that it hasn't been busy.  This is the time of year where I'm all giddy and loving life, because the weather is warm but not too humid, the flowers are starting to bloom, and I can work, eat, and play entirely outside.\r\n\r\nOur season started with the Spanish Town ball, which <a onclick=\"window.open('\/pg3.php?spgmGal=070%20-%20Spanish%20Town%20Ball%202011','070SpanishTownBall2011','width=1024, height=768, toolbar=no, location = no, directories=no, menubar=no, resizable=yes, scrollbars=no');\" >you may have seen pictured<\/a>.  It is always a lot of fun, and this year was no exception.  We brought a full ice chest of booze down that afternoon, and left with a much lighter ice chest in a period of time that felt like about an hour but was probably closer to four.  Sharples and I probably took fifty pictures with strangers who liked our mermaid costumes on fat men.\r\n<!--more-->\r\nWe were smart that night and took a cab downtown.  Because mermaid costumes don't come with pockets, we carried no money or ID.  Amanda had one of our credit cards in case of some unthinkable emergency.  Then, many hours into the party, Sharples and Amanda were outside smoking.  Without warning, Amanda was outside smoking and Sharples was ass-over-head in a giant potted plant.  \r\n\r\nSharples goes through a few stages of inebriation.  He starts out pretty much like normal, but more talkative.  Then, he gets to the point where he talks even more, and has an expert opinion on any topic.  This sounds seriously annoying, but you really don't notice that because he gets all handsy and kissy, which trumps the other in annoyance.  Then suddenly, he's incoherent and has to go home.  \r\nThere's really no warning for this last part (thus the word \"suddenly\" in that previous sentence).  It just happens, and it is what it is.\r\n\r\nSo Sharples came out of the plant incoherent.  It was late, and we had called our cab driver to take us home.  They spotted him, jumped in the car, and headed out with our emergency credit card.\r\n\r\nMrs. theskinnyonbenny and I waited around for a while.  When it was clear that they were gone, we went outside and nabbed someone else's cab.  Then, our driver made the block, and we let some young couple share the ride with us (and pay for the bulk of it).  They were sort of well-dressed for this party, and they weren't lugging an almost-empty ice chest.  I'm pretty sure that they were frightened of us.\r\n\r\nThe next weekend was the dog parade.  We recycled the costume from a few years ago where Vanya was Tom Cruise and the dogs were hookers from Risky Business.  We went unrewarded on our first go-round, but V charmed <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wafb.com\/Global\/story.asp?S=469746\" target=\"_blank\">Diane Deaton<\/a>, and we took home the hardware for first place in the costumes this year.\r\n\r\n<table cellpadding=\"2\" align=\"right\"><tr><td width=\"5\" rowspan=\"2\"><spacer type=\"block\" width=\"5\" height=\"1\"><\/td><td width=\"250\" ><img src=\"\/img\/mutts2011.jpg\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td class=\"caption\" width=\"250\">Risky Business.  <a onclick=\"window.open('\/pg3.php?spgmGal=071%20-%20Krewe%20of%20Mutts%202011','071KreweofMutts2011','width=1024, height=768, toolbar=no, location = no, directories=no, menubar=no, resizable=yes, scrollbars=no');\" >There's a 30-pic gallery of all different pictures from Mutts this year.<\/a><\/td><\/tr><\/table>\r\n\r\nWe actually jumped the official parade and walked the route a few minutes ahead of the actual paraders.  After that, the humans in our group headed to one car while the dogs and I walked back to my Jeep.  Mrs. theskinnyonbenny had taken our bag of junk and our first prize back to the Jeep, so I had no scoop bag when Lily left a soft, stinking, giant turd in one of the yards.  We were too far to easily get to the Jeep and back, and there were a lot of other people around, so I didn't feel like I could leave it.  All I could think to do was to use one of my socks.  I figured it was ruined from walking the streets anyway, so I pulled it off and used it to scoop the hot pile of poo.\r\n\r\nThe following weekend was parade-free, but we spent all day Saturday sailing.  We had 10-15 knot winds with a light chop.  I kept the genny mostly furled, and we sailed flat but fast.  Had I been out single handed, I would have heeled her as far as I could.  I know I could have buried the rub rail in the water and had a roller coaster ride.  By myself, I also would have been naked as a jaybird.  Maybe one week soon."

Back when I was a college student, someone came up with the notion that on a home football game Saturday, they could get a couple of thousand people out to the Parade Ground at LSU, run through the Hokey Pokey, and get ourselves in.  It was pulled off the morning of an LSU\/Alabama game, and it was<!--more--> acknowledged as a record by Guinness.  I went with Big M (Big M was one of the of the most fun chicks I knew in college.  I don't mean that in a sexual way.  Really.) and the woman who would go on to become Mrs. theskinnyonbenny, and because Big M was so darn tall, you could find us in the crowd shot that aired on the local news.\r\n\r\nSeveral years ago I looked it up, and our record had been broken.  I'm okay with that, because I think our record was tainted anyway.  You see, the lyrics of the Hokey Pokey all but demand that the participants be in a big circle.  How can you do it without there being something to put your body parts \"in\" and \"out\" of?  But we didn't do that.  It was just a sea of people sticking body parts toward the speaker or away from the speaker.  If I was the judge, I would declare a flawed Hokey Pokey attempt, and head back to Guinness headquarters to get my next assignment.\r\n\r\nI was reminded by our tainted record this morning.  We listened to kids music while I drove Vanya to school, and the Hokey Pokey popped into the rotation.  It's just as impossible to perform while driving as it is while in a sea of people in the Parade Ground.\r\n\r\nBecause I'm an old man now, I strained my left shoulder during the left arm \"shake it all about.\"  It hurt for an hour or so.\r\n\r\nBut that's what it's all about."

Pretty much stayed home this weekend and did nothing you would be interested in.  I haven't been to the movies, haven't watched much TV, haven't stumbled on any brilliant new music, and I haven't come up with any new jokes about my poop.\r\n\r\nThen, I stumbled on a tweet from <a href=\"http:\/\/twitter.com\/slate\" target=\"_blank\">Slate.com<\/a>, that said, \"Amazing Amazon customer reviews for the Snooki book: <a href=\"http:\/\/amzn.to\/ibx8TX\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/amzn.to\/ibx8TX<\/a>.\r\n\r\nI started looking at those reviews, which made me chuckle, but which also made me thing, those aren't as good as the reviews for \r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Mountain-Three-Short-Sleeve-Medium\/dp\/B000NZW3J8\/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1295987292&sr=8-1\" target=\"_blank\">the Amazon wolf shirt<\/a>.

It will certainly be more entertaining than the rest of this blog post.\r\n<!--more-->\r\nAnd then that reminded me that I actually saw a guy wearing the shirt.  It was on our Las Vegas trip last summer.  I posted pics, but I hadn't really told stories.  What happens in Vegas makes me love you long time.  Or something like that.\r\n\r\nAnyway, there was a guy who joined me in the elevator, and he was actually wearing the Amazon wolf shirt.  I wanted to take a picture so much, but he looked like a Native American, and I did a quick estimation and come up with a 94% chance that the guy was an actual werewolf.  So I didn't fuck with him.\r\n\r\nI also saw a completely different guy by the pool who tried Chad Ochocinco's trick from the previous fall's Hard Knocks (remember, this was in the summer, before the Jets' Hard Knocks run).  Ochocinco advised the viewers to ask an attractive girl to borrow her phone.  Then, you call your own phone, and after that, you have her number and can put the moves on her via text message.  Maybe that works for the rich and famous, but for one guy by the pool this summer, it didn't go so well.\r\n\r\n\"Hey, my phone batter died.  Can I borrow your phone for a minute?\"\r\n\r\n(He was with three other dudes and didn't try to find an explanation for why they didn't have usable phones)\r\n\r\n\"Uh, no.  I'm not comfortable with that.\"\r\n\r\n(He should have aborted the mission right there.)\r\n\r\n\"Come on.  I just need to make a quick call.  It's local.\"\r\n\r\n\"Get out of here before I call security.\"\r\n\r\nFor a minute, I wished I was in their group, so that I could give the kid shit all night."

Go pull a book off a shelf.  Then, find the word and confirm how it's spelled.  Perhaps they will think about our ultimate frustration -- if we didn't know how it's spelled in the first place, how the hell were we going to find it in the dictionary.  Regular readers will understand what a horrible challenge this must have been for me.\r\n\r\nBut I didn't want to be taught how to find out how to cook.  I just wanted to boil an egg.  \"C'mon Mom, that won't be in there.  It's not a recipe.\"\r\n\r\n\"It will be in there.  Look it up.\"\r\n\r\n\"Please just tell me.\"\r\n\r\nShe refused.  I asked again.  She wouldn't relent.\r\n\r\nAll these years later, I understand that she didn't know how to boil an egg.  My guess is that she wasn't sure how long it should boil, since the rest of the process couldn't be more elementary.\r\n\r\nOf course, how to boil an egg is covered in <i>The Joy of Cooking<\/i>.  Since then, I've continued to refer to that book to find out how to make things that normal people should just know.  I referred to it today to figure out how to turn whipping cream into a whipped cream topping."

For another, the small house on the property doesnâ€™t appear to be large enough to hold the broken down display from January to November.\r\n\r\n<table cellpadding=\"2\" align=\"right\"><tr><td width=\"5\" rowspan=\"2\"><spacer type=\"block\" width=\"5\" height=\"1\"><\/td><td width=\"250\" ><img src=\"http:\/\/theskinnyonbenny.com\/img\/gal\/068%20-%20Holiday%20photos%202010\/resIMG_20101219_4777.JPG\" width=\"250\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td class=\"caption\" width=\"250\">The Santa on the Polar Express was one of the best that I've seen in many years.<\/td><\/tr><\/table>\r\nFrom there, we went to a train depot, built and maintained by nerd enthusiasts rather than by an actual railroad.  In order to share their locomotive love, theyâ€™ve created their own little Polar Express, where you roll through the woods, and end up at a fake North Pole.  A Santa gets on the train, takes pics with the kids, and then you get some cookies and roll back to the station.  It couldnâ€™t be more silly, but the little ones believed it, and it was fun to see them enjoy the trip.\r\n\r\nOn this train, Santa didnâ€™t ask the kids what they wanted for Christmas.  Which is a good thing, since Vanya never answered that question twice.  Early in the season, he only wanted a Zurg, a fairly minor character in Toy Story 2.  Since Toy Story 3 is out, itâ€™s quite hard to find toys from the prior movie, and Mrs. Theskinnyonbenny had to scour the internet good and hard to find a crappy Zurg for the low low price of fifty dollars.\r\n\r\nThe next day, we saw Santa at Baton Rougeâ€™s downtown festival.  After waiting a long time in line, Vanya got up there with Santa and immediately asked for a Superman.  When he got down off of Santaâ€™s lap, he asked, â€œSo where is it?â€� as he started to open Santaâ€™s fake bag to look for his toy.  I guess  I didnâ€™t explain how the toys are delivered very well.\r\n\r\nIt turns out to be just about as hard to find a Superman as it is to find Zurg.  The week before Christmas, we checked most of the toy stores in town and found nothing.  Finally, Mrs. theskinnyonbenny had the brilliant idea to go to a comic book store.  I happened to know of one next door to a sandwich shop I used to frequent, and they not only had a Superman, they had two.  And theyâ€™re pretty good action figures too.\r\n\r\nTwo days before Christmas, Vanya asked me if Santa would wake him up and ask what he wants for Christmas.  I told him that Santa probably knows by now what he wants.  He said, â€œGood, because I want to get a Megamind.â€�  Good grief.\r\n\r\nBy the way, Santa did not bring a Megamind.\r\n\r\nThis is running long, but here are a few other hits from the past month, which probably all deserved their own post at the time that they happened.\r\n<ul><li>If you received 2 Christmas cards, it's because we never sent out last year's.  Sure we could have thrown them away, but what a waste.  I thought the message in this year's card, plus the age difference made this clear, but I'm told that I am wrong on this count.<\/li>\r\n<li>Vanya came home from school with a home-made nativity scene.  Or at least the three primary characters in that scene:  Jofus, Mary, and of course Jesus, who is nothing more than a wood ball in a seriously small flower pot.  It's kind of neat that he made something that we can pull out with the decorations year in and year out, but he found it even neater that Mary and Jofus made serviceable action figures.  To  him, the capes mean that they can fly. \r\n<table cellpadding=\"2\" align=\"right\"><tr><td width=\"5\" rowspan=\"2\"><spacer type=\"block\" width=\"5\" height=\"1\"><\/td><td width=\"250\" ><img src=\"http:\/\/theskinnyonbenny.com\/img\/gal\/068%20-%20Holiday%20photos%202010\/resphoto8.JPG\" width=\"250\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td class=\"caption\" width=\"250\">Jesus, Mary, and Jofus<\/td><\/tr><\/table>\r\n<\/li>\r\n<li>As the Clarks and theskinnyonbenny family were walking through the Roosevelt Hotel in New Orleans, Clay ran into someone he knew.  He was behind us all, so we paused and waited for him to have a conversation.  I got bored, so I walked up behind him, and went into a humping motion near one of his legs.  When that barely distracted him, I said, \"C'mon Clay.  Let's go make sweet love.\"\r\n\r\nTurns out that the younger man he was talking to was someone they know from church and someone who has a kid who comes over and plays with their daughter.  The older man was that guy's father.\r\n\r\nThis gave Clay some distress, but we didn't know how much until an hour or so later, when we found him nose-to-nose with a stranger, threatening to kick his ass.  I don't really know the story there, but Clay had talked to the guy for a long time, and apparently, he was a real dick.  Clay could only take so much.  The bartender even said, \"That guy was making comments that you just don't make to strangers.\"  <\/li><\/ul>\r\n\r\nI also have <a onclick=\"window.open('\/pg3.php?spgmGal=068%20-%20Holiday%20photos%202010','068Holidayphotos2010','width=1024, height=768, toolbar=no, location = no, directories=no, menubar=no, resizable=yes, scrollbars=no');\">pics up from all of this<\/a>.\r\n"

You will forgive the dark, grainy photo.  We were forced to a stealthy cell phone shot, as we didn't wanted an honest observation of the master at his craft.  \r\n\r\nHe sat at a bar on Frenchman Street. And it wasn't one of those shoes-stick-to-the-floor dives on Frenchman St. It was a place with a little \"class.\"\r\n\r\nHershel kept his face toward his book as we approached the bar and ordered a round. But after a short pause, one of our party found herself unable to resist his pull. \r\n\r\n\"What are you reading?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm reading about the history of jazz.\"\r\n\r\nOf course he was. A pussy magnet of this caliber wouldn't be caught reading <i>Twilight<\/i>.\r\n\r\nHerschel's secret is that back at home, in the rare gaps between female guests, he is a regular guy. The fake beard is tucked away in a bathroom drawer, and a large painting in the den is removed to revel his high-def plasma television. (He tells his guests that he doesn't like television, except to occasionally watch Nova on his 13-inch black and white.)\r\n\r\nA close examination of Hershel's shelves reveal that the books are untouched. A couple of them are shelved upside down. But Hershel doesn't notice. The truth is, Herschel doesn't even know how to read. \r\n\r\nBut that matters not to a pussy magnet like Hershel. On the night we spotted him plying his craft, he had already had his way with a college student in town from Boston on a long weekend. His trotlines were set for conquest number two of that night. \r\n\r\nHats off to you, Hershel. "

I figured I could work in front of the games, pausing from time to time to make fun of whoever is playing at 2:00 in the morning, tedious overplayed commercials, etc.\r\n\r\nI gave it a good go, but hour after hour of games that you don't care about gets pretty old.  Also, it happened on a day where I had a lot going on and a lot of work to do.  But here's what I did write thoughout the 24-hour period:\r\n<!--more-->\r\n<div style=\"margin-left:4em\">November 15, 8:39 PM:  There's almost no chance that I catch the first tipoff at midnight. In fact, I probably won't catch halftime of Monday Night Football. I was up at 4:30 this morning for some unfathomable reason, and I plowed through a busy day and even ran for an hour. An Eagles blowout over the Redskins won't keep me up. \r\n\r\nNovember 16, 4;19 AM:  Just woke up and turned on the live game. This is really the most interesting time. Who do they get to play at such an awful hour?  Unfortunately, my glasses are in the bathroom, so I don't have a clue. It's a team in black and a team in yellow.\r\n\r\n4:31AM:  Central Michigan at Hawaii.  Makes sense, but even there, it's after midnight. I might be the only person in the country watching this game. \r\n\r\n5:17AM:  Hawaii by three, and we go to Stony Brook and Monmouth in progress. Really?  They couldn't have waited for us?  ESPN producers obviously had to go pretty deep into their Rolodexes to find two East coast teams willing to tip off at 6:00 AM. Monmouth fans:  There are plenty of good courtside seats to be had. \r\n\r\n6:00AM:  I can't believe that they have the real college basketball studio crew in there for the halftime show.  Are these guys going to plow through until midnight?\r\n\r\n7:09AM:  Monmouth misses the buzzer-beater.  Stony Brook wins.  Obligatory shot of students with their hands on top of their heads, and we're off to Robert Morris at Kent State.  Only a few Kent State students appear to have chosen class over basketball this morning, as I can make out individual cheering voices in the broadcast.\r\n\r\n9:42AM:  Live blogging is more difficult than it seems.  The whole notion is that I'm semi-imprisoned on the couch, and that you can see my sanity deteriorating with my words throughout the day.  But I spent the last couple of hours on coffee and breakfast, getting Vanya ready for school, dropping him off, and then taking care of errands that I needed to do.  I missed a whole game, and it's likely that I will never know who won the 7:00 AM Robert Morris\/Kent State game on November 16, 2010.  To make it worse, I <del datetime=\"2010-11-16T13:11:18+00:00\">have to go<\/del> get to go back to Vanya's school for their Thanksgiving party now.  So it's probable that I won't catch any of the Northeastern at Southern Illinois game that's on right now.\r\n\r\n11:14AM:  After listening to little kids dressed like Indians and Pilgrims sing, we did snack time. Up until then, I was well-caffeinated and felt good, but my 4:30 wakeup was starting to catch up with me as I left. I stopped at a convenience store for a gyros sandwich and to pick up a season preview magazine. Ate my sandwich through the last few minutes of regulation, and now Northeastern and Southern Illinois are in overtime. \r\n\r\n11:18AM:  These fans still sing na-na-na-na hey-hey-hey goodbye to sing when an opposing player fouls out of the game.  I thought that had been replaced universally by the \"left-right-left-right\" schtick, which is funny, but has gotten old too.  I hereby challenge the college students of America to come up with something new this season.  Look toward Duke. Those smart kids are clever. \r\n\r\n11:25AM:  Of all of these colleges I've seen play today, I only know the locations of Hawaii and Northeastern.  For Monmouth, Stony Brook, and Robert Morris, I don't even know the state. \r\n\r\n12:37PM:  Is there a University in the world with a worse name than Oral Roberts?\r\n\r\n12:49PM:  I've seen this commercial a few times.  Former LSU Baseball coach Skip Bertman talks up the benefits of getting a home loan from a local company that I thought was one of those fly-by-night-we'll-make-you-a-loan without-regard-to-whether-or-not-you-can-pay-it-back companies.  I'm 70% certain that someone at Cox accidentally queued up this commercial from a stack of ones made and run back in 2002.\r\n<\/div>\r\n\r\nAfter that, I got more caught up in work.  The games kept playing, and some of them got to be pretty good, but I didn't pay much attention after this, and when I did pay attention, I didn't write anything about it.\r\n\r\nI never noticed whether the studio crew plowed through or changed, but I did see that the Stony Brook courtside team was on a different game in the evening.  I do know that Oral Roberts is the worst name of any university in the world."

Blame the Madden curse, blame the new baby with the terrible name (Bowen Brees sounds like a too-sweet fruity rum drink that you would order at a horrible all inclusive resort), but whatever it is, it's not so much fun to watch.\r\n\r\nColt McCoy and his awful twangy accent came into our Superdome, threw for 70 yards, and came out with a win over the Superbowl champions.  So the routine as a Saints fan is back to the way the football gods intend it to be.\r\n<!--more-->\r\nBut normally, the football gods spare us a weekend where both the Saints and the Tigers lose.  LSU got beat in a game that really shouldn't have been as close as it was, by a team that is just better right now.  And Gary Danielson and Verne Lundquist found the replacement to Tim Tebow in their nightly fantasies.  They as much as said so right there on the broadcast.\r\n\r\nI remember a couple of comments.  After a 15-20 yard run, \"That's one for the highlight reel OF ALL TIME!\"\r\n\r\nOf all time.  I witnessed one of the best plays in the history of college football, and all I perceived was a pretty good run.  Guess I don't understand football very well.\r\n\r\nAfter a rare LSU tackle for loss, \"That's the best minus 9 yard run you'll ever see.\" \r\n\r\nIt's almost like they were putting us on.  Like they had a bet to see who could get his mouth deepest into Cam Newton's anus before a producer told them to knock it off.  They are just an absolutely awful announcing duo.\r\n\r\nIf you were wondering why you didn't hear Patrick Peterson's name called much, it's because Auburn's game plan was to not even look toward the side of the field where he was lined up.  If they threw his way at all, I don't remember it.  I remember seeing him on two plays, and they were both long runs where he came across from the far side of the field to be in on the tackle.  There aren't stats for QATHD (QB Afraid to Throw His Direction), so it will mostly go unnoticed.\r\n\r\nIn the World Series, I'll pull for San Francisco for several reasons.  First, when I cared about baseball, I was a NL fan.  Second, whatever the name of the ballpark in San Francisco is currently called, it's the greatest park in the sport.  Third, the Giants have two former LSU players that are integral to the team.  Fourth, it's another chance to pull against all things Dallas related.  It's a good enough argument that I might even watch a little bit, even though it would be the first baseball I've seen since the college season ended.\r\n\r\nThe NBA is starting too.  It's hard to care right now, and it's really going to be hard to support the Hornets.  Since Chris Paul isn't all-in, they're doomed to eternal mediocrity.  But Shaq and Big Baby playing together in Boston should be fun.  Might not be good basketball, but there should be some laughs."

I'm about five, <a href=\"http:\/\/princesssparklepants.com\" target=\"_blank\">my sister<\/a> two or three.  We're in front of Mike the Tiger's cage wearing 70s winter coats that might look stylish again by now, but were certainly ugly while the picture was displayed through the 1980s.\r\n\r\nThe photographer tried to get us to face the camera, but young Sarah wouldn't stop looking at the tiger.  So to be helpful, I grabbed her head and twisted it nearly 180 degrees.  When the picture was snapped, her chubby little hands have a death grip on the chain link fence while her neck and torso are twisted around for the picture.\r\n<!--more-->\r\nThirty and some odd years later, the tiger cage still draws old and young alike.  It's a rare moment in the day that there isn't someone at the mesh trying to get Mike's attention.  It's the standard meeting place for ticket exchange or lost visitors.  And it's impossible to look in on the live tiger and not feel awed, and for some reason, kind of happy.\r\n\r\nEarlier this week, I dropped off Vanya at his gymnastic class on campus.  To kill time, I walked over to see what was happening with Mike.  He appeared to be asleep, but very close to the cage where he was easy to see.  There were only two grown men trying to get his attention.  They thought that he was sound asleep or ignoring them, but I noticed that he moved the ear that wasn't pressed to the ground to point toward them.  He was listening.\r\n\r\nWhen they wandered off, I took their spot right in front of the tiger.  His shape and figure were just any house cat, but his paws looked like they were as big as dinner plates.\r\n\r\nI did a thing that often gets cats' attention:  I moisten my teeth with spit, and suck air through the front two.  It probably depends on the gap in the teeth, but mine make a squeak that I imagine might sound like a distressed rodent or bird.\r\n\r\nAfter a minute or two, I was about to give up.  But Mike rolled onto his belly, yawned (Those big sharp teeth in front are unbelievable.  I quickly thought about he could open me up and be eating my guts before I lost consciousness, because that's how my brain works.), and reached his front legs way out in front for a stretch.  He never looked my way.\r\n\r\nHe stood up, waled away from me to a spot near a tree, and pissed about a quart of tiger urine.  A minute later, I smelled it -- sort of a gamy smell mixed with the smell of straw, but based on the smell, I'd rather a tiger pee in my house than a house cat for sure.\r\n\r\nBy then, there were a few moms with kids showing up to see the tiger.  Mike went for a swim in his pond, and he went up to each window to greet the kids.  In most spots, he even stood still behind the children for long enough that the moms could get pictures.  I started an iphone video and captured when he came up to greet me.  (This one is a lot better than the one that I posted to facebook.)\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"http:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/15808491?title=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;color=666698\" width=\"600\" height=\"337\" frameborder=\"0\"><\/iframe>\r\n\r\nI watched him for a little while longer, and then it was time to go home."

It's a little ironic that the kids today don't have a good place to go drink without legal hassle, other than right out in the open next to traffic-directing policemen.\r\n\r\nIn years past, I might complain about the music.  If it were me setting up the playlist, we would be a mix of current alt rock, some classic rock (goes well with the whiskey), with a smattering of hip hop and current pop music.  If I were going to mix in country, it would be something kind of tough and ass-kicking.  A little bit of Johnny Cash goes a long way.\r\n<!--more-->\r\nFor some reason, tailgaters love that \"Calling Baton Rouge\" song.  How I wish they had written \"Calling Knoxville\" or \"Calling Tuscaloosa\" so that it could blare throughout their campuses on Saturdays instead of ours.\r\n\r\n<table cellpadding=\"2\" align=\"right\"><tr><td width=\"5\" rowspan=\"2\"><spacer type=\"block\" width=\"5\" height=\"1\"><\/td><td><img src=\"\/img\/blossom-tg.jpg\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td class=\"caption\" width=\"250\">Blossom sweats it out during a hot first weekend tailgate.<\/td><\/tr><\/table>\r\n\r\nIn all honesty, the music blaring around us this year hasn't been too bad.  But since I'm an old guy on a rocket-blast-screaming-full-tilt-shot toward grouchy old guy, they bug me by, well, bugging me.\r\n\r\nOne week, I forgot to bring a bottle opener.  A nice kid offered me his, which is great, but then every time I tried to jury-rig a bottle opener, the dude would show up and chide me for not finding him and his handy opener.  This didn't just happen a couple of times.  It happened over and over through the afternoon.  Finally, I just started bugging him for his opener, once causing a cute girl to get up from his lap so that he could fish out his keychain-bound opener.\r\n\r\nThat same week, we brought Blossom out for the afternoon.  The one dog lover who didn't bother me was a kid who silently came to give her some attention.  Over and over, he would come, pet the dog without a word to anyone, and then leave.  My guess is that he wanted to talk to one of the girls at his tailgate party, and he couldn't work up the nerve.  His subconscious directed him to the dog, knowing that he wouldn't face rejection from a Basset Hound.  He probably told himself over and over, \"Just one more visit to the dog, and then I'll go talk to her.\"  In retrospect, I kind of feel for the kid.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, lots of other people wanted to come talk to me about dogs.  Is it a boy or a girl?  How old is she?  What's her name?\r\n\r\nWHO CARES?  You'll never see this dog again.  Give her the piece of gristle that you got from your cheapo pre-made Piggly Wiggly hamburger patties and move along.\r\n\r\n<table cellpadding=\"2\" align=\"right\"><tr><td width=\"5\" rowspan=\"2\"><spacer type=\"block\" width=\"5\" height=\"1\"><\/td><td><img src=\"\/img\/chickenwings.jpg\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td class=\"caption\" width=\"250\">Cheapo chicken wings from Piggly Wiggly.<\/td><\/tr><\/table>\r\n\r\nEven worse are the ones who want to tell me about their dogs.  I heard about current dogs.  I heard about dogs they had growing up.  Labs, beagles, breeds I can't picture.  And over and over, my brain was saying, \"WHAT MAKES YOU THINK I GIVE TWO HAIRS FROM A SQUIRREL SCROTUM ABOUT YOUR DOG?\"  I really could not have cared any less about their dogs.  I just wanted to eat my cheapo Piggly Wiggly meat and watch the football game that was on TV.\r\n\r\nThe day after our first tailgate, I had kids I don't know getting on my nerves again.\r\n\r\nI took Vanya to the park.  I got him to playing with some other kids out there, which is pretty easy.\r\n\r\n\"Hey kid, what's your name?\"\r\n\r\nKid tells me his name.  Say it's Larry.\r\n\r\n\"Well Larry, can you run fast?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well he thinks he can run faster.\"  I point at Vanya, and then they spend an hour or so sprinting all over the playground.\r\n\r\nOn this particular day, I got him playing, and then I put together my fly rod and went about practicing my casting.  I was having a nice time, despite some odd looks.  But eventually, a little kid who had been watching curiously got up the nerve to ask if he could have a try.  Feeling like I should be an ambassador for the sport, I gave him a go.  But then I was instantly surrounded by a line of kids who wanted a turn for themselves.\r\n\r\nVanya was involved in a dodge ball game, so I started giving quick tutorials, unconcerned about their actual technique (and I can barely cast the damn thing myself, so teaching technique wouldn't have been any good anyway).  \r\n\r\nOne older fat kid was a terrible caster, but he really seemed to enjoy it.  He told me, \"I really like when my dad takes me fishing.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's great.\"\r\n\r\n\"But he's in jail now.\"\r\n\r\nJesus H. Christ kid, what the eff am I supposed to say to that?\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, someone yelled to the dodge ball game, and the whole flock of kids sprinted away to one of the picnic tables.  By the time I had gathered the stray fly line and walked over, I see that the table is surrounded by people singing Happy Birthday.  Vanya is smack center in front of the cake, directly across from the birthday boy.  He was easy to spot, being the only Caucasian at the table, and he was right were the back of his head would be in all of the pictures that his family was trying to take.\r\n\r\nThe family was nice about his intruder, and they fussed at me for not letting him stay to eat cake.  But I had had enough of strange children for quite a while."

		"post_content" : "After our vacation in Tennessee, theskinnyonbenny family drove due south, and made our way back across the Gulf coast.\r\n\r\nThis is the only part of this post that I'll devote to the oil spill:  as we drove through, we saw quite a bit of cleanup out in the water, but the water and beaches seemed clean.  But seeming clean is different than being clean.  I seem to be one of few, but oil that is broken into microscopic drops surrounded by chemical dispersant is still oil.  It's not out of the Gulf.  It's just not in a form where we see it.  Is it safe for swimming and eating?  I don't think anyone actually knows the answer to that.  So I'm pleased that it wasn't worse, but I'm still really concerned.\r\n\r\nNow that that's off my chest, I'll get to the point that I came to make:  I am now an expert on the different demographics along the coast.  There are several distinct regions with their own tourists, locals, personalities, and amenities.  I'm pleased to provide the first guide (as far as I know) to the different parts of the Gulf Coast.\r\n<!--more-->\r\n<img style=\"display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto\" src=\"\/img\/gulfcoast2.jpg\" alt=\"gulf coast map\" \/>\r\n\r\nThis is a map of the Gulf Cost, with highlights for the distinct geopgraphical and social divisions that I've observed.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/img\/gulfcoastkey1.jpg\"><b>The Sportsman's Paradise<\/b>  The part with few to no tourists, and which once upon a time had great fishing.  I actually extnd this through the first few miles of Mississippi, which in normal times is nothing but fishing vessels.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/img\/gulfcoastkey2.jpg\"><b>Casinos<\/b>  Where fat people come from all over the south to smoke cigarettes in detestable casinos, and where there is not one single decent restaurant.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/img\/gulfcoastkey3.jpg\"><b>Redneck Riviera<\/b>  Hillbillies from Texas to South Carolina flock to the white sand beaches of Alabama and Florida to stay in giant high rises, play miniature golf, eat fattning food, and buy crap at giant tourist trap shops.  It's a fine trip if you can sneak over during the school year, but during the summer, it's a place where overly religious SEC fans watch their fat rolls turn from fish belly white to lobster red.  \r\n\r\nI know that description sound comtemptuous, but it's an area that I've visited almost every year since childhood.  It's not that bad, and the sand and water is actually very nice.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/img\/gulfcoastkey4.jpg\"><b>Unspoiled Florida<\/b>  Once you get past the high rises, Florida's coast goes native.  Florida's native white trash look and sound a lot different than the tourists who are in and out in the course of a week.  They live in crappy little houses, often not even elevated houses despite being right on the hurricane prone ocean.  The Florida natives are easy to spot due to their overly tanned and weathered aligator skin.  Not aligator skin shoes or jackets -- their physical skin has actually turned to aligator skin.  Florida Gators indeed.  My experience is that the people are quite nice, which is a shame, since the places to stay are more often than not a category of hotel known as \"Shithole.\"\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/img\/gulfcoastkey5.jpg\"><b>The Forgotten Coast<\/b>  What?  Beautiful beaches with no high rises?  Nice houses?  Tons of land preserved as state park or national forest?  There's a little section of coast that is nothing less than lovely, and I've never heard anyone recommend the drive past the Riviera.  I'm not sure why.\r\n\r\nOn our trip home, we ended up staying for a couple of days in this little dot.  And my pleasant surprise is really worth spending another couple paragraphs on.\r\n\r\nSt. Joe's Peninsula might be the prettiest part of the Gulf coast that I visited.  Driving down the road, you see beautiful ocean front on one side and a nice, calm bay on the other.  It would be perfect for ocean lovers who still want to get out and enjoy boating on calmer water.  The houses that I saw from the road ranged from nice to fantastic looking, and the only drawback seems to be a lack of local restaurants and the fact that a whopper of a hurricane would wash the whole joint out to sea.\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"http:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/14049019?title=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;color=666698\" width=\"400\" height=\"225\" frameborder=\"0\"><\/iframe>\r\n<p class=\"caption\">Playing on a beach that we have entirely to ourselves.<\/p>\r\n\r\nWe stayed in Apalachacola.  The downtown area was cool, with lots of places to eat.  In fact, the best food that I've ever had in the state of Florida was at an oyster bar on a canal that looked perfectly mundane.  But the oysters were fantastic, and I had an aligator burger that was amazing.  If you're in the area, check out Up The Creek Raw Bar on Water Street.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, we checked into the Water Street Hotel, expecting a run-of-the-mill room, and we got a huge suite, with a view from a screened porch out over the swamp.  The price was super-reasonable.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/img\/gulfcoastkey6.jpg\"><b>Mosquitoville<\/b>  Many years ago, we went to a sailing school on an island off the coast here.  I would tell you all about it, except that on the second day, the mosquitoes kidnapped me.  They held me against my will for the rest of the week, occasionally giving me a beating, and raping me twice.  Other than the mosquitoes, it seemed a nice place for a visit.\r\n\r\n"

By the time he starts Kindergarten, he will have exceeded the amount of school instruction that I ever received in Music, Spanish, or Religion.\r\n\r\nMy nephew started his school year as well.

Watts Bar lake is a super long, deep, and pretty lake, and we had a good time boating and swimming on it for a week.  There are plenty of fish that jump from the water, but we never found a lure that they would take.  Fresh water is a lot nicer for swimming in, but their fish sure are picky.  Our rental house would have been nice if not for the rat turds, and if there were any way to get phone or internet service there.  I didn't realize you could still find spots that were completely unknown to one's cell phone.\r\n\r\nOne day, I needed an internet connection in order to do an hour (tops) of work.  I had to drive 30 minutes to Kingston, TN, which is still on the lake.  The only hotspot I found in the town is their local McDonald's, and the dining room was full of people with laptops fighting over their limited bandwidth.  In the hour I was there, my connection was dropped at least four or five times.\r\n\r\nI passed through Kingston one other time, but that trip was during the late evening.  We stopped at a gas station, and some of the local teenagers were playing grab ass while standing next to some of the pumps.  They had no car and no apparent reason for being there, but I guess McDonalds was probably full of business travelers trying to Skype back to their kids.  When one of them threw his lit cigarette butt into the oily mess on the ground, my mind started composing a country music masterpiece.\r\n\r\n<div style=\"padding-left:50px\">It ain't hard to be the smartest\r\nIn Kingston, Tennessee;\r\nI'm 'bout half retarded\r\nBut they're all dumber than me.<\/div>\r\n\r\nSince then, I've added,\r\n\r\n<div style=\"padding-left:50px\">There are forks in their chitlins\r\nBut not in their family tree;\r\nIt ain't hard to be the smartest\r\nIn Kingston, Tennessee.<\/div>\r\n\r\nIn my mind, the tune for that one is the Janis Joplin song that starts, \"Oh Lord, won't you buy me a Mercedes Benz.\"  I can make up lyrics, but the tune has to come from someone else.\r\n"

We were with the Linkin family, and it was this particular day that we had chosen to load four adults and four children into a single mini van, and take the scenic route to the east.  Our ultimate destination:  Dollywood.\r\n\r\nThe scenic route was just barely scenic, and even then, only once we were 90% of the way to our destination.  Mrs. theskinnyonbenny was navigating using a state map of Tennessee, and once we got close, we didn't really have any idea how to get to the park.  The highway we were traveling was littered with little shacks where you can rent inner tubes to float down their local river, and it was decided that I would go in to get directions.\r\n<!--more-->\r\nI pictured myself rolling out of a mini van (with Illinois plates) and into the shack with an obnoxious, \"CAN YOU ALL TELL ME HOW TO GET TO <I>DOLLYWOOD<\/I> FROM HERE?\"  But I found a room full of such simpletons, that my self consciousness evaporated immediately.\r\n\r\nThe directions that they gave were precise, but unfortunately, they were wrong.  The omission of a critical right turn left us pulling into the parking lot of a deserted Black and Decker repair facility where we expected to find the parking lot.  But at about that time, the iphones figured out where we were, and popped directions to the park on their little screens.\r\n\r\nWe ended up with a wiz-bang parking spot, right by the bus station for the ride to the gate.  The man talking over the loud speaker reminded us that we were at station D\/E, \"LAK DI-MONDE EAR-RING.\"  (It will be tempting for me to continue to type words in Tennessee twang, but if you promise to read it in their accent, I'll stop with the typing.)\r\n\r\n<table cellpadding=\"2\" align=\"right\"><tr><td width=\"5\" rowspan=\"2\"><spacer type=\"block\" width=\"5\" height=\"1\"><\/td><td width=\"250\" ><img src=\"\/img\/dollywoodrain.jpg\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td class=\"caption\" width=\"250\">Jake plays in the rainstorm while the rest of us wait under cover.<\/td><\/tr><\/table>\r\n\r\nAt the gate, I gave the lady an American Express card for the first of about 600 times that day.  And each and every time, I was informed that they don't take that card.  Throughout the day, I kept handing it over, just to cause them a similar inconvenience to the one that they had caused me.\r\n\r\nAs I changed over to a Visa card, the cashier asked me if we had ever been to Dollywood before.  \r\n\r\n\"Yes, but it's been 20 years.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, a lot of things have changed since then.\"\r\n\r\nI looked down at my receipt.  \"The price certainly has changed quite a bit.\"\r\n\r\nAwkwardly, \"heh heh heh, yes sir.\"\r\n\r\nYes friends, I actually went to Dollywood when I was nineteen.  Mrs. theskinnyonbenny was there with me, although this is many, many years before she married into the name.  We took about a week to cross Tennessee that summer, visiting Graceland, the Grand Ole Opry, Gatlinberg, Rock City, and Chattanooga in addition to our stop at Dollywood.  I'm just a few yards from a giant box of pictures, and somewhere in that box are photos of our skinny young selves on that trip.  I actually opened the box with the intention of finding those pictures earlier this evening, but the mass of 20 years of pictures and my lack of amphetamines make it an overwhelming task.  Someday...\r\n\r\nAs we passed into the park, someone asked the kids if they knew who Dolly Parton was.  The oldest one is only ten, so naturally, they did not.  I chimed in to tell the kids that she is an entertainer, most famous for her country music singing and her big boobies.\r\n\r\n<table cellpadding=\"2\" align=\"right\"><tr><td width=\"5\" rowspan=\"2\"><spacer type=\"block\" width=\"5\" height=\"1\"><\/td><td width=\"250\" ><img src=\"\/img\/dollywoodkids2.jpg\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td class=\"caption\" width=\"250\">The kids after the day at the park.<\/td><\/tr><\/table>\r\n\r\nBefore we went on a ride, we stopped to feed everyone.  Be careful of ordering a large drink in Dollywood.  It's pretty close to a gallon of fluid.  Picture carrying a gallon milk jug all over the park, and you'll have some idea about what you're in for.\r\n\r\nAfter the food, we went rode a huge stinking polluting steam train up a mountain, around a little circle, and then back down.  The ride was happily narrated with folksy witticisms from a guy in the back of the train.  It was not particularly fun, and it was even less fun when the old fart pulled back into the station and said that all of the rides other than the carousel, bumper cars, and one other thing were closed because of a storm in the area.\r\n\r\nWe high-tailed it off the train and into the carousel line.  Once that ride was over, the rain started falling, and the few rides that were open closed along with the rest.  It rained for an hour, during which time we stood under the roof of the bumper car building wondering whether we had driven two hours and paid $150 (just for theskinnyonbenny family) to ride a train and a carousel.\r\n\r\nAfter the rain stopped, the badness went out of the day.  It was still only around noon, and we spent the next several hours enjoying the rides.  The lady was right.  Twenty years ago, I remember there being one main roller coaster, and it wasn't much.  Now, they have many really nice roller coasters, and many rides that are safe enough for my tall little boy but still scary enough to make him cry.  He did enjoy the boats where you spray water on each other, and after that, we found a splash park, where the kids can soak themselves through and through.  Had we found that early, he and I might have spent the whole day up there.  Looking back, I really enjoyed this park.\r\n\r\nBrent and I spent the afternoon looking for the largest ankles on a woman that we could find.  Have you ever watched a football show where they show a rather close up view of a trainer wrapping a player's giant ankle?  We're talking about a 300 pound player, with an ankle that's swollen.  Those ankles wouldn't have made the top 20 biggest ankles of Dollywood on July 28, 2010.  We saw ankles with <i>rolls<\/i>.  Not just on one lady, but on several.  I don't think we could declare a firm winner, but there were four or five women whose ankles were the size of one of our kids' waists.\r\n\r\n<table cellpadding=\"2\" align=\"right\"><tr><td width=\"5\" rowspan=\"2\"><spacer type=\"block\" width=\"5\" height=\"1\"><\/td><td width=\"250\" ><img src=\"\/img\/dollywoodkids3.jpg\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td class=\"caption\" width=\"250\">The drive home.  Because of a critically low camera battery, I only got a handful of pictures from this day.  And only one of those includes any of the grown ups.  It didn't make the cut for this post, but when I get the whole photo set up on the <a href=\"\/pgHome.php\" target=\"_blank\">photo gallery page<\/a>, it will be there.<\/td><\/tr><\/table>\r\n  \r\nOn our way out of town, we stopped to eat, and I started to think.  If the population of the United States was replaced with just the population of Dollywood on July 29, 2010, the eight of us would be among the country's top one percent in both intelligence and beauty.  What a combo!  In that scenario, any of us could be president, Hollywood moguls, leaders of industry, or perhaps we would even be looked at as super heroes.  On the other hand, it would be a sad day for national diversity, as almost everyone there fit into the white protestant demographic.\r\n\r\nWe were all exhausted after the long day, and most of the kids dozed off on the drive home.  I confess that I worked in a power nap, and then kept my breathing deep and eyes closed to listen to the other grown ups talk about my sleeping.  Conversations are boring when I'm not awake.\r\n\r\nWe arrived back to the house during a downpour.  It didn't seem to take long to get the kids into the house, and they all dropped into their beds right away.  We had a tent set up on the deck for just such a weather contingency, so we cracked open the newly purchased liquor and head out for a nightcap.\r\n\r\nSuppose you're sitting outside at night, and a mosquito comes into the area.  Most of us would just apply bug spray.  The queen of the ultra-natural products does something else:  vinegar spray.  Perhaps it works, perhaps it doesn't (there was only the one mosquito), but it certainly stings any skin that has a sore or cut, and it makes everyone smell like an easter egg.  If I'm eating a salad, and you happen to be spraying the back of my neck, using vinegar would be quite nice.  Otherwise, I'll stick to something citronella based.\r\n\r\nMy rum went down easily, and the next thing I knew, it was 4:00 AM.  Can you imagine?  I would have said that it would be impossible for four adults to get up early, drive to an amusement park, spend the entire day herding kids through the park, drive back, and then sit up until 4:00 drinking.\r\n\r\nWe <i>are<\/i> super heroes.

I know it's just not that interesting, but when you have a little kid, you just don't get out that much and find other amusing things to write about.  I don't think it's a stretch to say that the quality of American writing is worse just because it's such a pain in the ass getting a babysitter.\r\n\r\nBy the time this posts, I will be days in on a trip to a resort with lots of bars and gambling -- a trip that includes many of the most fun adults that I know, and none of our children.  But until that trip has come and gone, you'll have to wait for stories fit for grown ups.\r\n<!--more-->\r\nUntil then, you'll have to settle for a quick note about Vanya's first triathlon.  He did the RocketKidz rookies tri on Saturday, and surprisingly, he really, really seemed to enjoy it.  It's a very well-organized event.  For the three and four year olds, the parent swims a short and refreshing lap with them, followed by a short lap on the bike, followed by a run to a finish line.\r\n\r\nAll of this was in a very nice park in North Baton Rouge that I have never as much as heard of.  If the park itself had a brain, it would have assumed that light skin was an unattractive deformity passed on to a few unfortunate humans (which is actually kind of true if you consider the evolution of man).  The park would have gone on to assume that the white minority had banded together to overtake the park and its surrounding areas, for the purpose of having a place to let our kids run.  Perhaps the park would think, \"What a shame -- that the ugly white children aren't allowed to play out there in the rest of the world.\"\r\n\r\nWe'll forgive the park its racism, because we're worldly enough to see the healthy wealthy children.  Many had serious competition level gear, and were there for business.  Others were scared, but most were just playful and eager.\r\n\r\nThe results of such a race are meaningless.  Parents could choose to drag their little ones through the pull at any rate they like, and some kids wore life jackets, etc.  But even so, Vanya was the very last little guy to pass over the finish line.  They went off in different groups, and he ended up not being the last place finisher when adjustments for starting time were made.  But that's two tris out of two attempts where the member of my house was last to cross the finish line, making it a family tradition.\r\n\r\nMy second favorite part was toward the end of the bicycle part.  I drew up next to him to go into the transition area with him, and he slammed on his brakes and came to a stop.\r\n\r\n\"What are you doing?\"\r\n\r\n\"I want you to give me a boost, so I'll go faster.\"\r\n\r\nOh.\r\n\r\nMy favorite part was at the beginning of the run.  One of the volunteers handed him a cup of water like they do in serious races -- never mind the fact that he was only 8 minutes of exertion into the race.\r\n\r\nHe stopped, drank it at leisure, and then carefully set the cup neatly and upright on the ground.\r\n\r\n<a onclick=\"window.open('\/pg3.php?spgmGal=062%20-%20RocketKidz%20Triathlon%202010','062RocketKidzTriathlon2010','width=1024, height=768, toolbar=no, location = no, directories=no, menubar=no, resizable=yes, scrollbars=no');\">My pics are here.<\/a>  Race results for the little kids are <a href=\"http:\/\/www.rocketkidzfoundation.com\/results\/2010%20ROCKET%20KIDZ%20ROOKIES%20TRI%203-4%20Overall%20RESULTS.HTM\" target=\"_blank\">here<\/a>.

Every spare cent that they make needs to be going toward buying and building and hiring people and equipment for oil cleanup.  Period.

To that I say, piss poor money management, redcoats.

One day, there was an article about the popular vacation destinations on the Alabama cost that included the tidbit that condos are providing guests with chemical cleaners to help them remove oily goo from their bodies.\r\n\r\nWho are the insane rednecks who are still swimming in the oily goo?

A pretzel, slice of apple, or even a sandwich will do.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday, I heard him say quietly to himself \"What's the big idea,\" and I suspected that this would come up in conversation soon.

Batman with much cooler costumes, Batman on a motorcycle, but I couldn't outweigh the appeal of Batman plus two other characters.\r\n\r\nThe thing with the other characters is important.  He already has at least one Batman action figure, so his marginal gain was just the general and the overweight business woman.  Surely even a four year old can recognize this as a stupid choice.  During the narrowing down process, I identified this as the ONLY TOY OUT OF THE HUNDREDS THAT WE PLAYED WITH that I really objected to.  \r\n\r\nBut when we tired of the incessant playing, his clear choice was this particular action pack.\r\n\r\nWhen we got home, I went to the internet to find out who the business woman is.  Nerd readers can set me straight, but I got that there's one series of cartoons where this woman is the super heroes' government liaison.  Since he actually has no powers, the super heroes delegate the governmental paper work to Batman.  I guess Robin, Zan, and Gleek are all dead or something."

Back then, it was out in the country.  My mother finished her childhood there with her four sisters, and there's some dispute about who was responsible for taking the one-legged grandmother who also lived there to the bathroom.\r\n\r\nOnce my mother's generation was grown, one of her sisters moved to that house, and all of her children grew up in that house.  Then, when she moved away, her son bought the place.  On that lot, he built two new houses, one of which he moved into, and one of which one of the other sisters bought.  What calls the Martins to this particular plot of land escapes me, but so it is.  All of this is to give you some context for what I'll refer to as \"the compound.\"\r\n\r\nWhen we arrived, we walked around to the back of the compound, starting a full weekend of sitting around, nursing a drink, and making fun of each other.  My first really good laugh was when my nephew turned to see an uncle pointing a rifle over the pool full of kids (he was using the sight to try to identify a particular bird of prey), which pretty much scared the bejesus out of him.\r\n\r\nThat night, many of us from my generation sat in the kitchen, eating a snack made out of saltine crackers.  They were tossed in some sort of oil and seasoning mix and then dried, so that they tasted similar to large Cheese-Its.  This is particularly funny, because the Martin women share a pickle recipe with something oddly in common.\r\n\r\nThe pickles are very good, and one time, Mrs. theskinnyonbenny asked me to find out how they were made.\r\n\r\n\"Do you know what the main ingredient is?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"Duh.  Cucumbers.\"\r\n\r\n\"In fact, you're wrong.  They start with DIFFERENT PICKLES!\"\r\n\r\nYes, my mother and aunts make pickles out of different pickles.  And now, I guess, crackers out of different crackers.\r\n\r\nI think that there's a cookbook idea there, and I assigned my cousins the homework of coming up with recipes for snacks made out of other snacks.  I'm going to try to make pudding out of Chips Ahoy.\r\n\r\n<table cellpadding=\"2\" align=\"right\"><tr><td width=\"5\" rowspan=\"2\"><spacer type=\"block\" width=\"5\" height=\"1\"><\/td><td width=\"250\" ><img src=\"http:\/\/theskinnyonbenny.com\/img\/gal\/061%20-%20JJ%20Wedding%20Weekend\/resIMG_20100522_2907.JPG\"width=\"350px\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td class=\"caption\" width=\"250\">This is what happens when you bring babies to weddings.<\/td><\/tr><\/table>\r\n\r\nSaturday morning was more of the same.  After a long nap, we dressed, and went to the park for the wedding.  It was very nice, and then I sweated through my shirt dancing and drank the bar out of gin, which is usually a sign of a good reception.\r\n\r\nFor some reason, I gave special treatment to the male members of the bride's family.  I gave her brother Josh a good, hard slap on the ass while yelling \"Wooooo,\" and it gave me pleasure to hear him lean over to another cousin of ours and say, \"That hurt like hell.\"\r\n\r\nLater, I gave my Uncle Larry sort of a clumsy but dirty shimmy where I started low and worked my way up to where I was looking into his uncomfortable face.  Come to think of it, my sister owes me a buck for that one.\r\n\r\nAnd then of course, packed into a cab with God knows who on our way to a local watering hole, I thanked her new husband in the manner I described above.\r\n\r\nSo maybe I won't even be invited to the next party.  But I had a good time at this one."

And that's a fine way to go through a sporting life.  I played baseball for many, many years before working my way out of the nine hole and right field, and I had fun all along the way.\r\n\r\nBut I ended up with a kid who thew his first spiral at the age of three.  He's as strong as a bull and freakishly fast.  Somehow, I ended up with an athlete.  Until it comes to swim lessons.\r\n\r\nSwim lessons have been an exercise of holding onto the side of the pool while crying.  Just like they were around this time last year.  He got through his first lesson without tears this afternoon, but no one was mistaking the kid at the far end of the pool for Aquaman.  Nevertheless, he was pretty proud of himself at the end. \r\n<!--more-->\r\nAs we drove away, he passed two joggers, running shirtless.  Vanya looked out his open window and shouted, \"Hey!  You running NAKED!\"  I'm not sure they made out what he said, but the one closer to our car looked over, so they definitely heard that he said <i>something<\/i> to them.\r\n\r\nI had told him that we could go play on the Indian Mounds if he got through swimming without crying, so we pulled into a parking lot, and climbed to the top.  I had my headphones with me, but it was a pretty evening, and I was enjoying the quiet.  There was a far away air conditioner and an occasional car, but mostly, it was just the sound of little bare feet running through the grass.  \r\n\r\nVanya ran up and down for a couple of laps, and then asked if he could catch a squirrel who was standing nearby.  Knowing that he was asking if he was allowed (not whether he had the ability), I gave him the green light.  So he chased them up a tree, and then he waited under the tree, noodling that since they went up, they would sooner or later come down.\r\n\r\nWhen I was young, I had a black lab mix named Flo.  Flo would do the same thing, oblivious to the fact that the squirrels went from treetop to treetop in our forested back yard.  She would wait at the bottom of a tree for six or eight hours some days, while the squirrels were off doing their thing wherever they wanted to be.\r\n\r\nFlo would also take the opportunity on cool fall days to nap on the warm asphalt road in front of our house.  Cars would pull up and crawl to a stop, the occupants thinking, \"Oh shit, I don't want to go tell these people their dog is dead.\"  But as the car came to a complete stop in front of her, Flo's tail would wag in anticipation of meeting the people.  Whack whack whack, the tail banged the asphalt.  She usually didn't get up until someone physically made her.\r\n\r\nThe sad thing is that Flo is the smartest dog that I've had.\r\n\r\nToday's squirrels didn't have the luxury of a jump to a neighboring tree.  We watched them from the ground, finding them easily by looking for the shaking leaves and magnolia blossoms.  Finally, one decided to get down.  He did so by diving straight down, hitting branch after branch, and finally launching himself toward the ground from about 12 feet up.  He hit with a good, solid thud, stood still for about two seconds, and then took off again.\r\n\r\nWhen we got home, we fixed dinner, played outside for a little while, and took a bath.  During bath time, Vanya decided to lead a game of Simon Says.  I hadn't realized until today that he knew the game.  Apparently, they play it in Episcopal School from time to time.  \r\n\r\nHis Simon Says couldn't be easier.  They ALWAYS start with \"Simon says,\" so you'll never, ever face elimination, and the instruction is always to touch a body part.  \"Simon says touch your knee.  Simon says touch your hair.\"  Like I said, it couldn't be easier.\r\n\r\nThis particular round started with \"Simon says touch your balls.\"  I chuckled and played along as Simon directed me to touch other body parts.  Most were innocent, but he also worked in \"touch your penis\" and \"touch your boobies\" along the way.  \"Touch your bottom\" is fine with me, although I'm sure it's just a matter of time until that turns into, \"Simon says touch your stinking ass.\"\r\n\r\nIt won't be nearly so funny when he pulls one of those during school."

		"post_content" : "Last night, Mrs. theskinnyonbenny told Vanya to stop doing something or other.  He ran over to me, crying, and sobbed, \"Mama, you don't love me anymore!\"\r\n\r\nThat's how I'm feeling about my blog this month.  I've got nothing -- and I mean absolutely nothing -- new going on that would be at all interesting to anyone.  Not that this stops me from writing most other months, but for some reason, it is right now.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I have a few notes on ideas to blog about that have gotten added and ignored for months.  So I suppose I could go back to one of those.  \r\n<!--more-->\r\nOne night when we were in New York, Amanda and Clay took our kid back to the hotel with them, leaving the rest of the grown-ups free to try a bar that Mrs. theskinnyonbenny had heard of.  The bar was called PDT (standing for Please Don't Tell), and going there definitely made you feel like a hotshot.\r\n\r\nTo get in, you have to phone their unlisted number that afternoon.  You can't call before 3:00, and by 3:15, they're booked up for the night.  Those of my approximate age will remember dialing their university's telephone registration system for scheduling classes.  Redial - busy signal - redial - busy signal - redial - busy signal - redial - busy signal - redial - busy signal.  You got to where the muscle memory was automatic, and then you got three seconds of stupidity, when your brain couldn't figure out what to do when the sound on the line was something other than the busy signal.\r\n\r\nI got through to PDT at 3:10, and I was invited to show up at either 5:00 or at 11:00.  We took the 11:00 seating.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner, we went to another place that Mrs. theskinnyonbenny had heard of, but there was a line outside, and Shelly couldn't use her crutches as a way to talk us to the front of the line.  It wasn't like one of those LA nightclubs where everyone in line is young and buff.  Most of them looked like dirty hippies.  But it was a democratic place, and we were in back.  So no dice.\r\n\r\nWe went to another place that wasn't noteworthy at all.  And then, before 11:00, we headed to PDT.\r\n\r\nWe had a filthy, sexually graphic in the cab, where I explained to the ladies among us that if a date goes moderately poorly, and if  the female is considering giving a hand-job, but nothing more serious, then the kinder thing to do is nothing at all.  Because the handshake that we can give ourselves is always better than what you ladies will be able to deliver.  I asked the cab driver if that was an abnormally nasty conversation or if that was pretty normal, and he seemed to indicate that it was somewhere between normal and the worst that he had heard.\r\n\r\nPDT has no sign, and it has no door to the outside.  To get in, you go into a hot dog stand.  It's a brightly lit, metal furniture, Dairy Queen-looking place.  To the side, there is an old fashioned phone booth.  You go into the booth, pick up the phone, and tell the person who you are.  The back of the phone booth opens, letting you into a dark and comfortable bar.\r\n\r\nThere are only a few tables, and then a long bar.  It was dark enough to pull out my joint at the table just to say that I did.  The fact that it went unnoticed might speak to the private nature of the tables, or it might merely reveal something about the size of my hog.\r\n\r\nThere's a large menu with drinks that taste like anything you can imagine.  If you like a good mixed drink, you will very much enjoy a visit.  If you find yourself in the area, drop me a note, and I'll send you the phone number.\r\n\r\nThe night ended very, very late.  2:00?  3:00?  I'm not sure.  I know that Mary Ann freaked out that the cab driver had taken us to a different borough on the way back to our hotel (he had not), and I know that Mary Ann's alarm went off at 4:30 so that she could jump up, leave, and make it to the parade (she did not -- at least not for another hour or two).  \r\n\r\nIt would have been nice to use this story to introduce a new site.  Mrs. theskinnyonbenny has promised to start publishing a blog about cocktails and bar\/restaurant experiences on <a href=\"http:\/\/therotgutfiles.com\">therotgutfiles.com<\/a>.  As you'll see if you follow the link, it just gets you back to my home page.  Please let her know that you want to start reading her work."

I know the engineers and the geologists brainstorming in a Houston conference room are smarter about these things than me, but when they're down to stuffing the hole full of tennis balls and used baby diapers, I think that maybe I could have come up with that suggestion in a shorter time span than three weeks.\r\n<!--more-->\r\nI've been meaning to post a detailed travel log, but from Easter Sunday until the following Tuesday, our family sailed out of the lake, into the gulf.  We sailed alongside dozens and dozens of boats harvesting the shrimp, oysters, and crabs.  We crashed into waves and took fresh, salty spary in our faces.  For 30-45 minutes, we enjoyed the company of a pod of dolphins, some of whom surfaced so close that we were looking right into each others' eyes.\r\n\r\nI'm glad that we went when we went, because I have no clue when the water will be clean enough to have a similarly enjoyable trip.  Four years?  Eight?  More?  I tend to be pretty optimistic, but it's really hard to stay positive.  \r\n\r\nAt least I can sail in a lake that's closed off by protective boom.  The white sand beaches of Alabama and the Florida Gulf Coast are going to have it much worse.  I love being a handful of hours from a nice beach, but when will that be true again?  They cleaned Valdez-spilled oil off of rocks.  How do you clean it off of grains of sand?  \r\n\r\nBut there will be time to worry about that later.  Right now, let's figure out how to stop the leak.\r\n\r\nCall my a cynic, but I'm fairly convinced that BP's first priority was to try to harvest the leaking oil.  They made the world wait a few days while they built a house-sized 70 ton chamber to funnel the leaking oil up to ships.  But the pipe to funnel the oil up froze shut, so nothing made it up to the ships.\r\n\r\nTo me, this is success.  I doubt the oil would have moved the 70-ton house.  And if there's a little ice keeping the oil out of the gulf, so be it.\r\n\r\nSo I don't get why they hauled this thing out of the water and went to plan B, which I guess still hasn't worked.  Headlines tonight say, \"BP could begin siphoning oil leak overnight.\"\r\n\r\nWhat the fuck?\r\n\r\n\"Could?\"\r\n\r\n\"Siphoning?\"\r\n\r\nHow about we just shut the whole thing down?\r\n\r\nLet me know where to send my dishtowels and tennis balls."

It was odd for Lily to not make it home, and a little distressing, as she was without her tags since her last bath.\r\n\r\nBlossom spent Friday whining for her friend, and then we left for a weekend at the farm Friday afternoon.  Then, over the weekend, Lily popped up in my sister's Facebook feed.  She gave me a call.\r\n\r\n\"Is Lily lost?\"\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\"Yeah, why?\"\r\n\r\n\"'Cause I'm a member of Lost and Found Hounds on Facebook, and there's a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/home.php?#!\/group.php?gid=9064382809&v=wall&ref= mf\" target=\"_blank\">beagle there<\/a> who was caught running around Baton Rouge with a Basset Hound sidekick.  It says that the Basset Hound 'Was not detained.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Hmm, yeah, that sounds like Lily.\"\r\n\r\nA couple of calls later, and Lily was home.  Alone, but home.\r\n\r\nAnd it turns out that without Lily, Blossom is a very good dog.  She didn't chase cats all over the farm like a maniac, she didn't jump on me with muddy paws in a desperate fit to hog all of the attention, and she didn't grab human food out of anyone's hand.  She also didn't eat Mrs. theskinnyonbenny's underpants, but she didn't really get the opportunity to do that one way or the other.\r\n\r\nWhen we got home Sunday and reunited with Lily, Blossom raised her fur and growled.  Everyone wants to be top-dog.\r\n\r\nAt this point, I'm a fair expert on how to tell a good dog from a bad dog, so I offer the following tips for anyone thinking of getting a dog from your local shelter.\r\n\r\n<ol><li>Don't get a puppy.\r\n\r\nBut puppies are cute!  Yes, they're cute for 6 or 9 months, then they're a pain in the ass for four more years.  And this post is about how to get a good dog.  Not how to get a cute dog.  Think you're going to be the humans who can keep their puppies from chewing up their family heirlooms?  Good luck with that, and don't say I didn't warn you.<\/li>\r\n\r\n<li>Get one that's fixed, or have it fixed as soon as you can.\r\n\r\nI won't lecture you on your responsibilities as a dog owner.  My interest is simply in your dog being good.\r\n\r\nLook at it this way.  You know how irritating your friends are when you hang out, and their only personality trait is horniness?  Well, they're the same species that you are.  A horny dog is even more annoying.\r\n\r\n(By the way, what kind of shitty spell checker doesn't have the word \"horniness\" in its dictionary?)<\/li>\r\n\r\n<li>Find the ones with the sad eyes.\r\n\r\nWhen you're walking through the animal shelter, and they're all jumping around and barking and acting like nuts, look for the one who seems sad or a little frightened.  Don't worry about having a chicken as a pet or being depressed.  Once you get the sad one home, show him his own bed in a quiet place, and give him some attention and a meal or two, you'll have a loyal sidekick for life.<\/li>\r\n\r\n<li>Don't get him a friend.\r\n\r\nDogs are pack animals.  Their loyalty will always be to the pack over the individual.  If you have have one dog, you are his pack, and he'll be loyal and true.  Add a second dog to the mix, and you just become one member of the pack.  If they want to go chase cats through the neighborhood, you can be outvoted.<\/li>\r\n\r\n<li>Treat him like a dog when you are by yourselves\r\n\r\nNo matter what a genius your new canine friend is, he's not going to distinguish that because he's covered in mud, it's suddenly against the rules to get into your bed.  Similarly, if you don't want his tongue all over the dishwasher dishes when people are over, don't let him do it when you're together.<\/li>\r\n\r\n<li>If you don't like being humped, stick to female dogs, and avoid even female beagles.\r\n\r\nYes, even female beagles love to wrap their front legs around you and give you the universal dog communication for, \"I'm dominating you, bitch.\"  This is true even if the beagle had sad eyes in the shelter.  My old friend Daisy wouldn't bite a bug, but she would hump anyone sitting quietly on the floor, including my mother and my friends' babies.<\/li>\r\n<\/ol>"

Parents should be informed about potential problems during the adoption process.  Parents should have programs to help them deal with children that they can't handle. \r\n<!--more-->\r\nTHEY DO!\r\n\r\nThe parents that adopted know that they have it.  The home study process doesn't just screen parents to make sure they have smoke detectors and locks on the bleach cabinet.  They give you information about likelihood of different problems that children can have (which is an overwhelming list, let me assure you), and they give information about state and social programs to help parents cope.  \r\n\r\nBy the way, did you know that alcohol during pregnancy is much, much worse for the baby than heroin during pregnancy?  Just a little interesting tidbit that you learn when you adopt children from countries where expecting mothers sometimes drink a lot of vodka.)\r\n\r\nAnd if you lost your paperwork, you can pick up the phone and call your state's office for children's services.  Your adoption agency can direct you to help that is free or close to it.  If there's a university in town, they may have a psychological services center that provides children services for a nominal cost.  Your pediatrician will be able to refer parents to programs to help the overwhelmed parent.  \r\n\r\nReports indicate that the woman in Tennessee took none of these basic steps.\r\n\r\nYou've paid taxes your whole life to support these services, so when you need them, use them.\r\n\r\nSo what happens for us?\r\n\r\nRight now we don't know.  The best case is that we have a delay before we get to go meet our second kid.  In the worst case scenario, it gets shut down, and we're finished before we start.\r\n\r\nThe articles I saw Friday and Saturday suggested that the US borders are already closed for Russian orphans.  But today's news uses language that suggests that this is just a consideration for now.  The United States is sending additional diplomats to Russia to address just this issue.\r\n\r\nRussian President Vladimir Medvedev spoke about it with George Stephanopoulos on ABC.  The adotopion question was at the end of the interview.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>STEPHANOPOULOS: I have to ask you about a case that has shocked people both in the United States and here in Russia. The case of the seven-year-old boy. Si-- Siberian boy. Ardev Siveliev (PH) who was adopted-- in the United States, returned back alone with a note pinned to his chest saying, I can't keep him anymore. You're shaking your head. You know about this.\r\n\r\nMEDVEDEV: Certainly I know and that's terrible and that young boy, Artyom Savyelyev, he simply fell into a very bad family. You know I would not like to finish the interview with the conversation on such a complicated topic, but I would like to say couple of things. first of all , it is a monstrous deed on the part of his adoptive parents, to take the kid and virtually throw him out with the airplane in the opposite direction and to say, I'm sorry I could not cope with it, take everything back is not only immoral but also against the law. And secondly what is now of my special concern, is the fact that the quantity of such cases in America is on the rise. We did have a couple of deaths of the kids which were adopted by American parents recently. That case thank God was without a fatal end, and without any bodily injury or trauma. Our agency responsible for kids' rights did react already to that. And even the minister of the department.\r\n\r\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Your minister has suggested freezing-- freezing adoptions. Is that a good idea?\r\n\r\nMEDVEDEV: You know any harsh decision is never either totally wrong or totally good. I believe considering that negative experience which has been accumulated in that department we should think with our American colleagues about some agreement between us about where the expectations which would outline very strongly the responsibilities of the parents which are taking the children from Russia, which will provide the monitoring opportunities of such a family. We should understand what is going on with our children, or we will totally refrain from the practice of adopting Russian children by American adoptive parents. I can only say we are alarmed by the tendency. This is very sad and I would like after the conversation with you, we would attract attention to that problem by American authorities. <\/blockquote>\r\n\r\nI can't say that I disagree with Medvedev there.  But really, there's already a process in place for that too.  At 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, and 3 years after a Russian adoption, you're required to have your same social worker visit, check up on things, and write up a report that gets sent back to Russia.  We just finished the visit for our 3-year report a couple of weeks ago.\r\n\r\nTennessee should have just recently gone through her six-month post placement visit, which means she would have had a social worker that she knows, sitting at her dining room table, asking to be told about any problems.  \r\n\r\nUnlike most issues coming out of Russia, there is new information every few hours.  I've been doing a lot of reading.  I probably won't continue to link articles, but here are three new pieces that have appeared since I wrote the bulk of this post yesterday.\r\n\r\n<ul><li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2010\/04\/13\/us\/13adopt.html?src=mv\" target=\"_blank\">NYT Article about the waiting<\/a>, including a profile of parents who have met their kids, and are now in limbo while waiting to find out if they can go finalize the adoption.<\/li>\r\n\r\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.themoscowtimes.com\/news\/article\/adoption-flap-not-expected-to-last-long\/403850.html\" target=\"_blank\">An encouraging writeup from the Moscow Times<\/a>, with better sources than U.S. papers have quoted.<\/li>\r\n\r\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/abcnews.go.com\/GMA\/mom-russia-adoption-scandal-child\/story?id=10358887&page=1\" target=\"_blank\">This is the first article I've seen<\/a> indicating that the horrible mother was in the process of trying to adopt a second child.<\/li><\/ul>\r\n\r\nIf you see others that are interesting, feel free to add links in the comments here, or send them to me via <a href=\"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Bens4lsu\" target=\"_blank\">the book<\/a>.\r\n"

Why oh why don't they spread some of this stuff out?\r\n\r\nEvery week, Baton Rouge has free shows on Friday evenings and Sundays at noon.  Many of the acts are very good -- our best local acts are up there with any town's.  On top of that, we have a Blues Week, Fest for All, Earth Day, and Corporate Cup race downtown, all featuring free live music.  New Orleans hosts French Quarter Festival (which perhaps has become my favorite), and Jazz Fest is right around the corner (which has fallen sharply in my list of favorites, because it costs $75\/day, and I can see the same local bands for free at all of these others).  I've never made it to Lafayette's Festival International, but that's supposed to be right up there too.  I should hyperlink to all of those sites, but that would be a lot of work.\r\n\r\nWith that in mind, I'm facing this weekend's premier of <i>Treme<\/i> on HBO with nervous trepidation.\r\n<!--more-->\r\n<object width=\"640\" height=\"385\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/v\/163CGlQCYPQ&color1=0xb1b1b1&color2=0xcfcfcf&hl=en_US&feature=player_embedded&fs=1\"><\/param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"><\/param><param name=\"allowScriptAccess\" value=\"always\"><\/param><embed src=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/v\/163CGlQCYPQ&color1=0xb1b1b1&color2=0xcfcfcf&hl=en_US&feature=player_embedded&fs=1\" type=\"application\/x-shockwave-flash\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" allowScriptAccess=\"always\" width=\"640\" height=\"385\"><\/embed><\/object>\r\n\r\nThere have been many, many, many movies filmed in New Orleans, and across the board, they get it wrong.  I'm sure the locals of any movie location feel that way, but the more authentic a movie tries to be about Louisiana, the more it fails.  Accents are terrible, the food is wrong, or they throw Mardi Gras in the summer.\r\n\r\nBut the creators of <i>The Wire<\/i> were lauded for getting the details about Baltimore neighborhoods, projects, and shipyards right.  And I spotted a slimmed down Bunk Moreland from <i>The Wire<\/i> (Wendell Pierce), who is actually from New Orleans, and of course, John Goodman, who has been a New Orleans regular and at least part time resident for many, many years.  All of this gives me hope.\r\n\r\nWriting about Bunk inspired me to go look up this scene.  It might be my favorite crime scene investiation in the history of television.  But don't watch if you're going to be offended by photographs of a dead naked woman or naughty words.  Or if your boss is likely to happen by. \r\n\r\n<object width=\"480\" height=\"385\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/v\/KQbsnSVM1zM&hl=en_US&fs=1&\"><\/param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"><\/param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"><\/param><embed src=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/v\/KQbsnSVM1zM&hl=en_US&fs=1&\" type=\"application\/x-shockwave-flash\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"480\" height=\"385\"><\/embed><\/object>"

Theskinnyonbenny family has been looking forward to our annual Easter voyage, but the list of boat chores was long, and I hoped to complete as many of those as possible before we left.  One chore -- repair of a ripped sail -- was a firm requirement do be done prior to departure.\r\n\r\nI didn't know until Sunday morning that I had an audience for most of my preparations.  On Sunday, I was headed down toward the boat when I noticed a mallard jump up into the cockpit.  I've never seen a duck board my boat before, so this gave me a chuckle.  Then, she disappeared, and as soon as she did, I got a sinking feeling in my gut.\r\n\r\n<!--more--><table cellpadding=\"2\" align=\"right\"><tr><td width=\"5\" rowspan=\"2\"><spacer type=\"block\" width=\"5\" height=\"1\"><\/td><td width=\"250\" ><img src=\"\/img\/duck.jpg\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td class=\"caption\" width=\"250\">Mama duck on her nest.  That's my speaker wire that drapes down in front of her.<\/td><\/tr><\/table>\r\n\r\nI climbed into the cockpit, got down on my hands and knees, and confirmed my fear.  She was sitting on a nest of eggs, build in the middle of my anchor rode.\r\n\r\nShe let me get right down in her face.  We were eye to eye, just inches apart, but she didn't seem to mind.  Eventually, I just got up and went about my work.\r\n\r\nThe question is this:  if she doesn't hatch those eggs this week, what do I do?  I'm thinking I'll try to slide the whole box -- anchor rode, eggs, and all -- out from under the seat and into a box that's set on the side of the dock.  That way, when we sail away, she should find the nest.  Although that means I would need to buy or borrow a different anchor rode.\r\n\r\nDucks are pretty stupid.  Was she planning to build them a ramp to the seat, and then another one up to the top of the gunnel?\r\n\r\nAnd isn't it true that something like 7 of 10 ducklings becomes food for a gator or a nutria?  In that case, wouldn't I be sparing them all a lot of heartache if I turn mama duck into a gumbo and the eggs into omelets?  (Of course I kid.  I understand that instead of delicious duck eggs, she's sitting on duck fetus.  Which is probably less delicious.)\r\n\r\nThere are actually a lot of nesting ducks out there.  I know of two others who had the sense to nest in bushes instead of in my boat.  In fact, my mother is bringing one of the nesting mothers a small bowl of dog food every day, which the duck seems to enjoy.\r\n\r\n<table cellpadding=\"2\" align=\"left\"><tr><td width=\"250\" ><img src=\"\/img\/duckmasturbating.jpg\"><\/td><td width=\"5\" rowspan=\"2\"><spacer type=\"block\" width=\"5\" height=\"1\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td class=\"caption\" width=\"250\">Masturbation is very awkward for the male ducks.<\/td><\/tr><\/table>\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the male mallards swim around with each other.  They're probably stupid too, and I assume that they're asking each other why they find themselves in the middle of one sausage fest after another.  \"A month ago, I was getting laid every time I turned around.  Now, all the females have disappeared.  I guess I'll just take care of number one by myself again.\""

We got our usual beautiful Saturday, where you can be cold in the morning and sunburned by evening.\r\n\r\nThe only downside to the day was that Vanya came up sick, leading to a day spent mostly asleep and mostly miserable.  Because of this, I got not so much as a picture of his annual custom shirt, which this year read, \"Irish sober people had adopted me.\"  It was further decorated with a couple of shamrocks, one of which was frowning.\r\n\r\n<table cellpadding=\"2\" align=\"right\"><tr><td width=\"5\" rowspan=\"2\"><spacer type=\"block\" width=\"5\" height=\"1\"><\/td><td width=\"250\" ><img src=\"\/img\/tomatillomary.jpg\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td class=\"caption\" width=\"250\">Tomatillo Marys are similar to a Bloody Mary, but they use fresh tomatillos instead of tomato juice.  With Mrs. theskinnyonbenny's, you can taste fresh cilantro and limes, and the pepper infused vodka gives it a kick.  I started my day with four of these.<\/td><\/tr><\/table>\r\n\r\nI also came up with a t-shirt for myself:  \"Irish you drunk motherfuckers would go home.\"  And for Mrs. theskinnyonbenny:  \"Irish I was as clever as my husband.\"  Alas, the division of duties put her in charge of T-shirts, and she chose to forgo custom shirts for the adults.\r\n\r\nThe day stared with a surprise arrival by Stacie and Mark, in from Dallas for the big day.  Mrs. theskinnyonbenny was finishing her fresh tomatillo-based bloody marys, and they were fantastic.  \r\n\r\nI tended to go sit with Vanya while he was awake, and as a result, I stayed more sober than usual, and even managed to fit in a couple of 10-minute naps.  In fact, I was sober enough that even at the end of the night, I failed to photograph my genitals on the camera that was left behind.  I'm not saying that the camera's photo sensor was completely unmolested, but there's nothing on its memory chip that I wouldn't be willing to post on this site.  Keep an eye on the daily photos.  \r\n<!--more-->\r\nIt also helped out a lot that I didn't cook (at least not on Saturday).  Jim took over crawfish duties, and I admit, when I saw how much cayenne he put in the pot, I was a little scared.  But it turned out absolutely perfect.  Some of the best seasoned crawfish that I've had.  There were also sweet potatoes in the mix, which I've never done at all.  That too was delicious.\r\n\r\nOne of my favorite things in boil is cut up pieces of sausage.  But not having the luck of the Irish, I twice got sausage bites that featured a little tiny bone chip.  To top it off, we went to The Chimes with Stace and Mark on Sunday night, and one of the sausage bites in my red beans also had a bone chip.  Am I just suddenly more sensitive to an integral part of the sausage-eating experience, or is Baton Rouge inundated with nasty sausage?  I really need to know this answer, but either way, I'm probably done with sausage for a while."

I should insert some sort of \"holy shit, we're getting old\" type of observation here, but the fact is, 40 doesn't really seem all that old any more.  Besides, I'm only 38.\r\n\r\nOur coming to town was a surprise for the birthday boy, and we went early to the restaurant where their family had dinner reservations.  Mrs. theskinnyonbenny and I sat at the bar, which was unfortunately located right in the line of sight as one walked in the door.  I jokingly suggested a code word -- Rosebud -- for when I saw their car in the parking lot, at which time we were to hit the floor and slide on our bellies around the back side of the bar.\r\n<!--more-->\r\nAbout the time when we started our second round, I looked over Mrs. theskinnyonbenny's shoulder, and I saw Crystal and one of their kids walk through the door.  I whisper-shouted \"ROSEBUD! ROSEBUD,\" and Mrs. theskinnyonbenny froze with her back to the door.  I positioned my face so that her head blocked me from the family's view, and they passed through without noticing us.\r\n\r\n<table cellpadding=\"2\" align=\"right\"><tr><td width=\"5\" rowspan=\"2\"><spacer type=\"block\" width=\"5\" height=\"1\"><\/td><td width=\"350\" ><img src=\"\/img\/winetray.jpg\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td class=\"caption\" width=\"350\">Mrs. theskinnyonbenny, still holding the wine tray.<\/td><\/tr><\/table>\r\n\r\nThey ordered a bottle of wine, and Mrs. theskinnyonbenny brought it to the table.  She took it right over to Brent, but having never waited tables, she had the bottle on a tray, with the label facing away from Brent.  He thought he just had a fool for a waitress and gave a sort of dismissive nod, putting his face back into the menu.  She made no move to leave, and he finally looked up at her.  It took a second for the annoyed look to turn into a smile.\r\n\r\nOn Saturday, Mrs. theskinnyonbenny sent Brent and me out with a shopping list.  It was a short list, but if there were six items on the list, we needed to check six stores to find them all.  By the time we were finishing it up, I suggested that the wives had already assumed that we were half-soused at the nearest bar, so we might as well make a stop.  But believe it or not, we didn't.\r\n\r\nFor some reason, as we shopped, Brent started discarding the bags and putting the merchandise right into his jacket pockets.  Once his pockets were full, I followed suit.  When we returned, I told Crystal that we had decided to shoplift most of the stuff, and her eyes got big and angry as we started emptying jacket pockets.\r\n\r\nSince we were there last, they've turned a standard-issue basement into a really nice bar, with big TV, pool table, and a really nice actual bar.  Other people starting showing up around 7:00, and by 3:00 AM, the party looked like this:\r\n\r\n<div style=\"text-align:center; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto\"><img src=\"\/img\/brentbirthday.jpg\" \/><\/div>\r\n\r\nThe reclined guy is the birthday boy, passed out for the night.\r\n\r\nIt reminds me of some photos that we need to find.  Many years ago, a group of us was at The Kerry, on Decatur St. in New Orleans.  An old lady passed out with her head leaning on the jukebox, and we proceeded to all pose and take pictures with her.  Because The Kerry hasn't changed a lick, I have no idea if this was 15 years ago or 6 years ago.  It's somewhere in that range.  I'll be certain to post those pictures if I come across them.\r\n\r\nThe only thing that I wanted to do but didn't get to is to pee my name in the snow.  Perhaps that's a sign of the aging, but it seemed like an awfully big pain in the ass to get bundled up in a coat just to trudge out there and take a leak.  Besides, we had snow twice in Baton Rouge this year and once last year.  I should start acting like I've seen the stuff before.\r\n\r\nI've got a few more pics, that I'll get posted as daily photos.\r\n"

		"post_content" : "Two weekends ago, when we went down for the NFC Championship game, Mrs. theskinnyonbenny and I were eating oysters and drinking our lunchtime cocktails at a restaurant called Bourbon House.  It happened to be the next shop down from the place where our dear friend Stacie had her rehearsal dinner, and my view out the window happened to be a place where the ladies dance in an exotic style.  Penthouse Club, I believe it might have been called.\r\n\r\nThis reminded me of a story I had forgotten.  Our friends from Boston -- Josh and Lisa -- newlyweds themselves -- arrived to Stacie's rehearsal dinner a little bit early.  Not finding anyone there yet, they decided to go grab a drink somewhere close, and Lisa suggested the place right across the street.\r\n<!--more-->\r\nJosh is a midwesterner, and over there, gentlemen are still gentlemen.  I've heard Josh say, \"shucks\" in frustration, and he wasn't even trying to be funny at the time.  When his new wife suggested a drink at the Penthouse Club, he assumed that his new wife was just clueless.  Amidst much stuttering and stammering, he managed to spit out an objection.\r\n\r\n<table cellpadding=\"2\" align=\"right\"><tr><td width=\"5\" rowspan=\"2\"><spacer type=\"block\" width=\"5\" height=\"1\"><\/td><td width=\"250\" ><img src=\"\/img\/stacieWedding1.jpg\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td class=\"caption\" width=\"250\">Wedding Pic -- Wasn't That Nice?<\/td><\/tr><\/table>\r\n\r\nLisa's response (read in a heavy Boston Accent) was something like, \"Theyah just boobies Josh!  Get ohvah it!\"\r\n\r\nI realize now that I haven't posted much about Stacie's big day.  There was one post where I offended the bride by referring to it as \"that wedding,\" but that's it.  I had started a long post about the weekend, but I never finished it up or posted it.  So sorry Stace!\r\n\r\nThe wedding was in the St. Louis hotel in early December.  It was one of the most fun weekends I've had in years.  My abs were sore for two days from laughing nonstop.  The group of people that came into town for this one were one of the most fun that I've been around, and the only thing that would have made it more fun would have been if Stacie, Mark, and Mrs. theskinnyonbenny had had enough time to roll from bar to bar with us throughout the day.\r\n\r\nI carried my camera around with me nonstop, but I didn't get too many good pictures.  I seem to have had a talent for capturing people with odd expressions on their faces that weekend.  Some of those are worth a chuckle, and I'll post a handful of my favorites as pictures of the day over the next few days.\r\n\r\nEnough time has passed to fade the flood of fun times that I had originally intended to share, but a couple of things still make me chuckle.  First, was texting from Lisa's cell phone while she was in the bathroom:\r\n\r\n<div style=\"padding-left:3em\">Lisa:  So, just between us, does Mark have a big joint?\r\n\r\nStacie:  I wouldn't know, being a virgin and all.\r\n<table cellpadding=\"2\" align=\"right\"><tr><td width=\"5\" rowspan=\"2\"><spacer type=\"block\" width=\"5\" height=\"1\"><\/td><td width=\"250\" ><img src=\"\/img\/stacieWedding2.jpg\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td class=\"caption\" width=\"250\">Try not to think about whether Mark looks like that new homosexual trust lawyer character on <i>Big Love<\/i><\/td><\/tr><\/table>\r\n(Lisa returns from the restroom and sees this on her phone...)\r\n\r\nLisa:  I'm SOOOOOO Sorry!  These guys had my phone while I was in the restroom.\r\n\r\nLisa:  But since they asked....<\/div>\r\n\r\nEvery response there was perfect, and they had me laughing for hours.\r\n\r\nAnother thing that still has me laughing is my mind's view of Shelly, sitting in a chair with her crutches propped precariously, using her hands to push her breasts up and to the center until they resembled a Venn diagram.  As I approached the scene, she was telling someone in her Jack Nicholson voice, \"You can't handle these titties!\"\r\n\r\nWe also learned that there's more to Carmel than the studious, dedicated mother who watches the kids at tailgate parties while reading religion textbooks for school.  She morphed into a tireless, wild, dancing fiend.  Perhaps she was so much fun because Eddie skipped the wedding to watch the Saints game, perhaps she would have been that fun anyway.  But we may have to start getting Eddie to stay home with their kids, so that fun Carmel can come hang with the grown ups.  \r\n\r\n"

I'm surprised to find myself a lot more affected than when LSU won either of their football championships.  Perhaps, in my mind, the Tigers were always a good team that would one day find their way back, while the Saints seemed to anyone to be one of those franchises destined to muddle through in mediocrity.\r\n\r\nBeing in the city after the game Sunday night was amazing.  It's possible that there's never been a single city at a single point in time that was so collectively happy. Maybe a lot of cities were that happy when the Nazis finally surrendered, but then again, there were a lot of grieving parents in that mix.  As I posted to Facebook, the Greeks weren't that happy to have beaten the Trojans (although I think I put the Spartans.  I doubt those were the same people, but that doesn't really matter.)\r\n\r\nEven with more printings, it's impossible to find a copy of Monday's <i>Times-Picayune<\/i>.

The stadium was ruined; talking heads urged the country to abandon the city altogether.  \r\n\r\nBut as Mrs. theskinnyonbenny put so well Sunday night, \"We won.\"  \r\n\r\nAnd she didn't mean the team.  She meant the millionaires to our left.  And the homeless guys to our right.  And the old people walking down the street who have been there their whole lives.  And those who came after the storm to build new homes.  And the fans from Baton Rouge who drive down to watch the game near the Superdome, because they can't stand the thought of missing the celebration.

If you can't stand the suspense, scroll to the bottom of the post to see it for yourself.\r\n\r\nLast Saturday, we had a few people over to watch the Saints game.  We ate buffalo wings and white beans during the day.  \r\n\r\nCulinary aside:  I (incorrectly) predicted that after a day of eating wings, beans, and drinking, that Mrs. theskinnyonbenny would have horrible complaints about my flatulence the next day.  I thought for sure that she would screech that I needed to see a doctor about the unnatural churnings of my body.  But it turns out that it wasn't too bad.\r\n\r\nV didn't go hungry throughout the day, but he wasn't much on hot wings and white beans either.  So in the evening, Mrs. theskinnyonbenny popped some leftover macaroni into the microwave for him and set the time.\r\n\r\nBoth she and our friend Lisa heard the microwave beep a few minutes later, and they assumed that it was finished.  In the course of three minutes, V was running wild in a different part of the house, so they went outside to drink, leaving the food in the microwave for when his little brain got back around to the request.\r\n\r\nSome number of minutes later, Mel went into the kitchen and discovered smoke pouring out of the microwave.  She roused me from a half-drunk full, content laziness on the couch by yelling, \"YOUR KITCHEN IS ON FIRE!!!\"\r\n\r\nI went in, opened the microwave door, and was immediately engulfed by smoke.  It wasn't just normal smoke -- it burnt the eyes and lungs most horribly.  Perhaps it isn't funny, but I had to chuckle at Mel's frantic attempts to herd the unherdable children out of the kitchen.  They were running wild, wondering what all the commotion was about.  Somehow, I noticed that there was still another 47 minutes to go on the microwave timer.\r\n\r\nWhile I was fumbling with trying to get the trash can over to the microwave, she snagged a potholder and had the smoldering mess out the back door in record time.  But by then, the smoke had filled the kitchen, and filled the ceiling area upstairs.\r\n\r\nSix days later, the smell is almost -- but not quite -- gone.\r\n\r\nSo on to the picture...\r\n\r\n<img style=\"text-align:center\" src=\"\/img\/burnt.jpg\" \/>\r\n\r\nYou will notice that there isn't much of the tupperware left.  Nothing was thrown away.  Any missing tupperware is melted into the burnt macaroni."

I would go through a throwing motion, but stopping the shoe suddenly so that the inertia would carry the unsuspecting poo into the leaves.  It wasn't really working, and on the third fling, I lost my grip on the whole shoe, and it went flying into the bushes.\r\n\r\nSo I walked down the steps, and started peering into the darkness around the bottom of the bushes.  I was sort of sifting through the dark and the leaves, and I found the shoe.  Amazingly, I did it without touching the poop on the bottom.\r\n\r\nBut my triumph was short-lived, as a millisecond later I put my stocking-foot square into yet another dog turd."

I've even had where I want to change the selection on the ipod that was playing in my ears, but couldn't find the ipod without following the headphone cord.  I eventually tracked it to the pocket in the pajama pants that I was wearing under my jeans.\r\n\r\nAlthough that sounds like the way Joe Fatass would dress, it seems to work quite well for me.  Except for the point where I snuck in a quick gym appearance between football games on Sunday.  Two old geezers were explaining to each other about the Saints-Cowboys game coming up.  Normally, I would keep my mouth shut and let fools be fools, but for some reason, I joined there conversation and let them know that the Saints would draw the Green Bay-Arizona winner.  They were skeptical, and I wasn't sure why, but I'm sure I didn't give myself any credibility by dropping my jeans to show myself standing there in food-stained pajama bottoms. \r\n\r\nTo make matters worse, the pool was closing, so as soon as I got changed, I rolled right back into the locker room to get dressed again without having taken any exercise at all.  Although this time, I just put on my jeans without the pajamas.\r\n\r\nToday is obviously much much warmer, and the sun is out, and the wind is still.

		"post_content" : "I am hereby making the following three New Year's resolutions:\r\n\r\n<strong>1.  Finish giving my songs star rankings<\/strong>\r\n\r\nThis is a chore that I've been working on for since <a href=\"http:\/\/theskinnyonbenny.com\/blog2\/archives\/134\">some time in 1995<\/a>.  I'm down to about 900 songs left to rank in a 17,000 song library.  And I've done this by listening to each and every song.  I no longer listen to them alphabetically -- at some point, Itunes threw me a curve by starting to ignore \"The\" and \"A\" at the beginning of song titles, and it screwed up my list.  At the same time, I was getting deep enough into the list that every time I added a new album, I had three of the songs from that album automatically sorted to the top.\r\n<!--more-->\r\nAnyway, 900 is a pretty easy quarter, so even if I add a lot of music, I should have no problem finishing during the year.  Then, my inner nerd can come out and do calculations to determine statistically which are the best albums, artists, etc.  It should be a hoot.\r\n\r\n<strong>2.  Do something about this gut.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nOn the surface, this seems like a very traditional resolution.  But I'm not looking for a six pack.  Or even a flat belly.  I just need to get back to the point where I look like a normal guy who drinks a beer every now and then, as opposed to a normal guy who consumes a pint of ice cream, a full pork roast, and a six pack every single evening.  \r\n\r\nNot too long ago, I went to put on my belt as I was getting ready in the morning.  When I reached for the belt loop, I found that I was already wearing a belt, and that my gut prevented me from seeing it.  That's 100% true, and I'm not happy about it.\r\n\r\nI know I don't have the willpower to eat right, so I'll try to eat poorly slightly less often, and I'm definitely going to make time to exercise again (that aspect was really missing in most of '09).  So far, I've spent two hours and eighteen minutes on exercise in the past four days.  That's not really all that good, especially since 45 minutes of that was walking the dogs a couple of nights ago.  But we'll see how this goes.\r\n\r\n<strong>3.  Update my site more often<\/strong>\r\n\r\nI don't know where I'll find the time, but I have a lot more to offer.  I have dozens and dozens of pics to post from two trips and a New Orleans wedding.  I have videos going back to summertime that I've not even viewed, much less filtered out the amusing and posted.  Getting together with friends leads to stories that make me laugh so hard that my gut hurts, but I relay almost none of it back to the internet.\r\n\r\nA big reason for that is when I sit down at my laptop, my brain is far, far away from the fun things in life.  I've always been able to keep work and fun separate, and they don't mingle easily in my mind.  If I get started, I can type all day, but getting started is trouble.  (That's why I'll often have two posts in a really short time -- I did it all in one flurry of writing).  \r\n\r\nFor example, here's one from over the Christmas\/New Year's holiday.\r\n\r\nOne night during the break, Mrs. theskinnyonbenny and I were out back having drinks with Crystal and Brent.  For some reason, Crystal handed me her cell phone (which she also did while drinking in Boston and during that wedding the week before -- not sure what she's doing there).  I took it inside when I needed a drink refill, and for no particular reason, I started scrolling through her contacts.\r\n\r\nI found one who I don't really know, but who I remember from their class reunion last summer.  She had texted him once before -- a generic \"it was great seeing you\" kind of thing after their reunion.  So I selected him, and sent a message.\r\n\r\n\"YOU'RE WRONG!  I did not have crabs during college!\"\r\n\r\nThen I waited a few minutes and sent this one,\r\n\r\n\"Sorry -- sent that to the wrong contact.\"\r\n\r\nDo you see how brilliant I am?  I completely added credibility with that second one without trying to explain, allowing the receiver to make what he would of it.\r\n\r\nThat led Brent to tell an unrelated story, save the appearance by the same parasite.\r\n\r\nHis college roommate's father came to stay with them and slept on the couch in their apartment.  God knows who they had on that couch, but the fathr caught crabs from sleeping there.  Then, he went home and gave them to the guy's mother.\r\n\r\nTo make matters worse, they were in college at UNLV.  Can you imagine coming home from a Las Vegas trip, giving crabs to your wife, and then having to convince her that there were no prostitutes involved?  Oh, what a nightmare.  I'm laughing all over again.\r\n\r\nI hear a good story like that one almost every week.  In 2010 a few of those might make the blog.\r\n"

This evening, I was shopping for books, and one of the recommendations was <i>The English Patient<\/i>.  I remember seeing the movie -- back when I did such things -- and I found it long, boring, and baffling.

Most of the others were more highly rated and more complimentary, but that was enough to keep me from pulling the trigger.\r\n\r\nBut I wonder, could it be that someone who actually liked the movie was a nutcase?  And if so, shouldn't I disregard that person's comments and take stock in the others' comments instead?  Or could it be that the book is more boring and baffling than the movie?  I don't need help falling asleep -- I need somewhere for my mind to go while I walk the dogs through the same neighborhood night after night.\r\n\r\nIf you've read or listened to <i>The English Patient<\/i>, I'd love to hear what you thought.

Perhaps that's why Vanya was such a pain in the mascot's thorax the second time they met.\r\n<!--more-->\r\nBug guy did all of the mascot things that you're supposed to do:  gave five, waved, handed out a sucker.

She spoke veeeerrry slooooooowly.  She sounded stoned.\r\n\r\n\"Yoooouuuu calllled (I'll quit typing that way now if you'll remember to read her words in a slow stoner's voice.\"\r\n\r\nActually, I started with, \"Hello, this is Ben.\"\r\n\r\n\"May I speak to Mr. Benjamin please?\r\n\r\nI'm already exasperated, and I don't know who this is yet.  \"This is he.\"\r\n\r\n\"This is so-and-so from the bank.

Sort of like I was bothering her, and she couldn't think of what tube we might have been talking about.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I just called to tell you that I don't have it.  It wasn't in my car, and I remember putting it back.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hmmmmmmm.\"\r\n\r\n(Awkward silence)\r\n\r\n\"Yeah, so...\"\r\n\r\n\"Hmmmmmmmm.\"\r\n\r\n(More silence).  \r\n\r\nThen, her again, \"Okay then.\"\r\n\r\nSo that's that, I guess."

Who would want to go look at bugs without a belly full of jellied goose liver?  In attendance were Mrs. theskinnyonbenny, Vanya, my two nephews Sam and Caleb, and my sister Sarah.\r\n\r\nOne thing Iâ€™ve noticed lately is that any time we go visit a restaurant, Vanya wants to be taken to the potty.  I think itâ€™s more a function of his inability to sit still than it is of bladder fullness, but itâ€™s a request that a parent has to respect no matter what.  I had taken him once â€“ a real pain in the ass, as he pulled off his shoes in order to get his Spiderman costume off, and then we pretty much had to redress again.\r\n<!--more-->\r\n<table cellpadding=\"2\" align=\"right\"><tr><td width=\"5\" rowspan=\"2\"><spacer type=\"block\" width=\"5\" height=\"1\"><\/td><td width=\"250\" ><img src=\"http:\/\/theskinnyonbenny.com\/img\/gal\/058%20-%20Halloween%202009\/resIMG_0970.JPG\" width=\"250px\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td class=\"caption\" width=\"250\">The touching of the maggots.<\/td><\/tr><\/table>\r\n\r\nLater, he asked to go again.  I gave him an okay, and in the course of climbing out from behind a table, he dumped over a glass of water.  We did the thing where everyoneâ€™s napkin gets put into the pool in a futile effort to clean up, and we actually managed a pretty good job.\r\n\r\nThen I turned around, and he was standing right behind me with the Spiderman outfit on the floor, just watching the proceedings from mid-restaurant while standing their in his little drawers.  Thatâ€™s my boy, I suppose.\r\n\r\nThe bug museum was as fun as I remembered it being, although the â€œtouch for yourselfâ€� part was a bowl full of maggots rather than the hissing cockroaches this time.  The spot where a huge spider comes out of the wall and scares people is always great fun, and I could have stood there and watched people startle all day long.\r\n\r\nAfter the museum, we went  back to Slidell, locked the kids in a closet, and went for a delightful sail.  <i>Velvet Elvis<\/i> has been missing me.  I need to get out there and give her some love.  Hopefully, it will be a warm winter, and weâ€™ll get to voyage a lot.\r\n\r\nEvening trick-or-treating was nothing especially exciting.  It was our first year with 100% comprehension of the process and of the rewards, and it was definitely fun seeing how excited the little ones got.\r\n\r\nAt one point my brother-in-law asked some young parents if their pint-sized wolverine had real knives attached to his fists.  They gave him a serious and concerned â€œno,â€� and then he walked off saying, â€œthose dummies thought I might really believe that they put knives on their kidâ€™s fist,â€� while the dummies walked off saying, â€œHe actually thought we would make knives a part of our kidâ€™s costume.â€�  I was in just the perfect place to see all of this, and it made me chuckle.\r\n\r\n<table cellpadding=\"2\" align=\"right\"><tr><td width=\"5\" rowspan=\"2\"><spacer type=\"block\" width=\"5\" height=\"1\"><\/td><td width=\"250\" ><img src=\"http:\/\/theskinnyonbenny.com\/img\/gal\/058%20-%20Halloween%202009\/resIMG_0909.JPG\" width=\"250px\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td class=\"caption\" width=\"250\">Batman Trick or Treats at the zoo.<\/td><\/tr><\/table>\r\n\r\n<i>Toy Story<\/i> came back with a vengeance in costume popularity this year.  I saw a number of little Buzzes with inflated wings on their back and at least one Woody, a tall skinny adult who never once said, â€œThey poisoned the waterholeâ€� or â€œYouâ€™re my favorite deputy.â€�  But my favorite was the weenie dog who had a woody tucked into his collar, presumably to rescue the squeaky penguin from the yard sale.\r\n\r\nOnce I get the pics posted, youâ€™re going to think Iâ€™ve mixed up different years, but in fact, Vanya started wearing Batman as soon as we got the costume, wearing it to Boo at the Zoo a week before, and then to a tailgate the following day, and although we had it with us on Halloween, he decided to change over to Spiderman for Halloween proper.  It will be good training for double celebration of holidays for once heâ€™s married and has to do them in more than one place.\r\n\r\nAnd finally, if you were wondering, no, I didn't dress as a female at any point this year.  If you're disappointed by that, invite me to a party next year.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

I eventually picked up Mrs. theskinnyonbenny, and we headed to the airport for a weekend trip to the Boston area.  (More on that in a future post.)\r\n\r\nThe bank branch started phoning Mrs. theskinnyonbenny, and they eventually left four messages complaining that I had driven off with their dumb tube.  They threatened a $50 charge to our account to pay for the tube replacement.  If they're going to charge that kind of change, they better have the video ready to prove that the tube rode off with me.  Of course they won't -- I would certainly know by now if I had the damned thing.  \r\n\r\nBut don't think I won't swing through their drive through, take a tube (without stating who I am -- can I borrow your car?), and come back the next day to return it as the one they think I stole.  Because if they do charge me $50, that's exactly what's going to happen.\r\n<!--more-->\r\nRest assured that I am not the one who took their tube.  Once upon a time, I was a drive-through teller, and every couple of days, some dingleberry would drive off with the tube.  Ususally, it was back within 15 minutes or so, but it meant that we had to close the lane and make all of the lined up people mad.  Would it be too much for each branch to stock a couple of spares?  Because of this, I am exceptionally conscious of returning the tube when I leave.\r\n\r\nToday, I called the branch to tell them that they were barking up the wrong tree, but that branch's chief tube detective is already gone for the day, and apparently, the chief tube detective is the only one qualified to deal with this problem.  And by the way, they're closed tomorrow.  The lady started going through a schedule of when I might try to call back when I offered the alternative of leaving my number so that the chief tube detective could phone me as it fits into her busy schedule.  Tracking down missing tubes is a booming job in this tough economy.\r\n\r\nWhile we're talking about drive-through banking, I might as well share some things that made me the world's worst drive through teller:\r\n\r\n<ul><li>When I would get thirsty, I would short the next five customers in a row ten cents each.  Then, I would go to the coke machine and buy a fifty cent coke, making my drawer balance and solving the problem of my thirst.  I did this nearly every day.<\/li><li>While I counted the money from the barbecue and seafood hut down the road, I would shamelessly beg the man to bring me his lunchtime leftovers the next day.  Often, he cam through for me.  I don't think that place is open any more, but it was damned good.<\/li><li>If no free barbecue was in the works, there was a back door just for the drive through.  I would sneak out, walk across the parking lot to Popeye's, and come back and eat chicken sitting indian-style on the floor.  That way, the waiting customers couldn't see me eating chicken instead of waiting on them.  Once, I got busted by the branch manager eating on the floor while the lines were around the building, but all I got was a, \"Hurry up and finish that chicken!  The lines are around the building!\"<\/li><li>I once sent $400 and change out to the wrong lane -- where a depositor by name of Clyde Ennis took the cash and denied doing so.  We didn't have cameras out there, and it was my word against his, and he got away with it entirely.  I'm 100% sure of where I sent it -- as sure as I am that I didn't steal Capital One's tube on Tuesday.  You'll notice that I remember the name 15 years later.  At some point, I might be in a spot to do a favor for Mr. Ennis.  Baton Rouge is a pretty small town.<\/li><li>Although I didn't participate, there was an occasional substitute teller who enjoyed being really rude to the customers, and I egged it on for my own amusement.  She would tell chew them out for not buckling in their children or refuse to take the money that was sweaty from being between giant breasts in an un-air conditioned car.  I could make no such refusals since I was permanently assigned to my branch.  Breast-sweat money was a constant part of my day to day life back then.<\/li><\/ul>\r\n\r\nNow if you'll excuse me, I have some old fishing lures and pocket change that I need to put away.  I keep them in the garage in stolen drive through tubes.\r\n\r\n"

His construct is to start with a question that asks if the listener knows what the other person said.  Then, he repeats the person's name and what they said.  So, for example, if I ask Mrs. theskinnyonbenny to turn down the television and she doesn't jump to it right away, he might get her attention and ask,\r\n\r\n\"You know what Papa say?\"\r\n\r\n\"What?\"\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\"Papa say turn down the TV.\"\r\n\r\nA couple of nights ago, he came to me in the kitchen with,\r\n\r\n\"You know what Mama say?\"\r\n\r\n\"What?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mama say I can eat cookies for supper.\"\r\n\r\nReally?  Papa say, was I born yesterday?\r\n\r\nThis attempted deception aside, he's been pretty well-behaved the last couple of weeks, getting mostly \"green fish\" at school.  Fortunately, he doesn't remember the promises of what he could have and do should he get seven or eight consecutive green fish, because that seemed such an unrealistic goal that I'm sure we might have actually promised something outrageous.  Like an okay to eat cookies for supper.\r\n\r\nPerhaps this is personal growth or increased maturity, or perhaps it's because we cut off superhero cartoons.  Today's superheros aren't the joyful Superfriends of my youth.  They're a serious group with problems that aren't always solved at the end of the episode.  They also get into a lot of fistfights, which isn't good for a three year old boy with a lot of energy.\r\n\r\nOne of our favorites is Teen Titans.  If you haven't caught this one, it's Batman's sidekick Robin and a band of four other young super heroes, living in a high-rise shaped like the letter T.  They get into life and death situations, often without leaving their high-rise.\r\n\r\nWhen we started watching, Vanya asked me about each character.  \"Who's that?\"  Except for Robin, I didn't know.  I went to the cell phone to check the Wikipedia writeup.  The cartoon's page led me to the biography of each character.  And extensive biographies they were.  Not only did they explain how these characters ended up on Earth with powers, but they went through relationships, breakups, allegiances with other bands of heroes or villains, and much, much more.  I honestly couldn't follow it all.  No wonder comic book nerds end up wasting their lives away amid giant stacks of comics -- that might be the only way you can keep up with it all.\r\n\r\nTeen Titans was long over by the time I got around to explaining who these people were.  But I didn't stop my research project.\r\n\r\nFrom there, I went to Superman's writeup.  What would he have if these minor losers had more content than I could understand?  You can check for yourself, but apparently there were multiple versions of Superman, and eventually, multiple universes where Superman was having separate simultaneous adventures.  My head aches just thinking back on it.\r\n\r\nAnd all this time, I thought he was just a kid launched from Krypton who found Lois Lane, flew around the world backwards to save her life, and then stopped Richard Pryor from ruling the world and stealing fractions of pennies."

		"post_content" : "\"She has two speeds:  slow, and stopped.\"\r\n\r\nThat's the quote that an ex-husband of a mutual friend said about Crystal.  We've taken hold of that quote, and we repeat it regularly every time we have to wait for her to get ready to go somewhere.  Which is to say, we use the phrase every time theskinnyonbenny family is in the same city as Crystal's.\r\n\r\nWhen we were in Maine, Mrs. theskinnyonbenny tried to combat slowness by setting firm times by which we were supposed to be out of the house an on to some adventure.  She wasn't unreasonable about it â€“ we were up until 2:00 or 3:00 every night, and then we had six adults, four kids, and one bathroom.  But be it 10:00 or 10:30, the clock inevitably ticked closer and closer as Crystal relaxed in pajamas, watching the world pass by.  \r\n<!--more-->\r\nOne morning, she garnered some sympathy from me by sleeping late and then claiming, \"I just want 15 minutes to savor my coffee.\"  I thought that sounded reasonable, until Brent gave her away.  \"She doesn't even drink fucking coffee at home.\"\r\n\r\nThe Saturday of Mrs. theskinnyonbenny's class reunion was no different.  We had planned to leave their class barbecue and take my mother-in-law's boat out on one of the local lakes.  About the time that we started rounding up kids and saying goodbyes, Crystal decided to eat a hamburger patty.  That was fine, we sat and talked and \r\n\r\nShe\r\n\r\nAte\r\n\r\nEver\r\n\r\nSo \r\n\r\nSlowly.\r\n\r\nIn 20 minutes, she had eaten about half.  Mrs. theskinnyonbenny asked if we were ready to go, and I jerked my head to the half-eaten patty to my left.  Crystal was surprised.  \"Oh, were you waiting for me?\"\r\n\r\nEither that or another ice age.  Either way.\r\n\r\nShe eventually got up to say goodbyes, and then it became apparent that the goodbyes were going to take a really long time.  So Brent and I left on our own.  We had a long drive anyway, to drop off my kid and pick up the boat at my in-laws' place outside of town.\r\n\r\nWe got up to the house, I put Vanya into dry clothes, and I threw him into his mother's childhood bed for a nap.  As I came out, we received a rather complicated set of instructions for picking up the boat, which was down by a farm building with tractors and equipment.  If the gate looked locked, we were to check and see if it just had the chain wrapped around a post, but not really locked.  If it did turn out to be truly locked, there was a hiding place for a key that we were to look.  If the key wasn't there, we were told, \"We'll have to see about finding the Mexican.\"\r\n\r\nSure enough, the gate was actually locked.  We found the hidden key, but that opened one of the three padlocks on the chain, but not the one that was actually holding it closed.  So, I hopped over the fence to see about finding the Mexican.\r\n\r\nAt first, it appeared to be an easy task.  Just beyond the gate was a large shed\/shop type of building.  A large garage door was open.  We walked through, and a Mexican lady was rolling dough and mixing a green liquid in the blender.  She and I found ourselves unable to communicate, but Brent broke out some Spanish and managed to ask if she had the key.  More impressive yet, he was able to ascertain that her husband had the key out in a pasture somewhere.\r\n\r\nWe left the shop and boarded a gasoline-powered four-wheel-drive golf cart type of thing.  I drove, bouncing down a dirt road, around a curve and over a hill so that civilization was completely obscured.  We bounced through the countryside, passing cows, and the ubiquitous white birds who hang around cows.  After a bit, we saw a plume of dust in the sky.  Going through a gate, and pulling closer, we saw that the plume was created by a tractor cutting hay.\r\n\r\nI made a turn, zipping through a flock of birds, scattering them through the sky.  I circled wide around the back of the tractor and pulled alongside what would have been the driver's side, had it been a car.  The man driving wouldn't have been more surprised to see two gringos pull up in a Mardi Gras float.  Brent managed to blubber out enough Spanish to get the keys from him, and we took back off toward the shop.  \r\n\r\nWe opened the gate and returned the keys to the woman, who was now clearly in the middle of making tamales in the middle of the big room.  Going back to the trailer, we found that there was a flat tire.\r\n\r\nThe trailer had a spare mounted to its front, but naturally, the lug nut wrench in my Jeep didn't fit the nuts on the trailer.  Back in the shop, we searched and dug until we found a single, tiny socket wrench and some sockets.  One of them fit the lug nut, and Brent started to change the tire.  \r\n\r\nBut the wrench wouldn't budge.  I couldn't move it either, so I put the handle horizontally and stood on it.  That didn't help, so I started to bounce up and down.  I felt is starting to turn and announced, \"Here it goes.  I got it.\"\r\n\r\nBy the time I got to the word \"it,\" I was on the ground, and the socket wrench was in two pieces.  It hadn't been turning; it's metal had been twisting.\r\n\r\nAbout that time, Mrs. theskinnyonbenny called.  She and Crystal had left the reunion and were sitting in a nice cool air-conditioned bar wondering where we were.  They decided to order another round.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, I called my father-in-law to see if there might be another socket wrench somewhere nearby.  He said he was close by, and that he had what we need in his truck.\r\n\r\nSeveral minutes later, he was there, and MacGyver would be envious of his preparation for all things gone wrong.  An air compressor on the back of the truck refilled the tire.  We could hear a hiss, so he added a connection to the air hose, and with a NASCAR \"whirr,\" the nuts were unscrewed in seconds.  Hot and thirsty?  He had a jug of cold water in his back seat.  Within 10 minutes, we reconnected the trailer to the Jeep, and we were on our way.\r\n\r\nWe stopped for gas and some giant cans of beer served in paper bags.  Amazingly, this was our first beer of the day.  (Believe it or not, there had been a barbecue in Louisiana that included only water and soda.)  We got to the boat ramp just a few minutes before the women. \r\n\r\nMrs. theskinnyonbenny sat at the helm, and I backed the trailer into the water.  She went to lower the prop, and got nothing.  No power, no radio, nothing.  Back out of the water we came, and we pulled slowly out into the street.  Had we been smart, we would have pulled out the battery and run that through town to Wal-Mart, but we weren't smart, so we crawled through the town's narrow streets with a ton of boat, finally arriving at Wal-Mart much later than we would have otherwise.\r\n\r\nThe battery exchange went off without problem, but it did require a manager to stick her little key into the register keyboard, so we had to wait around a while for that.  Then, we put the new battery in the boat â€“ everything worked.  Back to the slow route through town to the launch.\r\n\r\nI don't know how many hours it had been.  This day felt like a month.  But we finally got on the boat, out on the lake, and had a very nice time.  The day want' over â€“ we crashed a party that someone was having along the river, met classmates downtown for dinner, and then had another story worthy adventure while trying to pull the boat out of the water.  But that can wait until another post on another day.\r\n"

Vanya had been running around wild, and every light in the house had been on, so the sudden dark and quiet was disconcerting.\r\n\r\nI had the laptop on, so I got him to sit with me and watch an online stream of The Simpsons, both for something to do, and to calm him down.  After he went to bed, I had eenough battery for a couple more shows, so I just vegged out until my battery was completely cooked.  By then, it was 11:00, and I was surprised that it was still dark.  I went out back, lit a cigar, and walked the block to make sure someone was working on something or other.  Satisfied that they were, I sat out back, finished my smoke, and read a crappy story on the iphone's Kindle application until that battery was dead too.\r\n<!--more-->\r\n<table cellpadding=\"2\" align=\"right\"><tr><td width=\"250\" ><img src=\"\/img\/vanyapoweroutage.jpg\"><\/td><td width=\"5\" rowspan=\"2\"><spacer type=\"block\" width=\"5\" height=\"1\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td class=\"caption\" width=\"250\">Watching a cartoon on the laptop during a power outage.<\/td><\/tr><\/table>\r\n\r\nBy then, it was 1:30, so I gave up on seeing the return of power.  I had put Vanya in one of the downstairs twin beds, and to spare Mrs. theskinnyonbenny from my snoring, I went and got into the other one.  As soon as I had drifted off, I heard the loud thunk and crying of a kid who fell out of bed.\r\n\r\nI picked him up, put him back in the bed, and tucked his blanket up to his face.  He was sniffling, cute and calm and sweet.  Then, he wanted to go potty and get some juice, so we turned on our headlamps and went through these tasks.  I carried him room to room, held him while he drank juice in the middle of the night, and tucked him in for the second time.\r\n\r\nIt's so easy to pacify an anxious three-year-old.  You know exactly what he wants:  a safe blanket, a shoulder for his tired little head, a glass of juice.  Earlier than that, and they don't realiably tell you what's wrong.  And later in life, your kids' demons become more and more complicated, until they're teenagers and you have no clue what's bothering them or how to provide comfort.\r\n\r\nAs I layed down and tried to sleep again, I listened to a story on my ipod.  It was a sad story of a father who had let down his familiy in the worst way possible.  It made me glad for the life that I have."

I'm not sure it will translate to a typed web page, but I'll get it finished and get it posted this weekend.  I've got another post in mind for next week, so I might be getting back into the swing of it.\r\n\r\nUntil then, here are a couple of thoughts from the last few days.\r\n<!--more-->\r\n<center><img src=\"\/img\/greenline.gif\"><\/center>\r\n\r\nIf you go into Hemingway's Tobacco on Jefferson Highway on any given weekday afternoon, there are a group of old out of shape dudes, shooting the shit and smoking cigars.  Despite the fact that they smell bad and have yellow teeth, I'm more than just a little envious of them.  Sitting over source code while shooting the shit and drinking coffee in one's necktie just isn't the same.\r\n\r\n<center><img src=\"\/img\/greenline.gif\"><\/center>\r\n\r\nRegardless of where you are, football is the usual topic of discussion right now.  The average Baton Rouge citizen knows a lot more about college football than the average voter in the polls.  I just don't know what the current voters are watching on Saturdays.  I saw Oregon beat Cal by something like 35 points.  Who would you rank more highly?  What about when you sit down to rank undefeated Iowa and Penn State, whose only loss was at home to Iowa?  How could you possibly put Penn State first?\r\n\r\nThe answer is that the \"experts\" are still relying on who they think should be good.  Preseason polls are fine, but you have to throw them out on week one.  The first weekend of the season, almost all of the big boys beat up on directional schools.  BYU beat Oklahoma.  They would have been my #1 pick the next week.  Does that mean the spot is there until they lose?  Not at all.  I throw it all out the window and each week vote for the teams that have the most wins over quality opponents.  Easy as that.\r\n\r\n<center><img src=\"\/img\/greenline.gif\"><\/center>\r\n\r\nAgain this year, I'm in the underdog pool where we pick an underdog who might win outright, and if they do, we get the number of points by which the other team was favored.  I've picked four winners in four weeks.  Unfortunately, one week I picked a team that wasn't an underdog, but my big play was Washington over USC for 19 points, which has me in the lead right now.\r\n\r\nWhen looked at in aggregate, the quality of the picks from this group is unbelievable.  I guarantee that if you bet these picks -- either on the money line or with the spread, you'll be a winner.  From here on, I'm going to keep track of it to prove that I'm right.\r\n\r\nAnd then next season, for a low subscription fee, you'll have access to these picks, which will be much more reliable than most of the pay to handicap sites that are out there now.  We'll use some of the subscription money to sweeten the pot for our winner, and we'll split the rest among ourselves.  I love this idea.\r\n\r\n<center><img src=\"\/img\/greenline.gif\"><\/center>\r\n\r\nSorry Chicago.  If I had known you would be eliminated, I would have tried to watch.  A packed area of stunned silent people is high comedy in my book.  <a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=EuE60mq0r1Q\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=EuE60mq0r1Q<\/a>\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Ohhh no, you aren't hallucinating. This isn't deja vu. The partner couch to one of the hottest pieces of furniture in the history of the internet is up for grabs. I'm honestly not even sure why I'm posting this under furniture -- it should be under casual encounters because after you put this bad boy in your house, your genitals may very well fall off due to overuse. In the days of yore in early 2009, a matching love seat was purchased by two fine gentlemen for a mighty sum of $1500. Now is your chance to own a piece of history.\r\n\r\nFor those of you too young to remember a couple of months ago and for those of you who might not have had the internet, you must realize that this is the chance of a lifetime. This is one sweet bone-sled. I cannot confirm, but it is widely believed that the reddish-burgandy, Mallard green, deep-ocean blue, and yellow-gold striped fabric that adorns this masterpiece was woven of Milwaukee Brewers legend Robin Yountâ€™s chest hair and pubes. Its unique coloration means that it can blend in equally well in your garage, vineyard, or pyramid. Personally, I â€œutilizedâ€� it in the back of a conversion van for a while. Worked like magic. Or the roofies worked like magic. Whatever.\r\n\r\nThis piece comes with two fresh-ass throw pillows that will visually dazzle your guests if you have them over for a dinner party, or will physically dazzle the smalls of their backs or buttocks if you have them over for a totally righteous orgy or Mandingo party.\r\n\r\nAs for the seat cushions, they are made of seductively-scented foam and conform to your ass like your uncle's firm grip. Ladies, I can guarantee you that these cushions will really impress your modestly-endowed boyfriend with a crew cut and a few ironic tats and puka-shell necklace who lies to you about having a job while heâ€™s actually out\r\nin the streets of Dupont on weeknights giving sans-lube wristies for a chunk of change for that gift certificate to Claireâ€™s that he got you so you could get your cartilage or belly-button pierced or whatever it is you kids do these days.\r\n\r\nWhat has four strong legs, is very rare and soft, but will totally fuck your shit up? Two-fold answer. A saber-tooth tiger, and this sick piece. Owning this bad mofo is like having the Natural History Museum and a tanning bed (!) right inside your very own home. So if you really want to get your swerve on, come pick this up in Rosslyn. If you come during the day, bring sunglasses or at least a pirate patch and a strong penchant for squinting, because its glory is blinding in sunlight. If you come at night, bring a sword and a suit of armor because in moonlight it turns into a wolf.\r\n\r\n    * Location: Rosslyn\r\n    * it's NOT ok to contact this poster with services or other commercial interests\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/img\/craigslistcouch.jpg\" alt=\"\" \/><\/blockquote>\r\n\r\nMrs. theskinnyonbenny just recently tried and failed to sell a similar looking sofa on Craigslist, and it didn't exactly move all that quickly.  The one interested couple that I met was put off by the pet hair intricately weaved into the fabric.  I can't help but think that we should have claimed that it was chest and mustache hair from Tom Selleck.\r\n\r\nAlso, the keen observers among you might notice a tab on my broswer for \"TPS Reports.\"  That's not a goof.  I really am working on something called TPS Reports.  To date, I have not been asked to add a cover sheet to each one.\r\n\r\nBy the way, if you aren't taking the occasional peak at <a href=\"http:\/\/yousuckatcraigslist.com\" target=\"_blank\">yousuckatcraigslist.com<\/a>, you're denying yourself a couple of chuckles each day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

A story in which her son is a donkey won't compute at all.\r\n\r\nSince it's been a number of weeks, I'll go ahead and spill it.\r\n\r\nOn the afternoon of August 14, I connected my in-laws' boat to the back of my Jeep, went to the house, loaded all of our gear (including two dogs and a kid), and headed out for Natchitoches, LA.  Mrs. theskinnyonbenny was expected at a high school reunion event at 6:00 PM, and the town is three hours away, even without pulling a boat.  On top of that, her folks' place is 20 minutes on the other side of town, and we had to stop there first to get rid of the boat, kid, and dogs.\r\n\r\nWe left Baton Rouge aroud 2:30, and within a half hour, I felt myself wanting to nod off.  Truth be told, I hadn't slept at all the previous night.  I stayed up late working and watching old movies, and I didn't go to bed until 3:30 or 4:00.  At 4:30, I heard Vanya crying with some sort of nighttime crisis.  By the time I got him calmed down and comfortable again, the morning sounds of dogs barking and garbage truck pickup clued me in to the fact that I had missed my chance to sleep.\r\n\r\nBack on the road, we stopped at a truck stop, and Mrs. theskinnyonbenny went inside to buy us some lunch.  I knew it wouldn't be super-quick, so I used the opportunity to catch a quick nap while she was in there.  I felt much refreshed once she returned.\r\n\r\nWe got back on the road, ate our sandwiches, and progressed farther and farther away from civilization and toward an area best known as, \"the middle of nowhere.\"  When we just about as far from any real town as it was possible to be, I noticed that we needed gas.\r\n\r\nI knew Mrs. theskinnyonbenny would be mad.  I should have filled up when we stopped.  But I didn't.\r\n\r\nI was watching, watching, watching for that next exit.  Towing that huge boat was causing that fuel needle to drop much more quickly than I was used to.\r\n\r\nAnd then, the gas pedal quit working.\r\n\r\nI pulled over to the curb, out of gas 45 minutes after having stopped at a gas station.\r\n\r\nIt's a difficult position.  I was right next to Mrs. theskinnyonbenny who was madder than a mean cat in a bucket of water.  And I had no defense, no excuse, nothing that would explain why we were sweating in Louisiana August heat while cars zoomed past.\r\n\r\nI called the state police, but the nearest trooper turned out to be more than an hour away.  He took care of getting one of us to a gas station and got us back running.  But the hour we waited was not fun.\r\n\r\nI guess it was probably around 7:00 by the time we got to the class reunion.  Everyone had eaten already, so the drinks during the night hit harder than they should have, and by the grace of the power of the bottle, we ended up having a pretty good time.  We were out until 2:00, so I didn't really get caught up on sleep that night, but that just set up the next day to be one of the most eventful that I can remember."

We were on a mission.  We were to rent a party barge.\r\n<!--more-->\r\nA 4-hour rental was about $120, an absurdly reasonable entertainment for four adults and four children.  We got a 60-second briefing on the boat and about the lake.  The only notable item from our briefing was that we could cross under the bridge from the small side of the lake to the larger side, but that we would need to lower the bimini in order to get across.\r\n\r\n<table cellpadding=\"2\" align=\"right\"><tr><td width=\"5\" rowspan=\"2\"><spacer type=\"block\" width=\"5\" height=\"1\"><\/td><td width=\"250\" ><img src=\"http:\/\/theskinnyonbenny.com\/img\/gal\/056%20-%20Maine%20Trip%202009%20-%20vol%202\/resIMG_20090805_0286.JPG\" width=\"250\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td class=\"caption\" width=\"250\">Passing under the too-low bridge.  You can still see the antenna trying to recover from its bending.<\/td><\/tr><\/table>\r\n\r\nAt first, we thought we would save ourselves the hassle, and we stayed on the small side of the lake.  But after a while, our inner Lewis and Clark called for us to explore the water beyond the bridge.\r\n\r\nThere were a line of motorboats puttering slowly through the channel.  We fell into the queue, set an appropriate speed, and watched the bridge approach.\r\n\r\nThe bridge looked awfully low.  Ladies started to get nervous about whether we would fit.\r\n\r\nI know that it always looks for a second like the sailboat mast won't fit under a bridge, even when there's a good 10 feet of clearance, so I assured everyone that we were just witnessing an unsettling illusion.  But as we got closer and closer, it appeared that it would be extremely close.\r\n\r\nWe couldn't turn back, as other boats had fallen into line behind us, and the channel didn't really allow enough space to make a u-turn in a pontoon boat.  We were committed.\r\n\r\nWe made the kids duck down low, and started through.\r\n\r\nIt couldn't have been closer.  If I had sat up straight, the steel beams of the bridge would have bashed me in the nose.  We all ran our hands against the metal just overhead.  A few feet above it, cars zoomed across.\r\n\r\nI looked back, and Brent -- our pilot at the time of the crossing -- was in a mad scramble, trying to unscrew the radio antenna, which was the lone extension of the boat that was absolutely not going to fit under the bridge.  Between the two of us, we ended up pulling the radio antenna in a backward curve, so it wouldn't be snapped against the metal of the bridge.\r\n\r\nAbout ten minutes later, as we were stopped and swimming on the larger lake, I noticed that it was an old-fashioned telescoping antenna.  All we had to do was shove it down.  Who would have thought?\r\n\r\nComing back was less nerve-racking, because we knew we would fit, albiet barely.  We did go through a little more quickly, so it's good that none of the kids suddenly decided to stand.  \r\n\r\nIn retrospect, the boat rental guy should have told us that the water was too high for safe passage under the bridge.  If you hear of a bridge decapitating a boater in inland Maine, I can fathom a good guess about where it happened.\r\n\r\nBy the way, if you haven't seen the link on the home page, I posted a ton of pictures from the trip in <a href=\"\/pgHome.php\">the photo galleries<\/a>."

We stayed in a cabin in the middle of lakes, mountains, and a river, where the humidity was low, and the air smelled of pine.\r\n\r\nWe stayed with Josh and Lisa in a cabin that they own, along with Crystal, Brent, and their three kids.

After the kids went to bed, we stayed outside in the cool air drinking and laughing at all of the stories that we've already heard a million times.  We were rarely to bed before 2:00.\r\n\r\nIt was a great trip.\r\n\r\nThe nearest town was one we came to know as Redbud, as it was reminiscent of the town by that name in the move <i>Funny Farm<\/i>.  To be fair, it was more like Redbud when all of the citizens were putting on their phony \"nice\" acts than when the citizens were acting like themselves.  The only rude one I can remember was a teenage girl whose accent I could barely decipher, and who could not hide her disdain by the fat middle-aged tourists with the gall to come into her shop and ask about renting a boat for the day.\r\n\r\n<table cellpadding=\"2\" align=\"right\"><tr><td width=\"5\" rowspan=\"2\"><spacer type=\"block\" width=\"5\" height=\"1\"><\/td><td width=\"250\" ><img src=\"\/img\/MainePic2.jpg\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td class=\"caption\" width=\"250\">Paddling the Saco.<\/td><\/tr><\/table>\r\n\r\nThe police blotter in the local paper gave tell to the fact that Redbud is free of serious crime.  One report was of a missing deck chair that was later found in an outhouse.  In another report, two girls were reported missing from a local school, and were found 11 minutes later at a playground in the back of the building.  I like not only that this would be reported and written up by the local 5-0, but that the report would be given to the newspaper, and that the paper would similarly report it to all of the curious Redbud citizens.\r\n\r\nIt's tempting in the summertime to think that we should relocate to Maine.  I certainly wouldn't miss our humidity, crime, or Interstate highway traffic.  On the other hand, I don't have and don't want to have a snow shovel in my list of possessions.  On the other hand, I would also miss having the data speed provided by our 3G cell phone network, and I would miss seeing black people, Hispanics, or Asians during the course of a normal day.\r\n\r\nStay tuned for more pictures and videos to be uploaded during the upcoming days and weeks."

Netflix offers what I'm looking for, but their selection of movies that are available for streaming is frustratingly poor.  Amazon has more movies, but you have to pay per stream, and then you only have 24 hours to watch once you've started the movie.  A couple of months ago, I had to race through Casino Royale to get to the closing credits before my 24 hour deadline expired.\r\n\r\nThe technology is there to set you up with an account where you pay a monthly fee and are allowed to watch whatever you want, as much as you want.  And everyone would sign up for such a service.  I'm even willing to wait until after the DVD run and after the HBO\/Starz exclusive run to have them show up.  But after that, every movie ever made should be there.  The money the studios bank from this would certainly outweigh the fee they get from USA Network to show an edited, bleeped version.\r\n"

They prohibit food in the bar, as rats are a big problem there.  I promised not to feed the rats, but he couldn't be convinced.  We finally settled on me stashing my box in an icebox at the front bar and retrieving it on our way out.  \r\n\r\nWe spent the next two days with nonstop eating and drinking.

It took longer than it had to, as I got sucked in to a college baseball game that didnâ€™t even feature LSU, and because I had to make a late night run to Wal Mart to buy more tape.  I couldnâ€™t get my phone out fast enough to take a picture, but on my way back from Wal Mart, I passed a fully grown man, riding a full size mountain bike down College Drive, and the bike <i>had training wheels<\/i>.

There are some good ones out there, but this one was my favorite.\r\n\r\nGetting back to Sunday, I did a tweet that compared my kitchen to the rooms in Dexter, where he covers everything in plastic wrap before sawing up his victims.  I can only hope that he's quicker about it than I am.  If I were going to commit a similar murder, the person would have plenty of time to work his way out of his predicament while I hung plastic.\r\n\r\nI finally finished putting up plastic around 11:00.  Then â€“ having no furniture â€“ I sat on the hard wood floor, ate some ice cream, and pretty quickly fell asleep right there."

I can't imagine how awkward it must have been to be there, because I could barely watch it.\r\n\r\nThe radio people's consensus was that Kate is a diva, spending her time traveling, teeth whitening, and tanning, while John is the good guy, albeit a good guy who would prefer to spend more time playing golf and going to the beach.  I think this was mostly based on the beginning -- which I didn't watch, so I'll just believe it -- the same way that I believed that Barak Obama was to be sworn in on the Koran just because someone I don't know said it was so.\r\n<!--more-->\r\nI tell you what, if a network wanted to get a reality show that featured a healthy dose of cute kid stuff punctuated by parents on each others' nerves, they should find homes with three year olds who are doing major remodeling.  Not that I speak from experience or anything; I just think that might make for good TV.\r\n\r\nOne more note:  Kate now sports the \"reverse mullet\" hairstyle, which we first observed on Dewey Coulon by <a href=\"http:\/\/incoherentblog.com\" target=\"_blank\">Tyler<\/a>.  Business in back, party in the front.  Ohhh yeah."

Which is too bad.  Our friends Lisa and Josh are in town, and we had planned to goof off in New Orleans during the weekend.  We'll still do that, I'm sure, but it's a walking city, so frequent downpours aren't cool.\r\n\r\nThey showed up at our house Wednesday evening, bearing a box of the biggest lobsters that I've seen.  The biggest one had claws the size of a salad plate.  We cooked them in some crab boil, and then scooped out portions of meat the size of small steaks.  Holy crap, it was one of the best meals I've ever had.\r\n\r\nA couple hours after we had eaten, Vanya showed up crying, \"Crabs got me.\"  He had played with the live lobsters, and that lead to his first (as far as I know) nightmare.\r\n\r\nYesterday, we took my in-laws boat and took them con a tour of Acadiana wetlands.  We kayaked a little, cast for some fish (catching nothing), and drank some beer.  In all, a very good way to spend a day.\r\n"

I needed something to shade my eyes, and failing to find a cap, I found an old freebie sun visor with \"Camp Bow Wow\" written on it.

It gives all the benefits of a cap, but you don't have to take it off to scratch your head.\r\n<!--more-->\r\n(Unless you're bald -- I'll acknowledge that it won't keep the bald dudes from getting a burn.)\r\n\r\nPublic Enemy #1 for Campaign To Rescue Sun Visors From Douchebagdom (CTRSVFD) is of course, Steve Spurrier.

It would be fruitless to try to disassociate Florida fans with douchebags.  Tyler correctly points out that Gainsville is crawling with dudes in jorts and mirrored sunglasses, clapping their outstretched arms.  Trying to fight the douchebaggery there would be like trying to launch ice cubes into the sun in order to fight global warming.\r\n\r\nSo here's what I need:  I need photos of cool people in sun visors.  I googled \"Barak Obama sun visor\" and \"George Clooney sun visor\" and didn't see anything.  The pics are out there.  And there are more than just female golf and tennis professionals.  Even with \"cool sun visor,\" I came up empty.  I have an uphill battle in front of me.\r\n\r\nIf I have some time, I might start up a whole web site just dedicated to this cause."

You can post your guess in the comments, if you're so inclined.\r\n<!--more-->\r\nBack in the day, when Mrs. theskinnyonbenny was known simply as Girlfriend theskinnyonbenny, she had a roommate in the Mechanical Engineering program.  Being a female in Engineering is enough to garner a bit of attention, but she provided the horney nerds the lagniappe of being a cute non-Asian female Mechanical Engineering student.  For the sake of the abbreviation, let's just call Girlfriend theskinnyonbenny's roommate \"Kathy.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough I was in Electrical Engineering, I was friends with a handful of ME nerds, and I used to tag along to a study room in the building that housed the Engineering and Business colleges to study.  Better to do calculus in a group than in one's own stale beer-smelling room, we figured.\r\n\r\nOccasionally, one of the other students -- this one would be Monhoon -- would join us for study time.  He wasn't much of a scholar, and every time you would get a good train of thought going, he would interrupt to point out a girl passing in the hallway.  No matter what she looked like, he always made the same comment.  \"I want to fuck her nastybad!\"  This was followed by a hearty laugh that was something like a rapid fire \"HOIEEHOIEEHOIEEHOIEEE.\"  His enthusiasm for nastybad fucking was so infectious that it was difficult to get any work done.\r\n\r\nAlthough we never heard Monhoon directly refer to Kathy when he said, \"I want to fuck her nastybad,\" he certainly must have had the thought many times each day.  Monhoon may have aspired to be Don Juan, but there was  a special place in his fantasy womanizing world that was set aside just for her.  He would ask those seated between the two of them in class to ask her if she would like to share some gum.  One year, he took the opportunity of a pause in a lecture to speak across the room, inviting her to ditch Spring Break with the cool kids and road trip in a van full of kids who were mostly new to our country.\r\n\r\nIt got less cute when Monhoon moved across the street from Kathy and Girlfriend theskinnyonbenny.  And then when they got a new apartment the next school year, he moved across the street from that one.  I definitely caught him peering through the blinds a couple of times as I would come and go.  I remember reporting that he was wearing nothing but tighty-whities, but I no longer remember whether that was true or whether I just made it up.\r\n\r\nSo that's how \"I want to fuck you nastybad\" became a catchphrase that still shows up on my phone to this day.

		"post_content" : "On Saturday afternoon, faced with nothing better to do, we loaded up the Jeep and drove backroads down to Hymel's.\r\n\r\nAlthough we talk about doing it a lot, it's probably been somewhere between five and ten years since we actually made the drive down there.  It need not take the better part of an hour, but the drive is more interesting winding along the river.  It's so far down that I thought for a minute or two that I had forgotten where it was.\r\n\r\nBut soon enough, it jumped out from a bend.  A dump of a building with a sign that once stood but was split apart by years of weather.  I had forgotten that they had gas pumps out front.  Who would look at such a place and think it might be somewhere good to eat?\r\n\r\nInside hadn't changed a bit.  Being late afternoon, we were the only ones there, but every table was covered in paper, and soon enough two giant fishbowls of beer appeared.  This was soon followed by a platter of boiled crawfish and another platter of fried seafood.  And it was freaking delicious.  There's no way I'll wait years before going back.  \r\n\r\nWith a change of attitude that came on suddenly this weekend, Vanya asks to go to the potty rather than just pee in his pants.  So we got to visit Hymel's bathroom.  To be honest, I kind of wanted to check it out.\r\n\r\nI'm almost 100% sure that on a trip down there during or shortly after college, I went to the restroom at Hymel's, and the door on the single stall in the men's room hung where the bottom of the door was about five feet off the ground.  So if you walked in while someone was baking a brownie, his identity would have be protected, but you would have seen the full glory shot of crotch on bowl.\r\n\r\nThe only restroom that I found funnier was a Mexican place in uptown New Orleans whose name is long forgotten.  They had the sit-down toilet way up on a pedestal in the center of the room.  If you were to use it, your feet would be at about chest or shoulder level to everyone else in the room.  What made it hillarious is that there was no divider or curtain at all.  You would truly have been a king on his throne if you had the nerve to use that toilet.\r\n\r\nI was really proud of my kid Saturday.  On top of keeping the pee out of his pants, he put himself into the soccer game this weekend.  I can't really say that he played, but he moved at a walk behind the pack of kids who surrounded the ball.  There were times where his team wouldn't have had enough kids on the field if not for his participation.  There are almost always a couple who pull themselves out to pout or eat or for no real reason at all.\r\n\r\nThen on Saturday night, he decided to puke like a horror monster.  There was stinky sour puke all over our clothes and on his sheets.  But get this:  we're still without a washer and dryer because of our home improvements.  I'm sure I'll post more on that later, but we're a month and a half into the work, and I figure we have another month to go.  It is torture."

Sometimes her shtick is easy.  Someone will call in and ask what to do about her current cat that doesn't like the new kitten.  She says to give it time.  \"But your dogs are telling me that they're quite excited about the kitten.\"\r\n\r\nDuh.\r\n\r\nShe uses that kind of language.  \"Fido is telling me...\"  I can't figure out if I'm intrigued because the callers seem to believe this, or because I'm interested in the techniques she uses to make the bullshit fly.\r\n\r\nSometimes, she's just making things up.  A caller this week was concerned about a cat that had been missing for several days.  \"He's telling me that a dog chased him.  And that he ran a long way and got lost, but he's quite alive.\"  (She speaks with an annoying, high pitched voice with good enunciation and a British accent, if you'd like to try to get the sound of it in your head correctly.)

How do you figure he knew the color of the house?  Or the name of the material that we call stucco?\r\n\r\nHere's my idea for a radio show:  I play recorded calls that are actually questions for other radio shows.  Then, I tell them the correct answer.\r\n\r\n\"My cat Mittens has been missing for several days.\"\r\n\r\n\"He's probably horny.  Even when they're fixed, those male cats will go looking for some pussy every now and then, pardon the pun.  Just wait it out.  He'll get hungry and come home sooner or later.  Next caller.\"\r\n\r\nThen I can go to any call from any show.  Let's say I pick Dr. Laura.\r\n\r\n\"My aunt is having a baby shower for my unmarried niece.  I don't approve of her out of wedlock child rearing.  Should I go?\"\r\n\r\n\"Go to the shower.  But to make a point, kick her mother in the knew as hard as you can.  Then, deuce in the top chamber of the toilet so it refills with poo poo water every time they flush.  After that, you won't have to worry about them inviting your judgmental ass to parties in the future anyway.

So on the weekend where I feel that it's okay to ignore your whole family and watch nonstop basketball, I had no decent TV to watch the games.\r\n\r\nThe LSU\/North Carolina game was pretty good for most of the game.  And dispite my call to ignore family, I missed the part where North Carolina took over the game.  We got a call from my father-in-law that they (he and Vanya) were down at the farm, and that they had caught a fish.  I couldn't miss my son's first fish.  I jogged down to the pond, and they had a good size bass in the back of the farmer's golf cart.\r\n\r\nThey reeled in a couple more while I hung around down there too.\r\n\r\n<table style=\"align:center; margin-left:10px;\">\r\n<tr><td><img src=\"\/img\/vanya-fishcatch2.jpg\"><\/td><\/tr>\r\n<tr><td><img src=\"\/img\/vanya-fishcatch1.jpg\"><\/td><\/tr>\r\n<tr><td><img src=\"\/img\/vanya-fishcatch4.jpg\"><\/td><\/tr>\r\n<\/table>\r\n\r\nVanya was really excited to tell me about it when I got down there.  I'm glad I didn't pass it up to watch North Carolina open it up on my Tigers.\r\n\r\nOh, by the way, I didn't really have that conversation with my mother-in-law.  The whole scene did play out in my head, which made me laugh out loud, but nobody notices that the help who's unloading bags is laughing to himself."

I needed to go too, so I offered to walk over there with him.  After a short reunion with a security guard (who coincidentally watches the nearest bathrooms to where we tailgate on football game days), we moved into the men's room line.  Jim worked his way to the front of the line, and when a urinal opened up, someone pointed him toward it.\r\n\r\nHis reply:  \"No thanks.  I'll wait for a stall.  I have the pantyhose and all.\"\r\n\r\nOnly at the Spanish Town Ball would that be the most natural comment in the world.<\/td><\/tr>\r\n\r\n<tr><td><strong>Feb 15:  Mutts<\/strong><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>\r\nWe had planned to do Barkus in New Orleans this year, instead of Mutts in Baton Rouge.  It's basically the same thing, different city.  But the thought of driving home from New Orleans after an exhausting day wrangling two dogs and a three-year-old was not appealing.  So we made the last minute call to parade in Baton Rouge.\r\n\r\nThe costumes were based on a real life event, that we kept on the burner since about this time last year.  Vanya was in a doorway with the dogs on the other side.  Not thinking through the dynamic, I walked away from the scene and yelled, \"Hey Dogs!  Wanna treat?\"\r\n\r\n<table cellpadding=\"2\" align=\"right\"><tr><td width=\"5\" rowspan=\"2\"><spacer type=\"block\" width=\"5\" height=\"1\"><\/td><td width=\"250\" ><img src=\"http:\/\/theskinnyonbenny.com\/img\/gal\/052%20-%20Mardi%20Gras%202009\/resIMG_5661.JPG\" width=\"230\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td class=\"caption\" width=\"250\">The running of the bulls<\/td><\/tr><\/table>\r\n\r\nThe first dog hit the kid, knocking him face-down on the floor and continued to the kitchen in full run without even losing speed.  The second dog trapled right over the face-down toddler, also at full speed.  Mrs. theskinnyonbenny witnessed the trampling, and compared it to the running of the bulls.\r\n\r\nWe lined up for the costume contest with problems galore.  The miniature Pamplonan had fallen asleep on the way to the parade, and refused to run in front of the bulls.  In fact, he refused to walk on his own at all.  One of the bulls wouldn't keep her horns on her head, so we pulled her out of the contest at the last minute.  Then, none of them would look at the judges, which was just as well, because my last reamaining bull had knocked her horns cockeyed, and I couldn't bend down to fix them while holding the miniature Pamploanan.\r\n\r\nBy parade time, horns were on and the kid was awake, so it turned out fine.\r\n\r\nAs you walk, you hear people comment on your costumes.  It turns out that Baton Rougans are much more familiar with The Devil than they are with bovines.<\/td><\/tr>\r\n\r\n<tr><td><strong>Feb 19:  Muses<\/strong><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>\r\n\r\nThursday before Mardi Gras, I left work early, picked up the kid, and headed to New Orleans for the parades.  Mrs. theskinnyonbenny is a member of the Krewe of Muses, and Thursday is their night to parade.  Even without her participation, Muses would be my <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nola.com\/mardigras\/index.ssf\/2009\/02\/nola_readers_choose_muses_as_u.html\" target=\"_blank\">favorite parade<\/a>.  The floats, attractions, and throws are as good or better than the big famous ones over the weekend, and the crowds are lighter.  The result is a fun parade where the throws just rain down.  \r\n\r\nWe got to the parade route early, and didn't have to wait too long before the first parade (not Muses, and I don't know which one it was) started.  There was a fat guy by the street, standing in front of us, and he had on a set of fake platic boobs, with a hoodie zipped over it.  He would often unzip to flash his plastic.\r\n\r\n\"What's that Papa?\" the little voice chirped.\r\n\r\n\"Oh nothing.  That's just boobies.\"\r\n\r\n\"Boooobeeeees?\"\r\n\r\n<table cellpadding=\"2\" align=\"right\"><tr><td width=\"5\" rowspan=\"2\"><spacer type=\"block\" width=\"5\" height=\"1\"><\/td><td width=\"250\" ><img src=\"http:\/\/theskinnyonbenny.com\/img\/gal\/052%20-%20Mardi%20Gras%202009\/resIMG_5701_from_stacie.jpg\" width=\"230\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td class=\"caption\" width=\"250\">This is the only picture I have from Muses, since I was holding Vanya the whole parade.  Thanks to Stacie for sending me this one.<\/td><\/tr><\/table>\r\n\r\nThe man zipped back up, and we watched some more parade.  The cold wind picked up a bit.  A different old man turned and asked Vanya, \"Are you cold?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.  There's boobies over there,\" he answered, pointing at the man.\r\n\r\nAnd later, out of the blue, \"Papa, I like boobies.\"\r\n\r\nIt makes a father proud.\r\n\r\nMuses didn't get downtown until quite late, and Mrs. theskinnyonbenny was on the very last float.  Jim (the butt pirate from above) had watched the parade uptown, and he arrived downtown in time to see the whole thing again.  It turns out that he had been running along next to the wrong float yelling Mrs. theskinnyonbenny's name up at the strangers in masks, so he needed the opportunity to get good stuff while he was down.  \r\n\r\nVanya fell asleep in my arms right at the beginning of the parade.  But almost at the end, one of the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.rollingelvi.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">rolling Elvi<\/a> rolled up, patted him on the back, and then offered him a lollypop.  The candy was enough to break the sleep, and he caught the last few floats, and may or may not have believed that the masked rider in the last float was his mother.<\/td><\/tr>\r\n\r\n<tr><td><strong>Feb 21:  Tucks<\/strong><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>\r\nAfter a detour for an afternoon sail on Friday, we went back into New Orleans on Saturday, intending to catch Iris and Tucks.  We walked down with our friends Dave and Suzanne who live just a couple of blocks off of the parade route.  \r\n\r\n<table cellpadding=\"2\" align=\"right\"><tr><td width=\"5\" rowspan=\"2\"><spacer type=\"block\" width=\"5\" height=\"1\"><\/td><td width=\"250\" ><img src=\"http:\/\/theskinnyonbenny.com\/img\/gal\/052%20-%20Mardi%20Gras%202009\/resIMG_5753.JPG\" width=\"230\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td class=\"caption\" width=\"250\">River of horse piss.<\/td><\/tr><\/table>\r\n\r\nWe missed all but the very last float of Iris, denying us our annual opportunity to be ignored by old women.\r\n\r\nTucks was fun.  Good parade.  The parade paused with a group of horses next to us, and since there was nothing better to do, a couple of the riders brought their mounts to the side of the road so the kids could pet them on the nose.  They stood around over there for a while, when a horse in front of us turned on a garden hose of urine, which ran in a river right back into the crowd.\r\n\r\nThe pee had an earthy, grassy smell, and kids and old ladies scurried to move their bags and coolers out of the stream.\r\n\r\nSuzanne complained about the smell, so I told her, \"It just smells like Kentucky to me.\"\r\n\r\n(Kentucky is her home state, but I couldn't find a way to work that fact gracefully into the story.)<\/td><\/tr>\r\n\r\n<tr><td><strong>Feb 24:  Beauregard Town<\/strong><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>\r\n\r\n<table cellpadding=\"2\" align=\"right\"><tr><td width=\"5\" rowspan=\"2\"><spacer type=\"block\" width=\"5\" height=\"1\"><\/td><td width=\"250\" ><img src=\"http:\/\/theskinnyonbenny.com\/img\/gal\/052%20-%20Mardi%20Gras%202009\/resIMG_5788.JPG\" width=\"230\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td class=\"caption\" width=\"250\">A robot joined the bull for the BT parade this year.<\/td><\/tr><\/table>\r\n\r\nFor some reason, there is no actual parade in Baton Rouge on Fat Tuesday.

It's where we have our business office, and where Mrs. theskinnyonbenny works every day, but I would love to live down there too.\r\n\r\nThe parade is more of a party with props, that moves up and down through the streets in a big blob of peple.  There's constant music, and only a small handful of spectators, all of whom are cajoled into joining the parade spontaneously.\r\n\r\nYou will have to check the pictures in order to do justice to the event.<\/td><\/tr><\/table>\r\n\r\n<a onclick=\"window.open('\/pg3.php?spgmGal=052%20-%20Mardi%20Gras%202009','052MardiGras2009','width=1024, height=768, toolbar=no, location = no, directories=no, menubar=no, resizable=yes, scrollbars=no');\">Here's the photo gallery with all of the pictures that I have<\/a>.

I thought that would be fine; on the way back, we would be approaching toward her face, and I thought I could pull it off then.\r\n\r\nBut coming back, she was on the phone, and looking away from the aisle.

On top of that, I don't ever remember needing all of the ear-shaving I get now.  On the up side, he did tell me as I was leaving, \"You have very nice hair.\"\r\n\r\nSo that's good to hear.\r\n<!--more-->\r\nIn case you were wondering, Pookie was this guy in college (who truly went by that name, although I suspect that's not the name on his birth certificate) who had an inordinately hairy neck.  In my mind's eye, Pookie is still collecting ever LSU sporting event on VHS tape, and he's nervously counting down the days until there is no existing technology to play his collection.\r\n\r\nPookie's opposite in hairiness was Paul, who was severely balding even during our youthful prime, and who spent countless wasted hours lamenting his virginity.  And then he also claimed never to have masturbated, so perhaps it built up some sort of immense internal pressure which forced the hair right out of its follicles.  \r\n\r\nI know a lot of weird people.\r\n\r\nWhile I'm thinking about it, there was another weirdo -- Ned -- who haven't thought about more than a few times since he upped and left town to globetrot with his employer, the U. S. Army.  He showed up in a dream a couple of weeks ago, and in that dream, he had spent the whole fifteen years since I've seen him as some sort of food flavor inventor.  He had developed all of the different flavors that we used to get in our fraternity house.  He had them packaged as little cups of foam, kind of like whipped cream.\r\n\r\nI started my tasting with the \"Chris Noel's cologne\" flavor.  It was a little like Red Bull.\r\n\r\nThen, I tried Mama Dee's corn dogs.  They were as bad as ever, but they did capture the authentic flavor of horse meat surrounded by packed stale cornbread that I used to detest with my entire heart and soul.\r\n\r\nI was trying to prove that he didn't really invent <i>every<\/i> flavor from the house, so I asked to try the cockroach.  He asked whether I wanted the adult or juvenile flavor.  Cockroach, apparently, has subtle characteristics.  Not unlike a fine wine.\r\n\r\nI don't remember trying the cockroach in my dream, but I don't think the flavor could really be appreciated.  His cups of foam left you without all the crispy bits of exoskeleton that you get when you eat a real cockroach.  Or so I presume.  I ate a grasshopper in Thailand, and it was extremely bitter tasting.  The worst part was the little chips floating around between the lips and gums.  I couldn't get rid of those damned things for a half hour or so.\r\n\r\nAfter that, I asked to try the flavor of my own farts after a night of drinking cheap beer in college bars.  He had a foam with that flavor, and it was so strong in my dream, that it made me jump up, awake.\r\n\r\nI suppose a lot of weird people consider me one of their own weird acquaintances."

But yes, of course I endorse that behavior.\r\n\r\nI guess I'll start with this \"kissing it up to god.\"  I'm not aware of this means of sterilization, but it sounds like, well... a godsend.  Can someone share the ritual with me?  It seems like something I should know.\r\n\r\nWhen I was a kid, and we would visit our cousins, they would drop off the whole pack of a dozen or so of us at the movies.  This was back when movie theater floors were full of trash and sticky with spilled coke all of the time.  On one trip, my cousin Michael purposefully tripped a stranger, causing him to spill his popcorn.  Michael was willing to eat the spilled popcorn off the floor, allowing him to pocket his own popcorn money.  I didn't go as far as to eat the popcorn off the nasty floor, but don't think that I wasn't filled with admiration.  Because I certainly was.\r\n\r\nThe day after I got this post from Shelly, I was in an all-day meeting.  At 11:30, we were released for lunch, but asked to reassemble at noon.  That made the only option the cafeteria on the first floor of our building.  I'm about as sick of their food as it's possible to be, but I headed down hoping that they had fish sandwiches that day.\r\n\r\nTheir fish sandwiches are pretty good, a little like McDonald's fillet of fish.  The fish has a very light batter, and the inside has a soft, almost buttery texture.  The bun is pretty good too.  Sometimes they have chicken instead, which is okay, but not nearly as good as the fish.\r\n\r\n<table cellpadding=\"2\" align=\"right\"><tr><td width=\"5\" rowspan=\"2\"><spacer type=\"block\" width=\"5\" height=\"1\"><\/td><td width=\"250\" ><img src=\"\/img\/icfchair.jpg\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td class=\"caption\" width=\"250\">I don't know if you can really tell how nasty the arm of this chair is.  It should be salmon-colored, but it's gray, with a salmon tint.  I split most of my work time between a dirty office and a clean one, and this is my chair in the dirty office.<\/td><\/tr><\/table>\r\n\r\nWell, they did have my fish on Tuesday.  I picked up my sandwich, got a side of black-eyed peas (their selections in the soul-food food group is decent, if you add some salt and season it up a little bit), loaded my sandwich with tomato, pickles, and condiments, and went back up to my desk.  I hadn't checked news or sports headlines yet, and I had 15 minutes to eat and scan them simultaneously.\r\n\r\nI was eating, web surfing, and talking to the guy across the aisle when a significant chunk of my fish jumped out of the sandwich and fell on the floor.  My first reaction was to cry, but I took a couple of deep breaths, and I was able to choke back the tears.  Since the guy I was talking to could see me, I picked it up off the floor, and put it to the side, as if I was going to wad it up and throw it out with my wrapper.\r\n\r\nBut you see where this is going.\r\n\r\nI cut the conversation short, and finished my sandwich.  One more look to make sure no one was watching me, and the fish from the floor was in my mouth and down my gullet. Mmmmmmmmmmm.  Then I quickly wadded up the wrapper where the fish had been sitting, no one the wiser that the wrapper was now empty.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis really isn't that gross.  This happened in a state building that is very new and at least seems very clean.  Yes, the fish was under the desk.  And come to think of it, I had a smidge of dog poop on my shoe one day this week.  I can't remember if it was the same day or not.  And it's true that the prisoners who clean the building only vacuum once every couple of weeks (I guess because they're here in the middle of the day, and the vacuum cleaner would be annoying if they ran it all of the time).  But still, it seems very clean.\r\n\r\nThe other office where I regularly work is far from clean.  Everything there is gross.  Like late-70s movie theater floor gross.  My chair is gross, as you can see.  And I don't even like the soles of my shoes to walk on that nasty floor.  I think the floor is probably about as gross as the floor of a New York City bus.  I really need to learn this \"kissing it up to god\" ritual.\r\n\r\n"

But all of that happens outside, and it's going to be butt cold this weekend.  So I don't really know what I'll do, cooped up inside with a talkative Tasmanian Devil all weekend."

And it's funny because it's true.\r\n\r\nSomehow, fate dealt my endlessly garrulous sister a quiet, calm little kid, and dealt my comparatively quiet family one who won't stop running his mouth.  A couple of days ago, I was outside his room when he woke up in the morning, and rather than getting out of bed or yelling for one of us, he started his chatter.  I caught some names of people, the phrase \"go play trains\" and a bunch of stuff that I don't remember.<\/td><\/tr><\/table>\r\n<!--more-->\r\n<table cellpadding= \"10\" cellspacing=\"0\"><tr><td rowspan=\"8\" valign=\"top\" cellpadding=\"0\">This carries right on through the day, and keeps going once he's put to bed at night.  I went upstairs to get my keys after he had been in bed for a half hour.  My arrival at the top of the stairs coincided with a triumphant, \"I DID IT!\" from his room.  Presumably, he had completed the puzzle that he insisted on taking to bed.\r\n\r\nThe holiday weekends were fun this year.  On Christmas Eve, I smoked a turkey, a duck, a seperate turkey breast, two extra turkey legs, a bunch of andouillie sausage, and three large pork tenderloins.  I also made a pumpkin pie, some pumpkin bread, and the cornbread for dressing.  I also made a big pot of seafood gumbo.  All of this was done by 2:00 that afternoon.\r\n\r\nSo then we spent the next week eating.  The turkey, duck, and sausage got used in a new gumbo on New Year's Eve, but there's still a little food left.  A ziplock bag of green bean casserole mysteriously appeared in my sink yesterday.  I'm almost certain that it was from my leftovers, but I'm not sure where it had been hiding or how it got to the sink more than a week later.\r\n\r\nMy favorite present was a fly rod (along with a reel and some line).  I've never done any fly fishing before, and I'm most excited to learn it.  There seems to be a pretty active community in Baton Rouge, so I'll start getting involved.  It's only a matter of time until you read the story of how I hooked the back of someone's head, or wrapped by line around a stump housing a family of water moccasins.  That's how it goes when I learn a new hobby.\r\n\r\nSo, how were all of your Christmases?  And for my Jewish friends, how was the movie and the Chinese food?\r\n\r\nOh yeah, there was a little bit of football being played too, wasn't there?  It's amazing how a good old fashioned whipping in the bowl game can make a fan feel okay about the team again.  I'm already all optimistic about next season.  Through my rosy glasses, the QB problem is solved, and we're getting a new defensive coaching staff as a late Christmas present this week.  To top it off, the best high school players in the country seem to all have LSU on their list.  We're going nowhere for a while.\r\n\r\nOne thing you can say about Les Miles LSU teams is that they show up to play for their bowl games.  It may be the one area where our fans can universally agree that he outshines St. Saban.  Especially after this year's Sugar Bowl.  I think some of the Bama players may have snuck out after bed check.  This definitely isn't the same Alabama team that beat Arkansas and Georgia.  They peaked somewhere around mid season, and they were lucky enough to stay undefeated through the rest of the schedule.\r\n\r\nI can't decide whether I'm doing the Gator chomp or singing Sooner Boomer Thursday night.  I'm leaning toward the Sooners right now.  Their fans were okay when they were down to play us for the first national championship after the 03 season.  And I'd also like the Tigers to remain the only 2-time BCS champs.

I remember paiting the molding in my den and getting so hot that I dropped my clothes and kept painting buck naked.

Mrs. theskinnyonbenny would sit in her chair and continue to watch TV nonplussed, but I still would have had a toddler pointing at me and shouting, \"NAAAKID PAPA!\"  Who needs that?\r\n\r\nThe other reason is that I was right in front of the window.  There's a coating on that window that blocks out a lot of the afternoon sun.  That's nice, but at night, it's just a huge black mirror.  And if you've ever taken a leak in a bathroom where the lady of the house put a mirror over the commode (no man would do that), you know how unpleasant it is to be stuck in one place, looking at your own ding dong."

I ordered the steak.\r\n\r\nWe had no family obligations, there was no snow on the ground in Colorado, and the forecast scared us away from a sailing voyage.

They had pates, breads, and cheeses too, but why fill up on those when you can opt for smoked fish and crab claws?\r\n\r\nI followed that up with a turtle soup, which is definitely one of my favorite soups, and I think theirs is the best I've had.  It was chock full of reptile meat, and the stock had plenty of seasoning, onion, and sherry.  (I do like it better when I get to pour my own sherry into the soup, though).\r\n\r\nMrs. Theskinnyonbenny and the kid followed up with turkey and dressing plates, but I went for a filet mignon covered in crab meat.   Ohhh so good.  Then there was another table with a bunch of different kinds of cakes.\r\n\r\nWe had planned to go from there and catch a couple of horse races, but were too full and tired, so we just went home.\r\n\r\nI've had some god-awful Thanksgivings, but some really, really good ones too.  Here are my three favorites.\r\n\r\n<ul><li><b>1993 (I think)<\/b>:  My first trip to Las Vegas.  My first intensive weekend of sports gambling.  My first Thanksgiving that mixed feasting and binge drinking.  It blew my young, impressionable mind.<\/li>\r\n\r\n<li><b>1995<\/b>:  The future Mrs. theskinnyonbenny and I were to get married the Saturday after Thanksgiving.  We had both spent Wednesday night separately in the French Quarter.  Me, bar hopping with my bachelor party crew, and she watching the swinging dicks with the bachelorettes.  We crossed the River Thursday afternoon, and went to my Aunt Maryâ€™s for dinner.  Crystal and Brent went with us, and the four of us got set up at a kidâ€™s table outside of the normal dining room.  \r\n\r\nCrystal, Brent, and I chowed down and then slept on the floor in front of a football game.  The future Mrs. theskinnyonbenny found that seeing food made her want to puke, and then spent nap time listening to my family tell stories.  (She thinkâ€™s itâ€™s rude to sleep on other peoplesâ€™ floors during the middle of the day.  I remember a particular Super Bowl party and a different Thanksgiving where she got mad at me for this behavior.) \r\n\r\nThat night, back in Baton Rouge, we ate more Thanksgiving food at the only place we could find open -- a nasty buffet connected to one of the riverboat casinos in town.  I don't know why this was funny, but it was.<\/li>\r\n\r\n<li><b>2005<\/b>:  Colorado trip for our 10th wedding anniversary.  First time in a zillion years I had been in a good, heavy snow.  Drank bottle after bottle of wine out by the bonfire, swapping stories with strangers.  This is how every Thanksgiving should be spent.   \r\nI would like to take this opportunity to invite any and all of you readers to go to Colorado with us for Thanksgiving next year.  Your only obligation should you accept this invite is to stay in the room and watch my kid while Mrs. theskinnyonbenny and I try to drink them out of wine by the bonfire.  That, and pay for your own trip, in case there was any question about that aspect of the invitation).<\/li><\/ul>\r\n"

It's yet another competition for the fans to watch and root for.  But the experts also always say something like, \"You have to wait four years to really see what this class is all about.\"\r\n\r\nBut I don't know of anyone that looks four years in the past to see how the rankings really should have gone.  I did a little poking around, and from what I see, the experts don't know dick.\r\n<!--more-->\r\nLet's look at the rankings for <a href=\"http:\/\/recruiting.scout.com\/a.z?s=73&p=9&c=14&yr=2005\" target=\"_blank\">2005<\/a>.  We've got Tennessee ranked first, Michigan second, and Florida State third.  Those class members are juniors or seniors now, and those teams' combined record is poo poo.  LSU is ranked 19th on that list, mostly on the strength of 5-star recruit Ryan Perriloux, who will see more snaps for his penitentiary intramural squad than he ever did as a Tiger QB.\r\n\r\nIf my memory is correct, Heisman favorite Colt McCoy decided to go to Texas over LSU when Perriloux changed his commitment from Texas to LSU.  That makes me sick to my stomach. \r\n\r\nThe other Heisman favorite is Sam Bradford of Oklahoma, who led an offense that could score at will against the 2nd ranked team in the country this past weekend.  He was a three-star recruit, by the way.  And he's just a sophomore.\r\n\r\nLSU's freshman QB was a four star recruit.  Let's take a gander at some stats.\r\n\r\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"4px\"><tr><td>Player<\/td><td>cmp<\/td><td>att<\/td><td>yds<\/td><td>td<\/td><td>int<\/td><td>rat<\/td><\/tr>\r\n<tr><td>Jarrett Lee, LSU<\/td><td>143<\/td><td>269<\/td><td>1873<\/td><td>14<\/td><td>16<\/td><td>116.93<\/td><\/tr>\r\n<tr><td>Colt McCoy<\/td><td>217<\/td><td>318<\/td><td>2570<\/td><td>29<\/td><td>7<\/td><td>161.82<\/td><\/tr>\r\n<tr><td>Sam Bradford, Oklahoma<\/td><td>238<\/td><td>341<\/td><td>3121<\/td><td>36<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>176.52<\/td><\/tr><\/table>\r\n\r\nOn the glass-half-full side, it's unlikely now that LSU will be selected for the Cotton Bowl, where they would lose by 30 or more to the third place team from the Big 12.  Give me a Peach Bowl against a name brand but not that great ACC team any day."

For probably two years, the battery has been dead, and it's stuck on 5:15.  But that doesn't stop me from looking up there to check the time.  I probably check the time on that clock four times a week.\r\n\r\nSometimes, my brain shouts \"5:15!\" as my head is still swiveling toward the clock.  Sometimes -- especially if I'm groggy -- I still have to look at the clock and wonder, \"What time is it?  Shit, I would swear that it was just 7:30.  I don't under...  Ohhhhh, yeah.\"\r\n\r\n<center><img src=\"\/img\/greenline.gif\"><\/center>\r\n\r\nVanya talks in full sentences all of the time now, but he sometimes gets his word order wrong.  Like last week, when he wanted help reaching something, and he called his Mama for help.  I was in the kitchen (close to where he was), so I offered to get it.  He pointed back to the stove and told me, \"Not you Papa!  Go back to supper cooking!\"  Must have been hungry.\r\n\r\nThe funnier directive was a day or two later in the bathroom with the 5:15.  He pointed at the toilet and said, \"Sit down Papa.  Read paper!\"\r\n\r\n<center><img src=\"\/img\/greenline.gif\"><\/center>\r\n\r\nYou know that bit on Dave Chapelle's show where he was a blind guy, but also a racist because being blind, he didn't know he was black?\r\n\r\nI think Blossom might have something similar going on.  I think she doesn't like dogs, and she's so stupid, she doesn't realize that she <i>is<\/i> a dog.  Mrs. theskinnyonbenny took the dogs to the dog park, and she wouldn't get out of the car.  She just sat and waited while Lily sniffed around the park.\r\n\r\nAnd when we encounter dogs on our walk.  Lily wants to sniff butts, but she finds a way to stay several dog lengths away from all of that butt-sniffing.  Even with her neck on a leash and her butt four feet from her head.  It's quite a talent, it is.\r\n"

But for this week and next, youâ€™ll just have to settle for what I can puke out, a minute here and a minute there.\r\n\r\nThis past weekend, we went on a little excursion to New York.  We ate pretty good, drank in some cool bars, walked up and down the Avenues people watching and shopping.  Monday evening, we met several other people at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.flatironlounge.com\" target=\"_blank\">Flatiron Lounge<\/a>.\r\n<!--more-->\r\nFlatiron is the bar of a famous bartender.  Perhaps you didn't know that there are famous bartenders, but Mrs. theskinnyonbenny can find another extreme coctail-phile and drop names back and forth like you and I might be able to do with N.F.L. quarterbacks.  It's an odd celebrity group to know, but on the upside, I go to big cities, take a cab across town, and pour exotic drinks in my mouth that taste like the gods' elixers and pack a most pleasant punch.\r\n\r\nAnyway, their snack mix included some kind of nut that had been smoked.  So toward the end of our stay, I said with much enthusiasm, \"I should smoke me some nuts.  That would be gooood.\"\r\n\r\nAnd then, realizing what I said, I laughed at myself for a half hour straight.\r\n\r\nLater, we were waiting for Madonna to start her show at Madison Square Garden, Shelly borrowed my cell phone, and texted everyone we know in common the message, \"Will you smoke my nuts?\"\r\n\r\nA sampling of replies...\r\n\r\nTyler:  Sure, if you get me a new job.\r\n\r\nSharples:  If you get me drunk first, you betcha!\r\n\r\nCraig:  I'm not sure if that's supposed to go to me?\r\n\r\nClay didn't respond, so Shelly sent one more to him:  Shelly's titties are looking really hot and juicy tonight....\r\n\r\nSounds more like a roast beef po-boy than how I would describe titties, but maybe she was hungry.\r\n\r\nAnyway, if you got a wierd text from me on Monday night, that's what was going on.\r\n\r\nThe show was really good.  It was half-circus, half-concert.  I've described Madonna in concert before, so there's no reason to go back through it. \r\n\r\nIn looking for other good reasons to make fun of me, I had one of the most boneheaded gambling episodes in history this weekend.  We do this pool where you have to pick one college football underdog to win outright every weekend.  If your pick does pull the upset, you get the number of points by which the other team was favored.  I've been doing this for a few years, and for the first time in the history of the pool, someone (I) picked a favorite.  As if all of a sudden I don't even understand the game we're playing.\r\n\r\nIt bought me no points, but I was the only one to pick a correct winner last weekend.\r\n\r\nI took <a onclick=\"window.open('\/pg3.php?spgmGal=048%20-%20New%20York%20October%202008','048NewYorkOctober2008','width=1024, height=768, toolbar=no, location = no, directories=no, menubar=no, resizable=yes, scrollbars=no');\"  >a few pics<\/a> up there for you to check out too, and I had an <a href=\"overheardinnewyork.com\" target=\"_blank\">Overheard in New York<\/a> moment too, which I'll leave for another day."

If you are easily disgusted or offended, please move along to another wep page now.\r\n\r\nWhen we last visited, I was elated to finally be able to move back to my newly air-conditioned house.  All is getting back to normal now -- the yard is clear of debris, and repairs have been made to the minor damage that we had.  Our cable line is still lying on the ground, which means I haven't had television or high-speed internet at home since labor day (16 days now), but we're managing to get by.\r\n\r\nNow I have to rewind, going back to our Florida trip.  We went out there for a wedding in <a href=\"http:\/\/theskinnyonbenny.com\/x\/shellynjIndex.php\">Shelly's<\/a> family.  During the course of events, I found out that Shelly's mother checks my site every day.  So this post is for her.\r\n<!--more-->\r\n<div style=\"margin-left: 5em\">Dear Suzanne,\r\n\r\nYour daughter is one of my favorite people and closest friends, but you should know that a more crude person has never set foot on the planet.  And perhaps this is why I like her so much.\r\n\r\nOne night, we were up late drinking, and Shelly came up with a question for the group.  Mind you, this was all females, plus your boy here.\r\n\r\n\"If you had a gun to your head, and you had to choose, would you eat your own poop, the person on your left's poop, or the person on your right's poop?\"\r\n\r\nTo Shelly and me, the answer was obvious.  Our own poop, of course.  As disgusting as it would be, it wouldn't be nearly as bad as eating someone else's.\r\n\r\nYour niece\/cousin\/whatever -- the beautiful bride (I'm hesitant to use any more real names.  Once I click \"post,\" this stuff is out there forever.) -- picked her sister-in-law's poop.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if Shelly was more mortified, or if the Sister-in-was.  SIL was thrust innocently into the conversation through no will of her own, and Shelly quickly pointed out that maybe she takes it in the back door, or maybe she swallows, but there was a good chance that Bride would be eating her own brother's sperm.\r\n\r\nAnd let me tell you that I've cleaned up the language in that exchange A LOT.\r\n\r\nI don't know how, but SIL indicated that the back-door thing wasn't happening without saying it bluntly, but the other option was still out there.\r\n\r\nBut Megan -- damn, I've used the Bride's name -- held fast.  She claims that even with the presence of her own brother's digested sperm, her in-law's poop was still a better selection than her own trifiling, stinky messes.\r\n\r\nBut please don't think you've failed as a mother.  Now that I've met the whole family, you didn't stand a chance.\r\n\r\nHugs and kisses,\r\n\r\nbenny\r\n<\/div>\r\n\r\n<center><img src=\"\/img\/greenline.gif\"><\/center>\r\n\r\nDisgusting things notwithstanding it was a good trip.  As soon as I get a reliable connection, I'll post some pictures.\r\n\r\nOn our way back into Baton Rouge, a week after Gustov, I turned down a main street trying to get home, and a large tree still blocked my passage.\r\n\r\n\"Shit.\"  I said this under my breath.\r\n\r\n\"Shit,\" chirped the two-year-old voice from the back seat.\r\n\r\n\"No, no, no.  Don't say that.  Papa shouldn't have said that.  Don't ever say that word any more.\"\r\n\r\nAnd being fussed at, Vanya started wailing.  And I had to find my way home through the tree maze with my distraught kid shrieking because I fussed at him for repeating me."

I like the song, and the lyrics describe my mood right now perfectly.  Well, maybe the lyrics have a little more anger in them than I do, but I feel that powerful.\r\n\r\nI can split the atoms of a molecule.\r\n\r\n(Not a single atom.  But ones tied to a molecule?  No prob.)\r\n<!--more-->\r\nIâ€™m feeling so good, because I just went to check on our house, and thereâ€™s a crew from Illinois working to reconnect our electricity.\r\n\r\nIf youâ€™re reading this from outside of Louisiana, you might just think that Hurricane Gustov rolled up to our coast, and then fizzled into nothing.  But here we are, ten days later, and the conversation started in Baton Rouge is still, â€œSo, do you guys have power yet?â€�   Weâ€™ve barely talked Tigers or Saints.  Instead, we discuss curfews, road closures, near-riots in food stamp lines.\r\n\r\nGood times.\r\n\r\nWe came back from Florida Sunday.  Stayed in Slidell (with electricity) Sunday night, and then took three hours (normally an hour and a half) to get into town Monday morning.  \r\n\r\nMonday evening, our office got electricity, so Mrs, theskinnyonbenny, Vanya, me, and two dogs have been sleeping on an air mattress on the floor over there.  Itâ€™s not the worst way to get through a week, but I wonâ€™t be leading a gypsy lifestyle any time soon.\r\n\r\nNext hurricane, letâ€™s do this:  everyone I know without power puts in $10.  Last one to have it restored gets the pot.  For this storm, weâ€™d  be talking about $400 or so.  That would make it a little more bearable.  Every day, youâ€™re either happy to get your power back, or youâ€™re happy that one other contestant is eliminated from the mix."

There's been much debate about whether it was worse in Baton Rouge than Andrew or Rita (which the consensus holds as the worst so far), and I'm going to go with Gustav over those.  In fairness, I was passed out drunk through the meat of Andrew (it was in college), but if it were all that serious, something would have woken me up.\r\n<!--more-->\r\nOn Tuesday, there wasn't a spot in the city that had electricity, and many of the lines and poles were taken down by trees.  In the part of town where I live, it was hard to find your way through because trees blocked every road.  I only heard of a couple of freak deaths, and I didn't see any homes destroyed, but nothing is open yet where people could get food or ice or anything like that.  \r\n\r\nWe were planning to leave town on Wednesday anyway, so we just packed up and headed out a day early.  I'm comfortable at a hotel on the beach in Florida, with a million other Louisiana residents.  Everywhere I turn, there's someone like me wearing LSU gear, walking their dogs.  When I walked my two idots this morning, I checked the plates in the lot.  I looked at about 40 plates, and only one was not Louisiana.  So we're all here for the same reason.\r\n\r\nBy the way, there's one other guy downstairs working on his laptop.  I'm a nerd, yes.  But at least I'm at a window overlooking the ocean in a t-shirt and swim suit.  He actually got up and dressed in <i>business casual<\/i> to come sit in the lobby and work.  He has a fine view of the front desk, and when I walked by, he was telling someone at his office, \"I don't even think we lost power there.  I would rather be there than here.\"  Some people.\r\n\r\nLast night, we checked in, walked the dogs, got a drink, and headed to the beach.  It was the first time for Vanya, and I haven't ever observed a kid's first time to see the ocean.  He walked down the steps toward the sand very slowly.  I was at the bottom, waiting patiently.\r\n\r\nOn the second to last step, he pointed down and said, \"What's that?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's sand.\"  Has the kid never even played in a sandbox?  Maybe not.  I can't think of a time.\r\n\r\nHe got to the bottom step and brushed a toe over the top of the sand.  He looked down at my feet to see if I was sinking.  \"Come on!\" I encouraged him.\r\n\r\nHe put one foot down.  Then the other.  Then, he shot both arms up in the air -- the universal toddler sign for \"Pick me up.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, just walk, you'll get used to it.\"\r\n\r\nHe looked like he was laboring as he walked toward the surf, but he did get the hang of it in a minute or two.\r\n\r\nWe walked on the hard wet sand for a long time before a wave came up and got his ankles.  He was all smiles.  \"Wader cold!\"\r\n\r\nFrom then on, when a wave would come up, he would run uphill laughing to the dry sand so the water wouldn't get him.  \r\n\r\nWith all that's going on, I've taken no pictures of damage or the vacation, but I'll pick up on my photography today.  I did post <a href=\"onclick=\"window.open('\/pg3.php?spgmGal=046%20-%20Puppies%20and%20Play%20at%20Farm','046PuppiesandPlayatFarm','width=1024, height=768, toolbar=no, location = no, directories=no, menubar=no, resizable=yes, scrollbars=no');\">this set of photos<\/a> from a couple of weeks ago earlier in the week, but I haven't let you know that it's out there yet.\r\n\r\nBen\r\n"

You know the magical device that youâ€™ve dreamed of?  The one where you can hit a button and the light changes to green for you?  Well, it was just like I had one of those in reverse.\r\n\r\nOnce I sat through the first 5 reds, I got downtown, where there is a light at every block.  I got stopped block after block after block.  Three times, I tried to change my luck by turning to a different street, and all three times I saw a yellow signal at the end of the block in front of me.\r\n<!--more-->\r\nThen I got to the parking garage.  The parking garage can be a significant part of my daily commute home.  The first day I left downtown, it took me 20 minutes to wind my way down and out to the street, followed by a less than 10 minute drive home.  Iâ€™m thinking about walking out to the garage every day around 3:30, and move my car down the slope to get a spot vacated by an early arriver\/early leaver.  Would that be worse for my car than the 20 minutes of idling?\r\n\r\nThere are parking lots downtown too, and if I parked there, I could just roll in and out without the line, but those cost money, and the garage parking is paid for by the state.  I canâ€™t justify going out of pocket to get in and out in a hurry.\r\n\r\nIâ€™m working amidst a bunch of FEMA employees on loan to the state.  If you think your average office has a bunch of secretaries who spend all of their time refreshing hurricane eye path forecasts and freaking out, you havenâ€™t seen the half of it.  As I type, Hurricane Gustav is on its way, and thereâ€™s another named storm behind it.  I understand that the H storm, whose name I forget, is looking more toward Floridaâ€™s East coast.\r\n\r\nFEMA is taking Gustav pretty seriously.  Theyâ€™re keeping their employees home tomorrow, even though the storm isnâ€™t set to hit until late Monday.  Contract workers like me have been told that thereâ€™s a good chance that we will be told to stay home and out of the way next week.  That would be all right, I think.\r\n\r\nI guess that Iâ€™ll have to pull <i>Velvet Elvis<\/i> out of the water unless the forecast track changes quite suddenly by the end of the day tomorrow.  Iâ€™m a bit worried that this whole thing might interfere with me spending all day Saturday watching college football.  Iâ€™m afraid that if I wait until Sunday, there will be mile-long lines for the boat ramps, and Iâ€™ll have to sit in a ton of traffic to get back to Baton Rouge.  What a mess.\r\n"

That's an example of marketing dollars badly spent, and I'll tell you why.\r\n\r\nFirst and foremost, 85% of the people in the world will forget all about Phelps as soon as they blow out the Olympic flame at the end of the closing ceremonies Sunday.  The last 15% will forget him altogether four days later, as the king of all sports (college football) kicks off once again.\r\n<!--more-->\r\nThat leaves a statistically insignificant number of swimming nerds who might remember Michael Phelps and care what he endorses, and those people have paid enough attention to see that he comes across as a dick.  Not only that, but if you stick around for one of his interviews, you realize that he's possibly as stupid as a career gas station attendant.  He speaks in grunts and all marble-mouthed, and if you're lucky enough to fail to understand his words, you're sparing yourself a large amount of inane blather.\r\n\r\nIf I were spending millions on someone to shill my product, that person better have Magic Johnson charisma.  Shawn Johnson had that Magic smile and held herself together well in an interview with Bob Costas in prime time.  I think I'd throw my money that way, if I thought I needed an Olympian.\r\n\r\nAs you might have guessed by my lack of posts, I'm glued to the TV these weeks.  I haven't watched this much Olympics if you combined all of the time I spent watching the Atlanta, Sydney, and Athens games.  There are several reasons for this.  First, this is my first high-def Olympics.  That makes a big difference.  Second, if NBC is showing some cheesy interest feature, one of the other channels in the NBC family is showing an actual event.  This leads to my third enticement -- some really cool events that I've never seen.\r\n\r\nA couple posts back, I made fun of trampoline as an event.  I was picturing a barefoot 12-year-old in her back yardwho happened to be good at flips and things.  I take all that back.  What those people were doing was absolutely sick.  Take a look online if you didn't catch it on the tube.  \r\n\r\nThe sprints were even more amazing.  I know that LSU football had an off day yesterday, and I can only hope that Coach Miles was on the first morning flight to Jamaica, in search of the next 6'4\" monster who can run a 40 in under 4 seconds.  \r\n\r\nBy the way, as I'm typing this, I just saw a Cuban win a short hurdle race wearing glasses.  I've never seen a sprinter wear glasses before, and despite being the best hurdle sprinter in the world at this very moment, and despite being fast as a racehorse, and despite having zero fat and decent muscles, he still looks like a big old nerd in those glasses.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I've been up until at least 11:00 or 12:00 every night, and sometimes even later.  Then, I'm up at 5:00 most mornings, as I've been juggling two jobs.  That's not interesting to you, but it's kept me busy enough to keep from reading internet spoilers during the day, which makes the events that much more exciting at night.  It's an evil circle, destined to lead to a fiery car crash after I fall asleep at the wheel this weekend.\r\n\r\nI have more to say on the college football front, but I think I\"m going to log off so that I can watch the men's beach volleyball final with my full attention.  But here are a couple of links that you might enjoy, particularly if you share some of my rooting interests in the King of Sports.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/msn.foxsports.com\/cfb\/story\/8450384\/Report:-USC-dealing-with-jock-itch-outbreak\" target=\"_blank\">Jock itch outbreak at USC<\/a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/collegefootball.rivals.com\/content.asp?CID=837024\" target=\"_blank\">Would a win over Florida at their field be bittersweet if all of their team was injured?<\/a>  Not at all.  I'd like to see Tebow bump his head and slip into an unexplainable coma this weekend to top it all off.\r\n\r\nFriday morning update:  I fell asleep after one set of the volleyball.  Anyone know who won?"

Watch; I'll illustrate....\r\n<!--more-->\r\n<div style=\"margin-left:3em;\">Vanya finally named one of his stuffed animals.  A floppy-eared dog, who he calls Foo Foo.\r\n\r\nThis morning, as I got him out of bed, he decided not to bring the toy down with us.  Once we were downstairs, I asked him why Foo Foo didn't want to come with us.\r\n\r\n\"Foo Foo sleepy.\"\r\n<\/div>\r\n\r\nI can't go on, lest I be overwhelmed by the urge to rip out my own fingernails, but it's amazing how many blogs read like this.\r\n\r\n<center><img src=\"\/img\/greenline.gif\"><\/center>\r\n\r\nThe heat during the early part of this week was unreal.  You're smart enough to go look up the numbers for yourself, but I can tell you that just stepping out the door on Monday afternoon felt like getting into a black car parked in the sun on any other summer day.  We haven't been getting our <a href=\"http:\/\/theskinnyonbenny.com\/blog2\/archives\/127\">normal summer afternoon downpours<\/a>, and I guess they make a difference.\r\n\r\nI walked the dogs at 8:30 Monday night, and my ankles could still feel the heat radiating from the street.  How hot was that for the dogs, whose bare feet walk the road, and whose entire undersides are just a foot off of the heat source?  Still, Lily seemed to enjoy her walk, as always, and Blossom seemed to drag behind, as always.\r\n\r\nI played tennis on Wednesday night, and even though we lost, it was the most fun match I've played.  I was all over the court, getting to shots that I couldn't have even whiffed at six weeks ago.  It was mixed doubles, and the man on the other court hadn't lost a match yet.  Let me tell you, without just a couple of critical errors, he would have lost his first this week.\r\n\r\nMost painful was a point where we were up 6-5 in the first set tiebreaker.  I was at the net, and the ball came right to me.  I knocked a dink straight down that they had no chance to get to, and for a millisecond it was point and set to us.  But then right after I hit the ball, my racquet hit the top of the net.  Point to them.  They ended up winning the tiebreaker 9-7.\r\n\r\nWe won the second set 7-5, and then handily lost a 10-point tiebreaker to see who won the overall match.  I noticed during that tiebreaker that the other matches had finished, and we had probably 12-15 people watching and cheering, mostly cheering for the bad guys.\r\n\r\nI was completely drenched with sweat at the end.  Even my hat was without a single dry spot on it.\r\n\r\nAfterwards, one of the pros who works at that park invited me to come hit with a bunch of guys ranked much more highly than me a couple times a week.  I mention this for two reasons.  First, I am clearly a bad-ass now.  \r\n\r\nSecond, <a href=\"http:\/\/theskinnyonbenny.com\/dailyphoto\/2008\/page.php?year=2008&month=06&day=14\">Stacie<\/a> had a raging hard-on for the guy a couple of years ago.  Or whatever the female equivalent of a raging hard-on is.\r\n\r\nStace, let me know if I can pass him a note from you."

I stumbled onto this video promoting the season that starts this August, and it's clear that this particular video is targeted at the parents more than at the kids.\r\n\r\nI'm not very good at identifying a celebrity, and I couldn't place all of these, but we obviously have Feist, whose hit plays in the video, and whose lyrics are updated to be a fun song about learning to count.  Tina Fey is in as a Lemon, and a text graphic makes sure we get the joke (that her character on <i>30 Rock<\/i> is named Liz Lemon).\r\n\r\nMost excitingly -- and I had to rewind to make sure this was true -- we have Will Arnett on as a magician.  If they would promise me that he would make a bunch of pennies appear and fall all over that table he's standing by, tinkling as they fall down onto Sesame Street, I would be a huge fan.  I would DVR that episode and watch it more than once.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->\r\nOf course, they would have to tell me when that episode is on too.  Even though I have a two year old in the house, I don't know when <i>Sesame Street<\/i> airs.  He knows the name \"Elmo,\" but not \"Big Bird,\" and I don't know if he's ever seen a real episode or just knows that from books, toys, and classmates.  The program just isn't on our radar at all.\r\n\r\nAnd I guess that's why they're targeting me with their promo video.\r\n\r\n<object width=\"425\" height=\"344\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/v\/ArPWoqdB42Q&hl=en&fs=1\"><\/param><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"transparent\"><\/param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"><\/param><embed src=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/v\/ArPWoqdB42Q&hl=en&fs=1\" type=\"application\/x-shockwave-flash\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" wmode=\"transparent\" width=\"425\" height=\"344\"><\/embed><\/object>\r\n\r\nEven if you aren't a fan of <i>30 Rock<\/i> or <i>Arrested Development<\/i>, there are bound to be some pop-culture tie-ins or celebrity cameos that amuse you.

Say John Stewart is interviewing a guest about a book he wrote.  You hit a button on the remote, and a box from Amazon shows up with your book a few days later.\r\n\r\nThis is a cool feature, and I'll be glad to have it, but to be honest, I won't ever buy something this way.\r\n<!--more-->\r\nIf I were a Tivo executive, I would be working with a major hotel change on a hotel room version of Tivo.  Guests would be able to log into web sites, enter their confirmation number, and record shows that would then be available on special Tivo boxes in their rooms.  Guests would also be able to pull programming down from their home Tivo boxes and watch it in their rooms.\r\n\r\nIf one major hotel chain had this feature, the guests would flock there.  Maybe not in Manhattan or San Francisco or New Orleans, but there are millions of business travelers in boring-ass rooms in boring-ass cities right now who would pay a premium for this feature.\r\n\r\nI would also be POURING money into a project to integrate Slingbox into Tivo boxes.  Then, travelers with internet anywhere can watch their own TV on their laptops.  You don't think I would have cut off my pinkie for such a luxury <a href=\"http:\/\/theskinnyonbenny.com\/adop\/page.php?fn=adj05172007.content\" target=\"_blank\">last year in Yaroslavl<\/a>?\r\n\r\nWhile I'm pointing out improvements needed by Tivo, their web site could really use an update.  They have the same stale lists of what celebrities are recording, and the same tired show recommendations that they've always had up.  They need me to read TV columnists all week, and then give recommended viewing links to shows people really might enjoy.  Especially when it comes to finding new shows.\r\n\r\nBecause I'm a television.lover, I read columns written by TV writers.  I checked them out Saturday morning while my wife and kid were taking a nap.  They were all reviewing <a href=\"http:\/\/drhorrible.com\" target=\"_blank\">Dr. Horrible's Sing Along Blog<\/a>, and it was unanimously favorable.\r\n\r\nI went to the site, and watched the three 15-minute episodes back to back to back.  It's a production from Joss Whedon (Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Firefly) which chronicals an evil inventor's attempt to attract the attention of a do-gooder, battle his musclehead superhero nemesis, and get accepted into the Evil Leage of Evil.  And there's singing.  Lots of singing.\r\n\r\nThe lines (both spoken and sung) are quotable and fantastic.  I went and watched the whole show again Sunday night.\r\n\r\nI went to post a link Monday morning, and the episodes were down.  Instead, there's a link where you can buy them for $6.00 from Itunes.  Six dollars seems like a bit much for a 45-minute show, but I'm sure there are pirate copies out there by now.  If you can find them, they're worth a watch.  I think it might even be funnier the second time.\r\n\r\nThere are three \"suspension of disbelief\" shows that I'm eagerly anticipating next TV year.  Whedon's <i><a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=yDcEKo4V7fA\" target=\"_blank\">Dollhouse<\/a><\/i> and J. J. Abram's (<i>Lost<\/i>, <i>Twin Peaks<\/i>) <a href=\"http:\/\/youtube.com\/watch?v=ZAu4L5_Fl84\" target=\"_blank\"><i>Fringe<\/i><\/a> get me excited based entirely on the producers' pedigree.  I'm also hopeful about the Americanized <i><a href=\"http:\/\/youtube.com\/watch?v=TYxGm1T2Ve4\" target=\"_blank\"><i>Life On Mars<\/i><\/a>.  I saw the first two or three versions of the British series, and it intrigued me.  Unfortunately, I'm not a big watcher of BBC America, and never caught it again.\r\n\r\nI suppose I could have Tivo'd it."

		"post_content" : "The middle of summer is a time that most real sports fans dread.  Your choices are between golf (good for a nap, if nothing else), NASCAR (as boring as golf, but much noisier), and baseball (whose games make the national spelling bee look like a meaningful competition).\r\n\r\nIn honor of this season of boring, I've been reading stories on <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nbcolympics.com\" target=\"_blank\">www.nbcolympics.com<\/a>.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\r\nNever in our history has man been pelted with non-meaningful sport as we are about to be.  NBC owns so much of your cable spectrum, and each and every channel must be broadcasting events.  Even Oxygen is shelving women's programming for events.\r\n\r\nNBC is shelling out so much money for the games, that they have the Olympic Committee scheduling the top-shelf events in America's prime time.  Do you happen to already be in Asia?  Prepare for sprint and gymnastics finals over breakfast.  In Europe?  It's going to be an awfully late night for you to see the finals starting at midnight.\r\n\r\nAs always, there are some events that need to be shelved.  Everyone knows about synchronized swimming.  Thythmic gymnastics is right there too -- the performers dance around with ribbons and props.  It's like a judged cirque de soliel, although I bet it's not as imaginative.\r\n\r\n<table cellpadding=\"2\" align=\"right\"><tr><td width=\"250\" ><img src=\"\/img\/olympictramp.jpg\"><\/td><td width=\"5\" rowspan=\"2\"><spacer type=\"block\" width=\"5\" height=\"1\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td class=\"caption\" width=\"250\">Olympic-caliber trampolining.<\/td><\/tr><\/table>\r\n\r\nI didn't know until last week that \"Trampoline,\" is now an honest to goodness Olympic event.  That's obviously a candidate for being dumped.  I'm going to try to find it on one of the broadcasts to see what it's like.  If it's a third-grader bouncing up and down, throwing in the occasional flip, I'll call for its immediate dismissal.  But you have to see it to know.  Face it, you thought Table Tennis was a silly game too, until you went to see <i>Forest Gump<\/i> and saw how well it could be played.\r\n\r\nSince I'm killing sports, I'm also willing to add them back in.  I'll pass on car racing, but I'll throw a bone to the events where you can drink and participate:  golf and bowling.  Golf is by far the most popular spectator sport that isn't already included, and if you're going to add one sport where a couple of beers can improve your game, then go ahead and add them both.  That's my school of thought.\r\n\r\nAfter that, I would concentrate on events that combine different sports.  First, I would add an adventure race.  Get from point A to point B as fast as you can, however you can.  But between points A and B, there would be rivers, lakes, volcanos, tar pits, or whatever might make it interesting.\r\n\r\n<table cellpadding=\"2\" align=\"right\"><tr><td width=\"250\" ><img src=\"\/img\/olympicrhythm.jpg\"><\/td><td width=\"5\" rowspan=\"2\"><spacer type=\"block\" width=\"5\" height=\"1\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td class=\"caption\" width=\"250\">Rhythmic Gymnastics has got to go.  Keep it as a comp show in Vegas for the families of the high rollers.<\/td><\/tr><\/table>\r\n\r\nThen, I would have a combined canoe, rowing, and sailing event, called the boatathalon.  Or maybe, we can throw in a swim and some diving, and call it the aquathalon.\r\n\r\nFinally, we would have an event called Olympic Grab Bag.  The event would span several days.  Each morning, a judge would pull the name of an individual Olympic event out of a hat.  That afternoon, the entrants would compete.  After that, the event and the event's close relatives are pulled out of the mix. You don't want to see them run a 200 m dash one day, just to turn around and run the 400 the next day.\r\n\r\nI'm thinking this goes on for six to eight days.  Or maybe we just go ahead and do an event every day of the games.  Think how well rounded the athletes would have to be:  they would need to be strong enough to throw the shot put or do weightlifting, but then quick enough for sprints on the track, bicycle, or in the pool.  They would have to be able to operate any number of boats, ride a horse, use the gymnastics equipment,  handle racquets for tennis, badminton, or ping pong, handle the various swords, guns, and bows used in fencing, shooting, and archery, pole vault, dive, and everything else that you see people do.  This might be so hard that no one could actually compete.  But wouldn't it be fun to see someone try?\r\n\r\nLest you think this is just nonsense, read from Wikipedia about the modern pentathalon -- an underrated Olympic event that has been part of the games since its modern inception.\r\n\r\n<table cellpadding=\"2\" align=\"right\"><tr><td width=\"250\" ><img src=\"\/img\/olympicsail.jpg\"><\/td><td width=\"5\" rowspan=\"2\"><spacer type=\"block\" width=\"5\" height=\"1\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td class=\"caption\" width=\"250\">Leg 2 of the future boatathalon.<\/td><\/tr><\/table>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>The modern pentathlon was invented by the Baron Pierre de Coubertin, the founder of the modern Olympic Games. As the events of the ancient pentathlon were modeled after the skills of the ideal soldier of that time, Coubertin created the contest to simulate the experience of a 19th century cavalry soldier behind enemy lines: he must ride an unfamiliar horse, fight with pistol and sword, swim, and run.<\/blockquote>\r\n\r\nYes, they ride horses (I didn't realize that it had to be an unfamiliar horse), shoot pistols, run a cross country race, swim, and sword fight.  That's so obscure, I bet I could start training now, and be nationally ranked by next go 'round."

In case you're wondering, my top five is rounded out by the DVR, air conditioning, and the wheel.\r\n<!--more-->\r\nOne night while I was walking the dogs, I decided that I was going to add a music podcast to my site.  I figured out the songs that I was going to feature in the first episode.  I planned to regulary feature a cover that was better than the original, and find a nominee for \"worst song of all time hall of fame\" each time.  It would have been good, I assure you.\r\n\r\nBut then I started looking into copyrights and distribution laws, and it's a mess.  Even if I was going to limit what I play to a 30-second snippit, and even if I was going to be talking over 10 seconds of that, it was completely disallowed.  Buying rights wasn't feasible, and fines for just doing it anyway are more than I'm willing to gamble.\r\n\r\nThe last couple of months, I've been playing with this primitive yet useful site, <a href=\"http:\/\/muxtape.com\" target=\"_blank\">muxtape.com<\/a>.  I've found a ton of music that I like a lot, but more importantly, it gives me a spot to share what I'm listening to with anyone who's interested.  For several weeks, I've been thinking, \"Surely it will be shut down any minute now,\" yet it persists.\r\n\r\nMy taste in music is all over the map, but there are some seasonal trends.  In the rainy cold winter, I trend toward thinking man's, folksy college rock.  In the spring, it shifts to punk and hard rock.  Summer shifts me in more of a pop direction -- although I'm not switching to the top 40 radio stations or anything like that, and when football season starts, I'm back to sort of an alt-rock baseline.\r\n\r\nMy go-tos this summer are currently <a href=\"http:\/\/bens4lsu.muxtape.com\" target=\"_blank\">on muxtape<\/a> for your pleasure.  The only one that's in heavy rotation that isn't posted is \"Let's Dance to Joy Division\" by The Wombats.  This was the free tune of the week on Itunes a few weeks back, and I can honestly say that it's the only one of the free downloads that I've ever seen that was worth a shit at all.  But because my free copy still came tied up with Itunes DRM, I can't post it for the world to hear.\r\n\r\n<b>The Rapture -- No Sex for Ben<\/b>  How funny is that song title?  I heard this one afternoon on satellite, and looked it up.  It was from the GTA4 soundtrack.  Video game soundtrack leads me straight to my nephew, who is a video game nerd, who of course, already had this soundtrack and was familiar with the song.  Viola, it's in my playlist.\r\n\r\n<b>Black Kids - I'm Not Gonna Teach Your Boyfriend How To Dance With You<\/b>  A catchy gem that gets in your head and is hard to get out.  I would like it better without the synthesizer, but it's my most played this year.\r\n\r\n<b>O.A.R. - That Was a Crazy Game of Poker<\/b>  This was a band that apparently everyone knew but me.  A long song, but a good one.\r\n\r\n<b>Rachid Taha - Rock el Casbah<\/b>  Imagine having this in your party mix.  It comes on while everyone sips their Fourth of July Pisco Sours, and it sounds familiar, but no one can place it.  You see them wonder why a song in a language they can't even identify -- much less understand -- sounds familiar, until we get to the hook, when we all realize it's a new version of an all time classic.  Good times.  By the way, if anyone can identify the language for me, I would appreciate it.\r\n\r\n<b>Los Campesinos! - You! Me! Dancing!<\/b>  I don't know where I first heard this.  It takes 1:15 to get going, but then it's another keeper.  This is a good one to turn up loud when you're dancing at home by yourself.  If you include the Wombats song that I didn't upload, I'm listing three songs with some form of the word \"Dancing\" in the title.  That will never happen again.\r\n\r\n<b>Coldplay - Viva La Vida<\/b>  Yes, you heard it on the Itunes commercial during every single break of every single show in May and June.  Still, it's a keeper.  Chuck Klosterman wrote that Coldplay was Travis for people who aren't smart enough to get Travis, and that Travis was Radiohead for people who weren't smart enough to get Radiohead.  So I'm a dummy.\r\n\r\n<b>Salt-N-Pepa - Let's Talk About Sex<\/b> I downloaded this a month or two ago after a debate over whether or not Salt-N-Pepa was the original artist.  I bet you haven't listened to this since 1992.  Listen again, it's even better now.\r\n"

No one would actually buy that many (and I question why one would even carry that many, but perhaps they'll come in handy if he has to bribe a hijacker or something).\r\n\r\nI wonder how I can get a sponsor that will allow me to just up and travel for a year or two.

I initially thought it was spam; there are a lot of spammers who drop comments on a blog post with some generic comment that could apply to anything you might write, but then with a link to a page where you can order erectile dysfunction drugs.\r\n\r\nThis email's author had done a little homework.  He had specific comments on a couple of recent posts, and he was very complimentary.  Then, he asked for some favorable feedback on a survey.  I took a looksee, and it turns out that his cause is one that deserves my attention.\r\n<!--more-->\r\nIt seems that our local <s>newspaper<\/s> pet cage liner is running <a href=\"http:\/\/www.2theadvocate.com\/comicsurvey\" target=\"_blank\">a survey<\/a> to see which comic strips they should run and which ones they shouldn't.  My correspondent is the author of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.deflocked.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Deflocked<\/a>, which looks to be one of several newer strips seeking to replace the tired, old, crappy comics that we're subjected to each weekday.\r\n\r\n<table cellpadding=\"2\" align=\"center\">\r\n<tr>\r\n<td width=\"250\" ><img src=\"\/img\/deflocked.jpg\"><\/td>\r\n<td width=\"5\" rowspan=\"2\"><spacer type=\"block\" width=\"5\" height=\"1\"><\/td>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td class=\"caption\" width=\"250\">Here are a few drawings from the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.deflocked.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">deflocked web site<\/a> that I liked.<\/td>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n<\/table>\r\n\r\nLet's look at some of the worst of the comics that The Advocate is considering keeping:\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<strong>B. C.<\/strong> -- If it weren't for bad puns, this strip would run day after day with no discernable joke at all.\r\n\r\n<strong>Cathy<\/strong> -- Perhaps the absolute worst comic strip of all time.  The theme of the comic:  Cathy feels ugly.  And who would blame her?  I would slice off my own penis with a butter knife before I spent the night with the real-world equivalent of that troll.  What a waste of paper and ink.\r\n\r\n<strong>Curtis<\/strong> -- What's worse than featuring a not-funny comic strip just to get some ethnic diversity on your page?  How about featuring a not-funny comic strip that perpetuates negative stereotypes of a minority?  I'm betting that anyone with an ounce of creativity can set a comic strip in an inner city without featuring barber shop gags.\r\n\r\n<strong>For Better or Worse<\/strong> -- Even worse than bad puns, neurotic women, and non-funny African Americans is a comic that intentionally tries to be NOT funny.  We can get our cute turn or sappy smile by turning the page to Ann Landers.  Leave the comic strips to comedy (bad or not).\r\n\r\n<strong>Garfield<\/strong> -- Remember when Garfield was a new comic, and people went ape-shit about how funny it was?  \"The cat eats <i>lasagna<\/i> HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!\"  Well, absolutely nothing new has happened since.  For 20 years, we've been reading, looking for that original bit that must show up sooner or later.  To say that Jim Davis is mailing it in is to point out a waste of postal resources.\r\n\r\n<strong>Hagar the Horrible<\/strong> -- Here's the gag:  he's a Viking who loots castles, but treats that looting like a normal 9 to 5 job.  And his wife still rules the roost.  Not much, for sure.  You would have to have a lot of nerve to run that same gag day after day for thirty years, wouldn't you?  Well, someone has just that much nerve.\r\n\r\n<strong>Mallard Filmore<\/strong> -- Because there might be a man, woman, or child who longs to be told what to think by conservatives, but who might have missed the 23 out of every 24 hours that Sean Hannity or Rush Limbaugh seem to be preaching on radio and TV, there is this cartoon duck to fill the void.  Honestly, if he wasn't so preachy, it might funny, but if the political conservatives won't even shut the fuck up on the comics page, where can I get some relief?\r\n\r\n<strong>The Wizard of Id<\/strong> -- I'm tired and bored of writing about how tired and boring these comic strips are.  This is just another one that hasn't had a creative idea in my adult lifetime.<\/ul>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n(By the way, old comic strips don't necessarily mean bad ones.  Blondie still delivers from time to time.  Blondie is the anti-Cathy:  confident and sexy, owns her own business, is not an overbearing wife, but one who can prod her husband to take up the (very) occasional weekend chore.  Likewise, the Peanuts reruns that run every day are really good.  Sure, you should be able to pick really good comics from a library of 50-years of strips, but they stayed good throughout the run, I think.)\r\n\r\nKnowing my fellow Advocate-subscriber is likely to be a semi-conscious septuagenarian, I don't hold out much hope for change, but please, please, please, go to the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.2theadvocate.com\/comicsurvey\" target=\"_blank\">Advocate's poll<\/a>, and fill your list with the comics that you've not yet had a chance to read.  If you do this, and if they listen, I guarantee that the updated comics page will be an improvement."

So I spent a couple of hours Sunday evening throwing out spoiled food, eyeballing the \"sort of cool\" items for mold, and wiping up the red juice that flows out of warm ground beef, followed by hauling the refrigerator to the curb.\r\n<!--more-->\r\nMonday morning, I walked out the front door at about 7:45.  My driveway was completely blocked by a pickup truck parked across its width, while its driver struggled to shove the broken refrigerator up into its bed.  I walked up, offering a hand with the thought that it would get me out of there a couple minutes sooner.  \r\n\r\nThe guy introduced himself with a statement of the obvious.  \"I'm just an old black man, having trouble getting this up in there.\"\r\n\r\nHe was clearly a professional salvager, decked out in a hard hat and work gloves.  His size (roughly that of a brick shit house, another old geezer saying that isn't on that web page) suggests that he wasn't always incapable of lifting a refrigerator.  I bet that he could have carried the thing on his back 20 years ago.  But on top of the weight of the refrigerator, he was struggling with limited truck bed space, due to the rusted out barbecue pit and flimsy metal shelving that he had also picked up.\r\n \r\nI've been wondering why he felt the need to highlight his age and race, and why we trivialized the statement with the \"just\" in \"I'm just an old black man.\"  Irrational as it is, I'm guessing that there are a lot of people who get angry with other people taking their trash, and the old geezer has learned a way to defuse that initial reaction.\r\n\r\nAlthough it amuses me to think of a more unlikely scenario:\r\n\r\n<div style=\"padding-left:4em\">\"Honey, get the shotgun!  There are a bunch of frat boys stealing our broken refrigerator!\"\r\n\r\n\"Wait....  Never mind.  It's just an old black man.  No harm done.\"<\/div>\r\n\r\nAnyway, I told him he was welcome to it, and bent over to help him lift his prize into the truck.  The handle from the rusted barbecue put up a formidable block, and then, the fridge hit the wheel hump.  We then pivoted the refrigerator upright, and the old man found a way to fit a huge metal pipe in the bed too.\r\n\r\nI was covered in all of the dirt stuck to the bottom of a 13-year-old refrigerator in a pet-filled kitchen, so I went in for a washcloth wipe-down.  When I came out, the truck was still there, but I got in my driver's seat and waited.\r\n\r\nAnd waited.\r\n\r\nAnd waited.\r\n\r\nI finally got out and walked back to the truck.  His battery was dead, and he was asking the passing vehicles for jumper cables.\r\n\r\nI didn't have any cables either, so I asked if we could push his truck out of my driveway.  He was agreeable, and so after that one additional chore, I was able to go to work.\r\n\r\nI noticed the time as I left the driveway.  8:20."

I had the top down on the Jeep, and his window was down, so he stuck a fully extended arm way out of his window, and started giving me the finger.\r\n\r\nHe held the gesture in place as I pulled into the street, and then, as our cars were as close as they would pass, he yelled, \"YOU SUCK!\"\r\n<!--more-->\r\nFour or five minutes later, I answered the phone, and he told me that Vanya's teacher was outside the door to witness the whole thing.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if this is coincidental, but they decided to move Vanya up to the next class, which puts him in a different building than Sharple's baby.\r\n\r\n<center><img src=\"\/img\/greenline.gif\"><\/center>\r\n\r\n\"Have you looked at the schedule on the usta web site?\"\r\n\r\n\"Web site?

Not things like the picture of me wearing Cathy Michaels' panties back from college, I hope.\"\r\n\r\n<center><img src=\"\/img\/greenline.gif\"><\/center>\r\n\r\nIn other embarassment-meets swimwear news, there's this from Saturday:\r\n\r\nMrs. theskinnyonbenny took the toddler for a paddle in the kayaks.  She reluctantly wore a life jacket -- at my strong suggesting -- in case the kid rocked the boat to the point where it was upside down.  I've never actually witnessed anyone accidentally tump a kayak in placid, protected water, but it happens.\r\n\r\nThey were having fun, so after a short while, I grabbed the second kayak and rushed out to join them.  We splashed through the water for a little while longer, and then Mrs. theskinnyonbenny returned to dock to end her trip.\r\n\r\nOne of my parents lifted Vanya out of her lap, and then she tried to rise.  The boat got wobbly, so she lowered herself, adjusted her leg position, and tried again.\r\n\r\n\"Hang on.  Stand up like this,\" I instructed.  I then I started to demonstrate the proper way to get from a kayak to a deck that's higher than you are.\r\n\r\nExcept that 2 seconds into my demonstration, my kayak went quickly and completely upside down.  With barely enough warning to take a breath, I found myself under water, the upside-down boat floating carelessly above my head.\r\n\r\nI popped out of the water, and Vanay was pointing at my bobbing head, saying, \"uh-ohhhh.\"  He repeated it several times to make sure someone noticed that I had gone from boating to swimming.\r\n\r\nA neighbor heard the commotion and walked over to see who was wet too.  But at least it wasn't too public of a setting."

I watched the fourth quarter, in which the Hornets closed a 15-point gap down to three, and then missed a couple of three-pointers that would have tied it with under a minute to play.  \r\n\r\nAfter that, I found myself awake and restless.  I pattered around the house for a while, and when I finally went back to the bedroom, Blossom (the 55 pound Bassett hound) was lying next to a live mouse.  They were both awake but calm, sitting together like they had been friends for years.\r\n<!--more-->\r\nI knew we had a rodent in the kitchen, as one of cats -- Nigel II -- had been spending his nights staring at the stove waiting for a chance to attack.

Probably the latter. \r\n\r\nI considered going to get a camera to take a picture of Blossom and her friend, but I didn't want to return and find the mouse under the covers or anything, so I passed on the pic.\r\n\r\nI don't know where it came from, but we have one of those things that first offense DWI convicts use to pick up trash on the side of the highway without breaking their backs.  You squeeze a handle, and the end closes up to grab whatever it surrounds.\r\n\r\nI got that, and tried to close it over the mouse.  He squirmed out, but I guess he was too stunned or too hurt to try to make a real run for it.  I grabbed again, this time for the shoulders.  I had a good hold on him, but I spoke out loud to the mouse, explaining that his only hope of getting out of this whole thing alive was to be still and let me take him outside.  I don't really care about his little rodent life, but I didn't step out of bed and plant a foot into a dead gutted mouse first thing in the morning either.\r\n\r\nI carried the little guy to the front door and flung him in the bushes."

Also, I was asleep for a couple of hours in there, so I really didn't come close to the 8 straight hours of racing that it seems like I did.\r\n\r\nThe name of this year's derby winner has allowed me to formulate a joke that I've already used three times.  Just substitute the phrase, \"a Kentucky Derby Champion\" when you want to reference poop.  For example, \"Can you wait ten minutes before we go?  I need to make a Kentucky Derby Champion.\"  Or, \"Do you have a Kentucky Derby Champion in your diaper?\"  If I were energetic enough, I would change the title on my home page to \"theskinnyonbenny:  making a Kentucky Derby Champion at 9:30 every morning.\"\r\n\r\nOn a more serious note, I want to ponder the fate of Eight Belles.  Here was a filly (female horse, three years old or less.  Older female horses are mares.) who was supposed to run in the Kentucky Oaks the prior Friday.  This is the premier stakes race for fillies.  It's rare for them to compete in the Derby, which is open to horses of both sexes.\r\n\r\nAnyway, Eight Belles showed such promise that she was scratched from the Oaks so that she could run in the Derby.  She ran a great race, finished second, and then broke both of her front legs in her cool-down.  They euthanized her where she fell, after arranging two equine and one human ambulance around her so that the spectators would be spared the sight of it all.\r\n\r\nOne part of my mind knew what was happening when I saw the ambulances were pulling into position.  But it was overridden by the thought of, \"They're going to subject this horse to a painful improbable recovery like Barbaro.  They should probably go ahead and put her down.\"\r\n\r\nThey did the right thing, but it was shocking nevertheless.  NBC went to the track for an update, and it was already done.  They showed one shot of the horse falling, and got the camera out of there.\r\n\r\nI can't imagine the swing from high to low as, MY HORSE JUST WON THE KENTUCKY DERBY, to MY HORSE IS DEAD, as the owners of Eight Belles must have experienced.  ESPN's Stuart Scott talked about watching the race with a young daughter, who was pulling for Eight Belles, as the only filly in the field.  I would hate to have to explain that.  It was too quick to change channels, so you would have gone from high-fiving the kid to consoling her and explaining about death.  That would be horrible.\r\n\r\nGetting back to Big Brown, he looked more than a little impressive.  He was four or five wide going around every turn, and through most of the race, Kent Desormeaux seemed to be holding him back.  When he turned the horse loose, he blew past everyone and looked to have more in the tank. \r\n\r\nThe Preakness is his to lose.  The only question mark is that Big Brown will be running on two-week's rest, which is nothing for a horse.  Most of the other Preakness entries will have not run in the Derby, so they'll be primed to go.  It's a shorter race than the other two, and a Big Brown win will have the world buzzing about a triple crown.\r\n\r\nThe Belmont is just two more weeks away, and it's a whopping mile and a half.  These horses run forever, and to win a triple crown, they have to do it as their third week in a month and a half.  It's a grueling task, and I'm starting to suspect that the horses that are fast enough don't have the stamina to win all three.  We may not see another triple crown winner in our lifetimes.  Fathom that.\r\n"

He drew out the \"or,\" so it sounded like, \"morrrrrrrrre?\"\r\n\r\nMiss Pat sat him on a stool and put his rice and beans in front of him.\r\n\r\nVanya was happy.\r\n\r\nWhile he ate, Miss Pat took out her own salad.  She was hungry for supper as well.\r\n\r\nVanya thought a bite of salad might taste good too.  So he asked for some.  \"Morrrrrrrrre?\"\r\n\r\nBut Miss Pat didn't want to share.  \"No, Vanya.  This is <u>my<\/u> salad.  You eat your beans.\"\r\n\r\nBut Vanya was sure that she just misunderstood.  Surely, no one would deny a cute little Russian a simple bite of lettuce.\r\n\r\n\"Morrrrrrre?\"\r\n\r\n\"No Vanya.  Eat your beans.\"\r\n\r\nThis discussion progressed, until Vanya realized that he couldn't have any salad.\r\n\r\nVanya was sad.\r\n\r\nEventually, Mama and Papa returned, and Vanya knew that he would again be allowed to eat vegetables when he became hungry.\r\n\r\n<center>THE END<\/center>"

The Big Ten and Pac 10 still refuse to hold conference championship games, and still hold tight to their automatic Rose Bowl berth, as if it were still 1949.  \r\n\r\nI say, start a championship series without them.  Let the winners of the SEC, Big 12, Big East, and ACC championship games be seeded 1-4 and have them play off in the non-Rose BCS bowls.  It's just that easy.  USC and the Ohio St.\/Michigan winner can crow about being \"true champions,\" but all of the voters and everyone else will know that the true champions are the team that won 3 postseason games rather than one.  Eventually, they'll bag the Rose Bowl, hold conference championship games, and join the rest of us in the present.\r\n\r\n\r\n<center><img src=\"\/img\/greenline.gif\" \/><\/center>\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Hornets have been fun to watch in the playoffs.  I had a post started back in November or December about how basketball fans better go watch them now.  The barely-populated stadium portended a hasty exit for the NBA in New Orleans, and the fans would need to take their opportunity to see the best point guard in the league now.\r\n\r\nAt the time, they were running ridiculous specials for groups of tickets.  You could even get a suite for you and all of your friends right before game time for something like $60\/person.\r\n\r\nBut, with the end of football, people have woken up to how good the team is.  And the national media has started to notice a little bit.  If we can pull the series win against the Spurs, New Orleans will have proven to be set as a league powerhouse for the next five years, at least.\r\n\r\n\r\n<center><img src=\"\/img\/greenline.gif\" \/><\/center>\r\n\r\n\r\nExxon reported a 17% growth in profit to $10.9 billion for the first quarter.  Can you imagine that much money?\r\n\r\nThey better start giving away cash to employees and charities before the government comes knocking.  Hillary has already mentioned a corporate \"excessive earnings tax,\" which has big-oil giveaway written all over it.\r\n\r\nI don't think it would hurt Exxon investors a bit if they would take a billion of that profit next quarter and fund a program to provide health care for those without insurance.  It would also help ensure the government stays out of their coffer, and do a little good in the process.  That's my advice.\r\n\r\n\r\n<center><img src=\"\/img\/greenline.gif\" \/><\/center>\r\n\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2008\/05\/01\/us\/01license.html?scp=1&sq=arizona+plates&st=nyt\" target=\"_blank\">Arizona ran out of license plate numbers.<\/a>  I don't know why, but I thought that was interesting.\r\n\r\n\r\n<center><img src=\"\/img\/greenline.gif\" \/><\/center>\r\n\r\n<center><img src=\"\/img\/starbucks.jpg\" \/><\/center>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStarbucks rolled out a new logo recently.

Sigh.\r\n\r\nAnyway, our friend Dave had some slow cooked pork that had roasted over a barely warm fire for six hours, and came out on a plate falling to pieces.\r\n\r\nI decided to try to replicate that pork, and shortly after noon on Sunday, I had a good fire built in the smoker, and I added a large pork shoulder to the smoke box.\r\n\r\nI went on with my day, doing this and that, and occasionally returning to the smoker to add wood and stoke my fire.  At 5:00, a girl came over to start a barter arrangement.  I was going to put together a three page web site for her, and she was to provide some free babysitting, so we can eat and drink like we're accustomed to doing.\r\n\r\nIt was a nice evening, so we sat down outside, poured a drink, and I started up the laptop.  While waiting for it to boot, I turned back and stoked my fire a bit.  I hurried it a little, because the small talk wasn't coming that easily, and when I took my first step back to the bar, I planted the arch of my bare foot firmly onto a red-hot ember that had escaped the fire box without my notice.\r\n\r\nI was as cool as it's possible to be in such a situation.  I uttered a mild curse, took a couple of hops, and sat down at the computer.  It didn't pass unnoticed, but no one got up to see if I was okay either.  We went through our little meeting and parted ways before I looked down to inspect the damage.\r\n\r\nThere was a nickel-sized blister, tough as leather, and so packed with fluid that it was as firm as a pebble.  I knew that walking on it would make it pop, and that it would hurt like the devil when it did.\r\n\r\nBut so far, it hasn't.  It's been five days, and it's still a firm little blister.  It hasn't gotten noticeably better, but it doesn't bother me either.  Go figure.\r\n\r\nBy the way, the roasted pork was really good.  It spurted its juice while I carved into it, and had a beautiful, well-seasoned, smokey taste."

Like a couple of others that I had started and then abandoned, this one was tough to complete.  I needed a finished book to keep from feeling stupid, so I persevered.\r\n<!--more-->\r\nOn the surface, itâ€™s just a story of a pianist who comes to town to do a performance, and who gets bombarded by requests from the locals for little favors, to the point that he canâ€™t keep up with his schedule, and is constantly missing what he was supposed to be doing.  But it all happens in the weirdest of ways.  It turns out that heâ€™s unfamiliar with the city and the people are unfamiliar with him, dispite the fact that he apparently lives with a woman and kid there in town.  At least once, he sees a scene taking place in a basement while he waits outside in a car.  In one chapter, he seems to read the private thoughts of people to whom he talks.  And there are lots of devices lifted right from the library of my dreams:  familiar objects appear way out of place (His childhood family car and friends from England show up there in town.), inappropriate dress\/nudity (He attends a dinner in pajamas, which come open exposing him while he speaks.  No one thinks itâ€™s odd.), and that old dream staple where you travel on and on and on to somewhere, but then when itâ€™s time to go back, youâ€™re right through a trap door back to where you started.\r\n\r\nI expected a payoff at the end of the book, and Iâ€™m not really sure whether I got it or not.  Iâ€™m glad I finished the book.  At one time I misplaced it, and it was tough to not know if there was a payoff at the end.  It would be a good book club read, because I would love to hear other peopleâ€™s opinions of what all happened.\r\n\r\nOne night this week, I had a dream that used many similar techniques.\r\n\r\nI was in Tiger Stadium for the occasion of a football game between LSU and Florida.  I have lots of games set at fictionalized versions of Tiger Stadium, but this time it was the 1940s.  LSU was expected to win by a couple of touchdowns.  \r\n\r\nI was walking through the underside of the stadium, trying to get to my seats.  Rather than the concrete corridor that actually exists, we were funneled through hallways with tile floors and fluorescent lights.  It wasnâ€™t unlike a high school hallway.  Being the 1940s, all the men were wearing those Bear Bryant hats and seersucker suits.  Women were all in dresses and heels.  It was very crowded, and we walked slowly but cheerfully through the crowd.  People would run into friends, stop and chat, and hold up the flow, but no one really seemed to mind.  I ran into several old college friends (all in their seersucker) and did the same thing to others.\r\n\r\nWe heard the game start, the first quarter end, the second quarter end, and the halftime show while walking underneath, trying to get to our seats.  (I say â€œour,â€� but Iâ€™m not 100% certain that I was with anyone else.)  I was getting frustrated, but I was seemingly the only one.  Finally, I settled on a way to get through the crowd and to my seat.\r\n\r\nI pulled my pecker out of my pants, and cleared my throat to draw some attention.  The crowd started to part, slowly at first, and then more quickly.  I left it hanging out of my pants, and like magic, I slid around the stadium in no time.  When I got to the part where I leave the underbelly and walk up into the stadium bowl, I tucked my hog back into my pants, and went into the stadium without any trouble at all.  Other than clearing my way, no one seemed to mind.\r\n"

People have identified something like 900,000 different species of insect alone.  There are over 10,000 species of bird.  How would Noah have kept 20,000 birds from eating 1.8 million bugs?  Does anyone know how Noah supposedly fed all those animals anyway?\r\n\r\nThe point is that if you want to read the Old Testament as a book of stories to provide you some sort of life guidance, then fine.  If you think it's a book that accurately describes how we all came to be where we are, then you should go get sterilized and take yourself out of the gene pool now.\r\n\r\nThat way, we humans evolve toward a smarter species.  I know you don't understand, but it's true."

Then we watched them get grouchy as it came close to nap time.\r\n\r\nI had completely forgotten about the elementary school, little crappy valentines that we had to give everyone in the class.  Starting this with two year olds seems a bit silly, but it gives the teachers something different to do that day, I guess.\r\n<!--more-->\r\nWe had to go yesterday morning and get a pack of these crappy class valentines.  Like two other of the seven sets of parents, we chose ones with cute dog pictures, but fortunately, they were all different.  (A fourth set of parents had a cartoon dog.)\r\n\r\nThis whole thing made me remember an event from when I was in 3rd grade.  I hadn't thought of it since, but I recalled it quite clearly.\r\n\r\nEach student had some little bag attached to the front of his or her desk, and we were supposed to roam the room and drop valentines in each other's bags.  At some point, W dropped a little valentine in a girls bag, and from across the room, I hard her say, \"EWWWWW, BENNY GAVE ME A VALENTINE.\"\r\n\r\nI didn't say anything, and I'm sure my thoughts weren't in the adult language that I recall them today, but my sentiment was definitely this:  \"You dumb bitch.  Of course I'm giving you a valentine.  My mom is making me give every single one of you valentines, even the boys.  If you think this flimsy piece of paper is akin to bringing you flowers and candy, then your head is so far up your own ass that you can probably taste your own stomach acid.\"\r\n\r\nI wish I had been that well-spoken in third grade."

Perhaps the most fun has been in the past week, which featured both the first Mardi Gras as well as Vanya's first birthday with us (and second overall).\r\n\r\nIf you've checked the pictures of the day, you saw that we were the best-costumed, non-prize-winning family in the Baton Rouge dog parade, and that we were holed up at the New Orleans Ritz Carleton with toddler and crazy dogs for a couple of days.  The dog parade was won by who-knows-who, but the fix was in.  The Dille's won one of the places, even though the sponsor was Mr. Dille's employer.  The upside is that the Raising Cane's gift card which was the prize hadn't been loaded with any monetary value.  So a rectangular piece of plastic and an awkward moment at the drive through window was the big prize.\r\n<!--more-->\r\n<table cellpadding=\"2\" align=\"right\"><tr><td width=\"250\" ><img src=\"\/img\/vanyaparade.jpg\"><\/td><td width=\"5\" rowspan=\"2\"><spacer type=\"block\" width=\"5\" height=\"1\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td class=\"caption\" width=\"250\">Begging for Throws<\/td><\/tr><\/table>\r\n\r\nMrs. theskinnyonbenny was supposed to appear in the Muses parade in New Orleans on Thursday night, but thunderstorms, driving rain, and winds that gusted to gale force postponed the parade until Friday.  I stayed with my folks outside of town during the delay days, and drove down late Friday morning.  The dogs were quite pleased to go from accomodations on the floor of an enclosed porch to a luxurious stay in the beds of the Ritz.\r\n\r\nWe had a couple drinks in the afternoon, then a decent nap, which turns out to have been a very good call.  I gave the dogs a walk through the French Quarter while trying to avoid sinkholes with the stroller.  Around 6:30 or 7:00 we caught a cab to go watch parades uptown.\r\n\r\nWe got to our spot about halfway through the first of four parades.  It was a little chilly, but nice.  Vanya sat and watched quietly at first, and then became interested in catching beads when he realized they were raining from the sky.  It took him about the time of one parade to turn into a typical Mardi Gras toddler -- screaming to be held up high every time a float passes.  He clearly enjoyed the bands and the horses, and I dare say it was one of his most fun evenings ever.\r\n\r\n<table cellpadding=\"2\" align=\"right\"><tr><td width=\"5\" rowspan=\"2\"><spacer type=\"block\" width=\"5\" height=\"1\"><\/td><td width=\"250\" ><img src=\"\/img\/vanyabirthday.jpg\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td class=\"caption\" width=\"250\">A birthday shot.<\/td><\/tr><\/table>\r\n\r\nAs the parades dragged on and on, he fought sleep, finally dozing on my shoulder one float before Mrs. theskinnyonbenny's.  By now, it was somewhere around midnight.  But something woke him, and he and Mom got to see each other from float to sideline.  He nodded when asked if he saw Mama, but it's hard to imagine he recognized which one was really her in wig and mask.  Maybe.  We could hear her voice for sure, so he probably really knew she was up there.\r\n\r\nVanya and I got back to the hotel room at 1:30.  He had gotten a second wind and was laughing and teasing me while I tried to change him into pajamas.  Unbelievable.  Mrs. theskinnyonbenny came in a half hour later.\r\n\r\nWe got up early and drove home Saturday.  Everyone but me had long naps, and I cleaned up the back yard for the next day's birthday get together.\r\n\r\nThe birthday thing was nothing special, but Vanya had a lot of fun again.  We ate sausage balls and chicken wings, and rolled right into the Super Bowl once it got late.  \r\n\r\n<a onclick=\"window.open('\/pg3.php?spgmGal=043%20-%20New%20Orleans%20and%20Birthday','043NewOrleansandBirthday','width=1024, height=768, toolbar=no, location = no, directories=no, menubar=no, resizable=yes, scrollbars=no');\" >The pictures<\/a> are more birthday-balanced than this post.\r\n\r\nHappy Mardi Gras!\r\n"

To top that, I didn't have a strong rooting interest in the game, since neither team was local, and since I had no money on the line.  There were bad reasons for me to cheer for either team.\r\n\r\nFor the Giants\/against the Pats,\r\n<!--more-->\r\n<ul><li>  They were always one of those teams that I \"Kind of liked\" as a kid.  I like that they say things like \"The Giant 15 yard line,\" even though it's exactly the same size as the other 15 yard line.<\/li>\r\n\r\n<li>Boston's had their share of success.  The Celtics are rolling, the Sox have won two recent World Series, and the Patriots have already taken home three Super Bowl titles.<\/li>\r\n\r\n<li>Do we really want to see a team go 19-0, and then get a top 10 draft pick?  They're picking number 7 due to some trade or other.<\/li>\r\n\r\n<li>Let's face it.  Bill Belichick is a grouchy old dick.  And he dresses like shit.<\/li>\r\n\r\n<li>It might be fun to witness a team go from historical best to footnote, just like that.  <\/li><\/ul>\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the Pats\/against the Giants,\r\n\r\n<ul><li>The Pats have more LSU players than any other team on the league.<\/li>\r\n\r\n<li>The Patriots wore a number 91 on their helmet for the entire season to honor former Tiger and Patriot Marquise Hill, who died last summer in a jet ski mishap on Lake Ponchatrain.<\/li>\r\n\r\n<li>We could finally shut up those old '72 Dolphins, and their dumb champagne for the last team to lose every year.<\/li>\r\n\r\n<li>It might be fun to witness history.<\/li><\/ul>\r\n\r\nAnother reason that I avoided pregame stuff the past couple of weeks is that it seems every talking head has copied Chris Berman's thing where he always calls them, \"The New York Football Giants.\"  With one guy, it's a quirk that I can over look.  With everyone doing it, it's fingernails on a chalkboard.\r\n\r\nDo they really think we need the \"Football\" in there?  We might accidentally think they're playing the baseball Giants?  The baseball Giants that moved out of New York in the late 1950s?\r\n\r\nAnd besides, when St. Louis had both baseball and football teams named Cardinals, I never heard anyone refer to \"The Saint Louis Football Cardinals.\"  \r\n\r\nSpeaking of Chris Berman, here's a clip that appears to be at least a few years old  (UPDATE:  8 years, if you look at the sign behind him), but is just popping up everywhere now. Don't watch if you're offended by bad words. \r\n\r\n<object width=\"425\" height=\"355\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/v\/tnC8BtNBNLo&rel=1\"><\/param><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"transparent\"><\/param><embed src=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/v\/tnC8BtNBNLo&rel=1\" type=\"application\/x-shockwave-flash\" wmode=\"transparent\" width=\"425\" height=\"355\"><\/embed><\/object>\r\n\r\nAnyway, I found myself rooting for the Patriots most of the game, but when the Giants were driving, I was pulling for them too.  I guess I just wanted some offense after the lack of it through the first three quarters.  No sense in me recapping anything, but needless to say, good game.\r\n\r\nTom Petty did halftime, and he did nothing to shake my notion that he really isn't a big enough star to give him the Super Bowl half time show.  I forgot about the song \"American Girl,\" and it's better than I remember, but other than that, kind of a yawn.  He has about tripled his weight in the last 26 years, don't you think?  I think he went from roughly 90 pounds to a good 270.\r\n\r\nThey could have found someone both better and more currently relevant.  Off the top of my head, and just rock and roll acts that are known by the masses:  My Chemical Romance, Green Day, The Killers, Foo Fighters, U2, Coldplay, Radiohead.  Is Arcade Fire still too obscure?\r\n\r\nOne more broadcast note:  how about that fossil that they showed standing on the Giants sideline, wrapping up his final season after 60 years as some nobody in the organization.  I can't believe that a player hasn't run into him and broken into tiny bits.  He looked like Mr. Burns standing over there.  \r\n\r\nI hope they give him a ring.\r\n\r\n"

The radio has 6 buttons, each of which hold two stations' worth of presets.  Push it once for the first station, and push it again for the second.  After almost a year of messing with it, I have the buttons laid out like this (actual station names listed in case you are familiar and curious):\r\n\r\nButton 1:  Current, modern, alt-rock stations (Left of Center, Alt Nation)\r\n\r\nButton 2:  Hard rock that I like (Faction, Punk Rock)\r\n\r\nButton 3:  Nastalgia (First Wave, 80s)\r\n<!--more-->\r\nButton 5:  Country, but not the country that you hear on FM.  One is a channel called Outlaw country, which specializes in the heavy-drinking, punch a guy in the mouth type of country music, and the other is Margaritaville, which is mostly Jimmy Buffet, with other laid back similar sounding artists mixed in.\r\n\r\nButton 6:  My \"grown up rock and roll\" button (Spectrum, E Street Radio).  These are only probationally pemanent, and could easily be replaced if somoene on button 4 steps up and gives me great entertainment.  But for now, they seem to have settled into their slots well.\r\n\r\nButton 4 rotates among all the other good channels that didn't quite make it to the point where they got a permanent button.  Right now, one of the stations is the Blues channel.  It plays a lot of good Clapton and Stevie Ray Vaughn, but it goes back to old black guys that I've never heard of as well. \r\n\r\nThe Blues channels on XM, Serius, and cable stations are probably the only places where you can regularly hear songs about growing\/farming cotton.  There was one such song on my way in this morning.  In this particlar tune, the narrator's cotton crop had been good, but the price of cotton in the fall was quite low.\r\n\r\nOne more observation:  I've never, ever, ever heard a female vocalist on the Blues channel.\r\n\r\nAt some point, all of the songs on this station will start to sound the same, at which point it will be time to find a new station to take its place.  Old School Rap, Brittish Pop, Hair Nation, and several others are waiting on deck.\r\n"

Lost behind even that was the death of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.imdb.com\/name\/nm0578510\/\">Allan Melvin<\/a>, who you might remember as Alice's boyfriend Sam the Butcher on <i>The Brady Bunch<\/i>.\r\n\r\nUntil I saw this tidbit today, I never knew his name, but Allan Melvin was constantly in reruns that I watched growing up.  In the past week, I saw him on two different episodes of Andy Griffith -- once as an army sergeant trying to enlist Earnest T. Bass, and once as a robber of some sort who was trying to hide out in Mayberry.  Without checking his IMDB page, I could definitely remember him as Sam the butcher, Sgt. Hacker in <i>Golmer Pyle USMC<\/i>, and as Archie Bunker's recurring friend.\r\n<!--more-->\r\n(Speaking of Golmer Pyle USMC, I'm probably the only one ever to have seen all 5 or 6 years' worth of episodes.  It never dawned on my while watching this as a kid how unlikely Golmer Pyle as a marine would be.  It was a fish-out-of-water show as much as <i>Green Acres<\/i>.  Even more unlikely, Golmer and his Sergeant were located at the same base for all of these years, and Golmer never rose above the rank of Private.)\r\n\r\nMelvin made his living bouncing from episode to episode on shows where the producers liked him, but TV fans today would never let a show get away with having a guy play different characters in different episodes.  A couple of seasons ago, I started checking <a href=\"http:\/\/lostpedia.com\/wiki\/Main_Page\">nerdy sites about <i>Lost<\/i><\/a>, and the die-hard fans not only know the islanders who sort of hover in the background, but they have pretty educated theories about where these people were seated on the plane.  And on that show, you're <i>supposed<\/i> to notice when a person shows up in person A's flashback in season 2, and then shows up again in unrelated person B's flashback in season three.  Thus my need to check such things on the internet.\r\n\r\nI've become a big fan of these running dramas with huge, huge casts, with entangled plots that almost require a level of study.  There are only a few shows that do this well.  I just started watching the remake of <i>Battlestar Galactica<\/i> on the strength of 5 or 6 recommendations.  It's the same way, and like <i>Lost<\/i>, it features at least five hotties.  \r\n\r\nI'm also going to go back to DVD's of <i>The Wire<\/i>.  I've watched about half of the first season, but by the third season, it was getting praise from all quarters.  ESPN's Bill Simmons -- who favors bad television, still watching new seasons of <i>The Real World<\/i> even though he's my age -- and Slate political columnist David Platz, who probably favors better programming than that, both called season 4 of <i>The Wire<\/i> \"The best thirteen hours of television ever made.\"  The half of one season that I watched was pretty good.  And if this writer's strike continues a lot longer, I'll have plenty of time to watch the whole series.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, there's nothing exciting me on the television at all.  The bad singer shows on <i>American Idol<\/i> will be fun for the next week or two, but after that, I'm not excited.  <i>Celebrity Apprentice<\/i> is awful.  The game show with the people who have to be truthful verified by lie detector kept my attention for fifteen minutes, but it's bad too.\r\n\r\nSo I'm left watching reruns of shows featuring Allan Melvin.\r\n\r\nIf you have a forgotten jewel of a show that I can get on DVD, please let me know."

I had gone through pretty many before our last trip to Russia (55 of 90 lessons), and while it was definitely helpful, the actual Russians speak way too quickly for me to understand even the occasional word or phrase that sounded familiar to my ear.  But I think it would be cool to speak Russian to my Russian kid, so I'll keep trying.\r\n\r\nThere are two words that strike me as funny.  The first I learned was the word for \"Red Square.\"  It's ÐšÑ€Ð°Ñ�Ð½Ð°Ñ� Ð¿Ð»Ð¾Ñ‰Ð°Ð´ÑŒ in Russian, pronounced something like, \"Grassnaya Bloshit.\"  If I think about what neighbors think if they happen to observe me waking the streets at night, clad in jacket and pajama pants, mumbling \"bloshit\" over and over -- well, it just breaks me up.  It was several times through this lesson before I could get through without hysterical laughter, which probably made me look even more insane.\r\n\r\nThe other word that cracks me up is the word for the number sixteen.  It's pronounced almost exactly like the sentence in English, \"She snots it.\"  Say it quickly, and you can say ÑˆÐµÑ�Ñ‚Ð½Ð°Ð´Ñ†Ð°Ñ‚ÑŒ (sixteen) in Russian.\r\n<!--more-->\r\nThere are a few funny things about Russia itself that I don't remember posting before.

I'm not sure why, but we observed it several times.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Russians are far more likely to be roaming the town with no shirt (men, at least) than to wear shorts on a warm day.  Again, I don't know why.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Russian toilet bowls are much deeper and steeper than ours.  This eliminates spalshback on the buttocks, but requires that a toilet brush be stationed by each commode, so you can clear the skid marks on the side after each use.  This probably leads to cleaner bowls in general, but swishing ones on skid marks while traveling does get old.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>When an airplane full of Russians lands, everyone applauds.  How disturbing is that?<\/li>\r\n\t<li>When an airplane full of Russians comes to a halt, many people jump up and sprint toward the front to try to get out as quickly as possible rather than file out in our orderly fashion.

They didn't run their mouths too much when they took an early lead, and then they were gracious in defeat, congratulating our fans on the season.

The most absurd one was the festival of lights in downtown Baton Rouge, where the whole downtown was decked out in full Norman Rockwell Holiday tradition.  Most of my fellow citizens even changed out of shorts and put on long pants so that we could pretend that early December was winter here.\r\n\r\nThey had a group dancing in costume from <i>The Nutcracker<\/i>, which entertained the kids.  The girls like ballet by their very nature, and Vanya is a Russian, so he felt the call of his motherland.  I felt him bounce up and down on my shoulders as he watched a bear jump around a girl without any reason that I could fathom.\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\r\n<table cellpadding=\"2\" align=\"right\">\r\n<tr>\r\n<td width=\"5\" rowspan=\"2\"><spacer type=\"block\" width=\"5\" height=\"1\"><\/td>\r\n<td width=\"300\" ><img src=\"http:\/\/theskinnyonbenny.com\/img\/gal\/040%20-%20December%202007\/resIMG_20071130_3513.JPG\" width=\"285\"><\/td>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td class=\"caption\" width=\"300\">Baton Rouge's downtown ice rink.

I touched it, and it wasn't as slippery as ice, so the kids mostly stayed on their feet as they plowed across the surface in a giant mass.  These were all strangers, as ours are a bit little for such shenanigans.\r\n\r\nWe listened to a big band play Christmas songs, caught a glimpse of Santa Claus in the Old State Capitol, and searched downtown in a futile attempt to find a chili dog.\r\n\r\nThe next weekend, we cut down a tree at the tree farm, which we've done for years and years.  Nothing new about this adventure, and we're quite glad that our son is too young to know to beg for hayrides and candy at the store.  Instead, he gave cheery \"Bye!\" (pronounced in his North Louisiana accent) and made puckered kiss lips at the staff.\r\n\r\nWe didn't find him a suitable stocking at this place, so we went home and shopped on the internet.  The one we picked looked good on its picture, but when it arrived, I pulled it out of the box, and then couldn't suppress an, \"Oh my God.\"\r\n\r\n<table cellpadding=\"2\" align=\"right\">\r\n<tr>\r\n<td width=\"5\" rowspan=\"2\"><spacer type=\"block\" width=\"5\" height=\"1\"><\/td>\r\n<td width=\"300\" ><img src=\"http:\/\/theskinnyonbenny.com\/img\/vanya_stocking.jpg\" width=\"285\"><\/td>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td class=\"caption\" width=\"300\">Vanya's 2007 stocking.<\/td>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n<\/table>\r\n\r\nIt is a velvety red stocking with his name at the top.  But instead of a classy looking gold embroidered name, which we pictured, they manufactured the name part by writing it in Elmer's glue, then dipping the stocking in gold glitter.  If we had high hopes for a future drag queen, this stocking would be fine, but we need to find a different one before next year.\r\n\r\nThere's really nothing to report over the last couple of weeks of December.  Pretty much all the dinner, presents, family visiting, etc. were nice.\r\n\r\nCrystal and Brent came down on Saturday after Christmas, and we spent the next three days like this:\r\n\r\n<ul><li>Saturday:  went out drinking in the French Quarter from about 4:00 in the afternoon until 3:00 in the morning.  I was having a fine time, until I stopped drinking around 9:30 so that I could drive everyone home.<\/li><li>Sunday:  Brent and I escape the wives and spent seven hours drinking beer and watching NFL games.  We get home (bearing pizza) to surprisingly non-annoyed wives, eat a few bites, and fall asleep around 8:00.<\/li><li>Monday:  Fresh and rested from his early bedtime, Brent joins me for TV at 5:30 in the morning, where I've been channel surfing for at least an hour.  We watch the same NFL highlights a couple times through, and then start a movie.  I fall back asleep.  Later, we get up, clean the house, cook some grub, and host a New Year's Eve party.  I cut myself off and go to bed around 2:30.  Mrs. theskinnyonbenny and Brent are up until 4:00.<\/li><li>New Years Day:  I fail to lift my butt off the couch while bidding them goodbye.  I nap when possible, and don't get out of pajamas all day.  At 3:30 in the afternoon, I start cleaning up the wreck from New Years Eve.  I put in a preemptive request for a new liver.<\/li><\/ul>\r\n\r\nHoliday season really keeps flying here.  Carnival season ( = king cakes to eat) starts one day within the next week.  The BCS Championship game is on Monday, followed by a really early Mardi Gras.  A lot of the parades start before the end of this month.  Early February is Mardi Gras day, followed closely by the NBA All Star game in New Orleans.  Then, of course, is my favorite day (Saint Paddy's), and then we can really call it the end of the holiday season. \r\n\r\nI posted a bunch of photos from the whole month <a onclick=\"window.open('\/pg3.php?spgmGal=040%20-%20December%202007','040December2007','width=1024, height=768, toolbar=no, location = no, directories=no, menubar=no, resizable=yes, scrollbars=no');\" >here<\/a>.\r\n"

Fox doesn't cover college football the rest of the year, and these aren't the scrubs who get sent to broadcast Saints games, so I don't recognize the voices.\r\n\r\nAnyway, Gonzales got teary-eyed on the phone with the offensive coordinator after the play, and the play by play guy pulled the cleverest 20-odd year old quote right out of memory:  \"Tito, get me a tissue.\"\r\n<!--more-->\r\nFor my sake, he didn't have to site the source.  As a teenager, I watched the,\/i Eddie Murphy stand-up routine on HBO dozens and dozens of times.  I don't remember if it was <i>Raw<\/i> or <i>Delerious<\/i>, but it was the earlier, funnier one.  Eddie is making fun of Michael Jackson.  He imitates MJ singing, \"She's Out of My Life,\" getting choked up while singing the song.  Finally, he has to pause his singing and ask, \"Tito, get me a tissue.\"\r\n\r\nGreat pull during the game today.  I'm impressed.\r\n\r\nSinging from the <i>Off the Wall<\/i> album isn't the only thing that makes this one seem dated.  I remember that this particular stand up concert is where I first heard of that new disease called \"Aids.\"  As I recall, Murphy was astounded that there existed a new sexually transmitted disease that could actually kill.  He asked, \"What's next?  One where you stick your dick in and explode?  The bitch be laying there saying, 'Maybe I should see a doctor about this.' \"\r\n\r\nOr something pretty close to that anyway.\r\n\r\nGetting back to the game, West Virginia just scored again.  It's 10:45 PM Central time.  I'm calling it.  This one is officially ugly.\r\n\r\nHere's something funny:  at the beginning of the West Virginia fight song, they play that four-tone tune that's so popular on clocks and doorbells.  After that, they jump right into a normal sounding fight song.  I don't know how I've watched football this long without noticing.  I can't wait for them to score again."

I closed my eyes.  She whisper barked again.\r\n\r\nI tried to reach, but she kept moving toward the door a few steps and looking back.  She was asking me to follow her.\r\n\r\nHaving never pulled the Lassie behavior before, I was curious.  What sort of danger could she be bringing me to?  I followed her into the den, where she jumped up on the couch with Blossom.  Blossom looked up and wagged her tail a little.  Lily rested her had on the bigger dog's rump.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure why Lily wanted me to come out there with her.  Perhaps it was her version of a fire drill, and she just wanted to see if she could get me moving in case there was an actual emergency.  I'm not sure, but she definitely asked me to follow her out for some reason.\r\n\r\nI layed down on the couch with the two dogs and fell back asleep.

		"post_content" : "Last week was LSU's homecoming week.  The College of Engineering had an alumni reunion on Friday night, which I wouldn't have known about except that my friend Jeremy emailed me looking for a date.  He's obviously afraid to face nerds alone.\r\n\r\nIt was to have beer, wine, and food, and it was to be free, and home is only a couple of miles from campus, so I figured I would go.\r\n\r\nI have no idea what the real numbers are, but my best guess (and I'm really trying here -- not just making up numbers like on my previous post) is that there are at least 10,000 College of Engineering alums in the Baton Rouge area.  I'm going to guess that another 10,000 were in town for the football game the next day.\r\n<!--more-->\r\nOf the 20,000 of us who were already in town anyway, about 150 of us actually made the event.  I might be being generous, because a lot of the people I talked to ended up being current students and employees of the college.  The employees were the ones who had done organizing and had to be there.  The students were the nearing graduation, scared about their lack of job prospect, looking desperately for any networking that might help them out.  Now that I write it, I feel kind of sorry for those nerds.  And nerds they were.  At least the few that I talked to, and especially one bald kid who grilled me about my career, and suggested that the work that I had done had probably been \"easy.\"\r\n\r\nEarly on, I was excited about a table with a bunch of old yearbooks.  I went right to the one that featured a couple of photographs of my Velvet Elvis, not to be confused with our boat named <i>Velvet Elvis<\/i> in homage to this earlier work of art.  Yes my friends, this was an actual painting of Elvis on Velvet.  Better yet, it was a profile of fat 70s Elvis, in a white jumper, with a little tear running down his cheek.  I couldn't actually find the photographs in the yearbook that night, but I found a \"thank you\" written to me on the credits page in the back.\r\n\r\nNext year, I'm going to dig through every page of that book and go to this thing with the relevant page numbers memorized.\r\n\r\nOther than Jeremy, I saw not one single person that I ever knew in college.  I saw no professors that ever instructed me.  And my most entertaining conversation was with an older guy who was either drunk or crazy or both, who took 20 minutes to tell a tale of some riot in the 1960s that occurred because students wallowed in the mud after a big rain storm.  I'm suspicious of the accuracy of his recollection, but that was his story.\r\n\r\nThe good thing about so few people being there is that it gave pretty good odds on the door prizes.  I won a short but wide purple coffee mug that says, \"LSU Engineering.\"  I drink from it with pride, and I wonder -- as an engineer -- why it never occurred to me that a wide and short coffee mug would help with my propensity to tump over my tall thin travel mugs, staining all of the papers on my desk.  It's been a problem that I've just lived with for many many years.\r\n\r\nThe other main occupier of time was a tour of a new dorm building, just opening this spring for Freshman engineering students.  It was nice, mostly because it was new.  It had a library, some small classrooms, study rooms, and offices where professors and advisors are going to be forced to keep hours.  So the young students can pad downstairs in pajamas and get help with their calculus without ever having to leave their building.  Isn't that nice?\r\n\r\nI had consumed three or four beers by the time we started this tour, and I had to use the restroom.  It wasn't an emergency, but it was serious.  When the group was looking at one of the sample dorm rooms, I wandered into the one next door, which was empty.  I put down my empty beer bottle, walked into the connecting restroom, and started working up the nerve to use the toilet right there.\r\n\r\nJust then, the group opened the door on the other side of the room.  It seems that two dorm rooms share the same toilet, and they have doors that connect from either side.  I was just a couple of minutes from being busted mid-stream by a group of residential housing tour guides and mostly elderly engineering alums.\r\n\r\nIn retrospect, I wish I had gotten caught peeing, as it would be a much better story that way."

Since our house gets about six groups a year -- and all of those are teenagers without costume -- we drove over to our friends' neighborhood.\r\n\r\nIt turns out that they live a block away from an area that takes the holiday VERY seriously.  There were people pulling hay wagons full of kids with four-wheelers, lights and moving decorations all over, and enough sugared-up little people to make you look for the beginning of the yellow-brick road.\r\n<!--more-->\r\nVanya enjoyed the crowd and all, but it took him a little while to get the drift of what was happening.  At first, he thought he was just supposed to follow the bigger kids up the walk, and then when they would turn to go back toward the road, he would do the same, missing out on his chance for candy.\r\n\r\nAfter a few houses, he got the idea that whatever the people were dropping in his sack was something to be coveted.  I'm not sure he ever figured out that it was candy.  Always a nice kid, there were a couple of times where he set his bag down, reached in, and pulled out an exchange offer for the grown-up in front of him.\r\n\r\nWe got to a section that was less crowded, and the people really took the time to talk to him and pay attention.  After that, he very much wanted to barge into everyone's house, just to converse.  The fact that his only conversation starter is \"bye-bye\" was not a detriment.\r\n\r\nI bet we went to 15-20 houses, with long stays for socializing at several of them.  We were out late enough that we heard a voice down the street telling a different group, \"HALLOWEEN'S OVER!  GO HOME!\"  Not long after that, we walked back to the mother ship and let the over-hyper kids amuse themselves while we relaxed with a drink.  We got home late and very tired.\r\n\r\nI had thought that the candy haul was good.  But on Thursday, the dogs got in the bag, and when I got to it, there was nothing but nubbin old junk candy.  I didn't know dogs could distinguish good candy from junk, but either they can, they got really lucky, or he didn't get as good a haul as I originally thought.  No way to know which of those is the actual case.\r\n\r\nI'm working on a month and a half's worth of pictures that will go up in three different collections.  Halloween pics are part of all of that.  They should all be up this week."

The team sport equivalent would be something like Babe Ruth shaving with Michael Jordan.\r\n\r\nBut then they go in and throw the soccer guy in the mix.  I won't be bothered to look up his name, but I never heard of the guy outside of the commercial, and I'm one of the few Americans who at least watch some World Cup highlights every four years.\r\n\r\nWhat bugs me most is the three of them doing some fake clowning around at the end.  As if the three of them would have shaved, gotten together in their cleanest duds, and then walked shoulder-to-shoulder, Reservoir Dogs style, but clowning with each other.\r\n\r\nThat's about as plausible as Tiger Woods driving an Oldsmobile as his every day ride.  (Or is it Cadillac that he endorses?  Whichever.)\r\n\r\n<center><img src=\"\/img\/greenline.gif\"><\/center>\r\n\r\nSpeaking of Gillette, I might or might not have mentioned that when Gameday came for the Virginia Tech game, they had a tent set up with a pretty little Mexican girl, who would sit you down and give you a shave.  Next to that was a camera where you got a minute to act goofy, and they were supposed to email you the video.\r\n\r\nWhen my shave was over, a lady was just starting to record her own video.  I took off my shirt, threw on my purple and gold wrestling mask, and walked into her scene.  We stood together -- crazy man and innocent middle-aged woman -- and yelled for the Tigers to win.\r\n\r\nToward the end of that week, I got an email from Gillette, and I was excited to see how this looked in the video.  But they had somehow screwed up, and the video they sent me was two elderly men cheering for the Tigers.  It was rather dull and lame.\r\n\r\nLast week, they emailed me the same video again.  I assume that they mixed up the emails from the Florida Gameday trip with the Virginia Tech trip, but I feel pretty confident that they're doing the same thing every Saturday, and then emailing hundreds -- if not thousands -- of people videos of strangers.\r\n\r\nTheir marketing people need to get it together."

I speak of the one hour difference between the Eastern and Central time zone.\r\n\r\nFor example, last night, I picked up Mrs. theskinnyonbenny from her work stuff at 5:00.  We went back to the condo, let her change clothes, walked into the tiny downtown, picked a restuarant, ate, had a couple of drinks, and walked back home.  We sat down, turned on the TV, only to find that it was still 20 minutes <i>before<\/i> the start of prime time programming.  \r\n\r\nWhat the heck?  \r\n<!--more-->\r\nWhat do you East Coasters do with all that time after work and before TV?  \r\n\r\nHere's another catch:  I often fall asleep before the end of Monday Night Football, but this week -- tired from the Sunday drive here -- I was asleep before kickoff.  How many millions of viewers do they lose every week?  It seems to me like it would be better for the ratings if they started earlier and gave the heavily populated East Coast a chance to see the end of the games.  I understand that this means that a lot of West Coast worker-bees would miss the kickoff, but everyone would be able to see the end of the game.  Isn't the end the most important part?\r\n\r\nI think we're nearing the day and age where programmers can assume that their viewers have a DVR.  So West Coast people could catch kickoff when they get home to work, fast forward through commercials, and be up to real time by the end of the game.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of DVRs, TIVO is making a strong case for coming back from the dead.  We ditched TIVO a couple of years ago, as the cable company's DVR had two tuners and HD capability.  TIVO has caught up with these features, and offers some features that the cable company doesn't yet.\r\n\r\n<ul><li>The ability to see what your other tuner is doing, and to jump immediately to it.<\/li><li>The ability to use your home computer as overflow storage for TV programs, so you're effectively unlimited in the amount of shows you can record and keep.<\/li><li>The ability to watch shows record on one TIVO box on a different TIVO box.<\/li><li>The ability to watch recorded shows on your computer, or to copy them to your IPOD or other portable device for viewing later.<\/li><li>The ability to play your music files from your computer through your home entertainment system without hooking up anything other than the TIVO box.<\/li><li>The ability to buy movies from Amazon, watch them on TIVO immediately, and keep them on your local computer forever, so you have them any time you want them.<\/li><li>The ability to schedule shows to record over the internet, so I can set my TIVO to record something that I find out about while I'm traveling.<\/li><\/ul>\r\n\r\nCool, hunh?\r\n\r\nThe real motivation for this switch was that Cox refused us a third DVR box, citing policy to allow everyone to get at least one.  Mrs. theskinnyonbenny asked them to elaborate.\r\n\r\n\"So there's a shortage of them?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, we have hundreds and hundreds here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, we're willing to pay an extra $15\/month for a box that's earning you nothing by sitting in a closet.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm sorry, you can't have another one.\"\r\n\r\nAs money allows, I would like to replace all of the DVRs that we have with TIVO boxes.  That way, we can watch any recorded program from any room in the house."

Then, it dawned on me that Wilson was approaching as a friend rather than moving in to fight, so it had to be our cat.\r\n\r\nI called \"Kitty Kitty Kitty,\" and he trotted toward me.

If you care, you've already seen the highlights and heard or read about what happened on the field.  \r\n<!--more-->\r\nIf you don't care enough to have been paying attention, the Saints have started with three straight losses, and none of them were really close.  The million dollar question is why last year's best offense in the league has suddenly become ineffective.  You might have also missed the \"when it rains it pours\" note that Deuce McAllister is out for the season, and the pessimistic note that an ACL injury for a running back at his age is often the end of a career.  Man oh man.\r\n\r\nYes, the Saints that we know and love are back.  And so for the first time in franchise history, 30,000 people know how it feels to be on the waiting list to spend hundreds of dollars for season tickets to the crappiest team in the history of the NFL.  \r\n\r\nOn the bright side, the bloody marys in the Superdome are top-notch.  We should refer to it as a waiting list for Superdome bloody marys.\r\n\r\nThe crowd -- including Eddie and me -- were loud and enthusiastic in the first quarter.  After that, we were loud and enthusiastic on defensive 3rd downs until the middle of the third quarter.  After that, it was pretty quiet.\r\n\r\nTo blow off some frustration, Eddie and I stopped a twelve-year-old kid on his way out of the stadium.  He was wearing a Drew Brees jersey, and Brees had 3 interceptions and a fumble, so we beat the kid up.\r\n\r\nThat felt good, so we decided to do it again.  Not wishing to suffer any personal injury, this time we found a chubby woman in a Brees jersey and beat her up.\r\n\r\nWhile these fans might have deserved their ass-kickings, I feel kind of bad about the two Chinese students outside the Superdome.  Their backpacks and calculus books suggest that they were just looking for a library in which to study, when they got beat up for no reason.\r\n\r\n<center><img src=\"\/img\/greenline.gif\"><\/center>\r\n\r\nOutside of the game, it was a fun night.  On top of our little fantasies about pummeling the young, female, and Asian, we made fun of a friend of ours from college, who I'll just call \"Troy.\"\r\n\r\n(I just think it's goofy when people put names in quotation marks.  His name really was Troy.  We were actually friends with two guys named Troy, but we called the other one Guido, so as not to confuse ourselves.)\r\n\r\nTroy's claim to fame is that he cheated his way to a Mechanical Engineering degree.  It took him six or seven years, but he finally made it through.  Back in the early 90s, copy machines were still big, heavy, expensive devices where you had to feed change for every page you wanted to copy.  Troy copied so much homework, he actually had one of these in his apartment.  It takes a lot of copying of 5 cent pages to make it a better option to get your own copy machine.  We used to make fun of the tan on his face from the bluish light that slid back and forth during the course of making a copy.\r\n\r\nLSU back then still had dot matrix printers that fed those huge wide sheets of paper that had thick blue-green lines.  Troy once printed out a bunch of code, folded the big printout into a seat liner, parked his behind on it during a test, and pulled it out for reference during a test.  I can't imagine how he didn't get caught pulling out the big wide green sheet, but he was obviously a master at cheating.\r\n\r\nThe equivalent in today's classroom would be a student who sits on his laptop during tests, and discretely pulls it out from under his ass to reference during a test."

I'd love to read a real report of it, rather than just get the spin from the news network.\r\n\r\nAll I know about the Jena thing is through the minute of coverage on national news and word of mouth.  I haven't read any of the detailed newspaper accounts.  Why let my opinion be tainted by facts?\r\n\r\nIt sounds to me like some black students found themselves congregating where the white kids usually hang out, white kids went back and hung nooses there, so black kids administered the deserved ass-kickings.  \r\n<!--more-->\r\nBy the way, is it still 1955 in Jena?  When I was a student -- 20 years ago -- the black kids and the white kids were allowed to hang together.  This was public school in Arkansas.\r\n\r\nIt doesn't sound like anyone got beat up all that badly, and there were no weapons involved.  All that needed to happen was to suspend or expel everyone involved.  But I guess the white kids got off scot-free, and the black kids got thrown in the clink.  \r\n\r\nI don't like that they call the arrested kids, \"The Jena 6.\"  It's an obvious attempt to get us to mentally associate them with \"The Little Rock 9.\"  While it's possible that they've suffered an injustice, it can not compare to Little Rock in 1957.  I don't think it's possible for any student today -- no  matter what his race -- to imagine what it must have felt like to have to be escorted to class by National Guardsmen, to be taunted by fellow students and teaches, or to have legitimate concern about being murdered just for the offense of trying to go to school.\r\n\r\nIf you finish your blog reading at work today and still have some time to goof off, <a href=\"http:\/\/sportsillustrated.cnn.com\/2007\/writers\/the_bonus\/04\/05\/little.rock0409\/2.html\" target=\"_blank\">this article<\/a> is a long, but really good one.

He didn't.  I pretended to dislike songs with lots of drumming.  He still liked them.

He had to be picked up; he had to see where this beautiful melody came from.\r\n\r\nHe examined the speakers.  He examined the ipod.  And he danced with an abandon that self-conscious adults can't possibly know.  He shook his arms with excitement, like a TV preacher's parishioner who has just had his cancer cast away by the TV preacher.  He joined Ringo Starr, banging drum rhythms on the metal hood over the stove.\r\n\r\nWhen it was over, Mrs. theskinnyonbenny came into the kitchen to see what was so exciting.  We played Yellow Submarine again.\r\n\r\nAnd it was just as big a hit.\r\n\r\nI know myself well enough to know that hearing Yellow Submarine three times in a row is enough to send me into a wild-man, foaming-at-the-mouth rage, so we stopped listening to the song at that point.\r\n\r\nLet me know if you find yourself singing this number to yourself later in the day."

But this year -- now that both teams have the talent to make it happen -- I am full of anxiety.  I don't know how to handle realistic high expectations.\r\n\r\nThis is best illustrated by the dream that I had earlier this week where Mississippi State beat our Tigers by a touchdown in tonight's game.  Predictive football game dreams aren't new to me, but they usually involve a bigger game than this one.  A final four basketball game or regular season football game against Florida, for example.\r\n<!--more-->\r\nThe year that an unheralded LSU team beat Steve Spurrier's number one ranked Gators, my dream had not only predicted the win, but the final score it predicted was only off by 3 points.  And there was a missed field goal in that game that would have put the final score right on the money.\r\n\r\nMy sports anxiety dreams aren't always right, but they're right often enough that I'm nervous about tonight's game.  I've been listening to pregame talk since early afternoon, and not even State's head coach sounds much like he thinks they can win.  \r\n\r\nThe superstitious stuff is working against us too.  I've yet to feel that I have a lucky hat for this football season.  There's still no Mike the Tiger (although Roscoe the Tiger sits hidden on campus, waiting to be anointed.  They get to change names, like the pope, when they get to be the actual Mike).  Also, we're going to go to Joel's tonight, and the Tigers are 0-1 in games that I've watched there.\r\n\r\nI hope we can pull out the win.\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdate on 9\/4\/07:  Yes, I'm glad that I was being a big ninny."

This is so she could budget the expense of a full set of replacement keys.  She mentioned that she had last seen them being used as a toy in the study.  Had I looked in the boxes by the door in there?\r\n\r\nOf course, my keys were right there.\r\n\r\nNow, if I can just find the attachment that allows me to disassemble the juicer for cleaning, we might actually get to drink juice again."

They may read experts' opinions of what to expect on the field any number of places. I thought they might need to read about what to expect in the hours leading up to the game. The rest of this post is directed to them.\r\n\r\nFirst, you should understand the setting that you enter. I will have shown up at around 5:00 or 6:00 in the morning. It will be dark, and it will look like an abandoned street fair or refugee city -- all tents and no people. I'll unload cooking stuff, bloody marys, alcohol, ice chests, tables, chairs, radio, television, etc. and start spreading it around.\r\n<!--more-->\r\nOnce that's done, I might walk around and see what else is going on. There will be others like me. There will be a handful of people in tents, and there will be at least one group of loud drunk people who have been partying all night.\r\n\r\nBefore daylight, the group of joggers will pass, and I'll give them some sort of jeer and suggest that they would be better off eating donuts with me. By then, at least one other person probably will have shown up. We will have read the pregame breakdown in the sports page, and be ready for the day to really get started.\r\n\r\nI'm guessing that you Hokies will get there around 10:30 or 11:00. The first thing that you will notice is that it's hot. Don't think your recent summer vacation in Florida or Mexico or Las Vegas is going to prepare you for the early September heat in Baton Rouge. It's likely to be a gut-altering, searing, torturous kind of heat, the likes of which you've never imagined. The humidity will cause your forearm to stick to your bicep every time you move your arm. And I strongly recommend boxer-briefs, as the sweaty mess beneath your scrotums is liable to chafe your delicate Virginia skin.\r\n\r\n(A real coonass will steam his oysters down there, and serve them with a fishbowl of beer.)\r\n\r\nYour hosts will insist that you put a drink in your hand right away, and insist that one remains there for the nine and a half hours â€” yes <i>nine and a half<\/i> â€” until kickoff. Pacing is the name of the game on this particular Saturday. Especially with the heat, some of the fans on campus will drink to the point where they donâ€™t make the game. It wouldnâ€™t be dumb to covertly take a water every third or fourth drink, although you will be ridiculed if caught.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of ridicule, the tiger fans are going to be tough on you. You will be called \"tiger bait\" all day long. Sometimes, youâ€™ll be addressed that way, as if were an old college nickname, and sometimes, it will be chanted at you by a crowd.\r\n\r\nIf it's still in the news, expect some Michael Vick jokes. Most will not be very clever, but someone will set up something or other thatâ€™s pretty funny.\r\n\r\nCome to think of it, if I had the time and money, I would get a stuffed pit bull, a VT Michael Vick jersey, put the dog in the jersey and in a noose, and hang it from the nearest tree. Like I said, not very clever.\r\n\r\nAnd I cringe to write it, but once the tiger fans are good and drunk, we will get to hear at least one poor attempt at comedy about campus shootings. Something like, \"Once dem tiguhs are throo wit you, you gonna want to shoot up campus all over again.\"  Yes, there will be assholes there. You canâ€™t put 100,000 people in a square mile, have them drink for eight straight hours, and not have 10,000 assholes in the group. \r\n\r\nBut among the other 90,000, youâ€™ll find good people. Almost everyone who cooked -- friends and strangers alike -- will be proud of their food and invite you to partake. Just wander up to any group empty handed, ask \"what is that youâ€™ve got in the pot?\" and walk away with a plate and a beer and the email address of your new friends. Maybe you'll meet them again at a bowl site some day.\r\n\r\nThe next thing you know, all of the people beside us will start packing up all those chairs and tents. You'll realize how much noise you've been subjecting yourself to all day as generators shut down, stereos turn off, and people walk toward the stadium. We'll keep everything up and going until the last minute. Often, we keep everything assembled for a post-game continuation of the party, but this game wonâ€™t end until close to midnight, so by the time you leave (shamed) in the third quarter, our party will be gone.\r\n"

I have always been first to admit my admiration of <em>The Price is Right<\/em>, which extended to making class schedule choices based on my ability to catch the show during a lunch break.\r\n<!--more-->\r\nFrom earliest childhood, I knew Barker as a classy and professional game show host.  Over the years, I also learned that he (at the age of 103) was sleeping with his models, and that he could kick ass in a goofball comedy.  But the pricing games continued with comedy and grace as Bob's hair turned white and his hearing got worse.  More often than not, the bidding includes a scene like this:\r\n\r\n\"I'll bid twenty-one hundred Bob!\"\r\n  \r\n\"Twenty-three hundred\"\r\n  \r\nThe person operating the colored amount screens in front of the contestants puts up 2100.  Bob may or may not notice, but he will correct himself if he does.\r\n<table cellpadding=\"2\" align=\"right\">\r\n<tr>\r\n<td width=\"5\" rowspan=\"2\"><spacer type=\"block\" width=\"5\" height=\"1\"><\/td>\r\n<td width=\"250\" align=\"center\" ><img src=\"\/img\/benandbobbarker.jpg\" align=\"right\" width=\"375\"><\/td>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td class=\"caption\" width=\"250\">In the early 2000's I took a trip to Los Angeles.  This is one of the only photos that I took of myself at the Hollywood walk of fame.<\/td>\r\n\r\n<\/tr>\r\n<\/table>\r\nAnyway, Bob's last new episode aired June 15.  A million unspayed and unneutered pets wept.\r\n\r\nYou also know that they picked Drew Carey to replace Bob Barker.  I'm not super excited about that choice, but I'll give the guy a chance.  I thought that Dan Patrick was the choice when he quit ESPN, but alas, it wasn't to be.  I would have also liked to see Bob Eubanks or Wink Martindale, or one of those old guys from when they actually had game shows on during the day.\r\n\r\nThere is some recent precedent for stand up comedian turned star of bad sitcom turned game show host (Bob Saget, that guy with the \"You might be a redneck\" jokes whose name escapes me right now).  Their shows aren't too bad.\r\n\r\nBut they aren't <em>The Price is Right<\/em> either.\r\n\r\nWhile they're making changes, I hope they don't go too overboard with changes to the set.  There's no need for a complete overhaul like <em>The Tonight Show<\/em> did for Jay Leno.  Come to think of it, there was no need for that complete overhaul either.\r\n\r\nI do hope they'll up some of the hard-coded dollar amounts.  You know what the prize is if you spin exactly one dollar in the showcase showdown?  You got it -- $1000.  I'm sure that was a huge deal in 1964, but now, ehhh.  Also, I think you still have to be within $200 of your showcase in order to win both showcase packages.  That's like a 0.25% margin of error now.  Again, when the showcase packages were a few thousand, a $200 buffer was fair.  Now, it will never happen unless someone cheats.\r\n\r\nIf you've bothered reading this far, but you're still looking for a way to kill some more time, check <a href=\"http:\/\/gscentral.net\/pricing1.htm\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/gscentral.net\/pricing1.htm<\/a> for descriptions and pictures of every single pricing game that they've ever played.\r\n\r\n"

They will be posted as photos of the day intermittently through the rest of the summer.\r\n\r\nI didn't go through each and every photo in the bin, but I saw enough to know that there were a few themes.  For example, the group photos of the same ladies with some Las Vegas backdrop or other.  If I ever have enough time and inclination, I'm going to create a big panorama of Mrs. theskinnyonbenny, Crystal, Stacie, Lisa, and any additional hangers-on from the particular year, and we can all watch them age, year after year in front of yet another fountain, bar, blackjack table, or alley of decrepit winos.\r\n<!--more-->\r\nSimilarly, there's the annual (or more frequent in earlier years) picture of Eddie with shirt untucked, spillage everywhere, and eyes bugged out with drunkenness.

I find almost all of those pictures very funny, but keep them at home for the sake of household harmony.\r\n\r\nTo get the ball rolling, tomorrow's picture is one of me in a shower cap the weekend of a friend's wedding.  I think it was the late 90s, but I'm not certain.  I suspect I was jealous of how funny Stacie had been earlier (or the night before) as she wore the hotel room cap, danced, and sang a Superhero jingle about \"Showercap Girl.\"\r\n\r\nI'm not sure who I would have been talking to on the phone.  Also, the framing is awful.  It's generally good to keep a person's chin in the photograph when it is a photograph of that person's <em>face<\/em>.\r\n\r\nBy the way, I didn't find a picture of the actual Showercap Girl, so that's not one of the ones to anticipate."

I've been to Madison, and it is indeed a really cool town.  Like all great college towns, the university is huge, rabidly fanatical about football, and drives a huge bar scene.  The old part of Madison itself is a really cool little bohemian town featuring lots of cool little restaurants, bars, brew pubs, independent book stores, and cheese shops, without a nationally known chain in the area.  It's near a pretty state capital complex, and smooshed between two big lakes, bordered by parks, that are ideal for any kind of water recreation.\r\n\r\nI thought through this and had a quick momentarily panicked thought of, \"Shit, Madison might really be better than Baton Rouge.\"\r\n<!--more-->\r\nAnd then I remembered that they have colder nastier winters than I can imagine, let alone try to bear.  Average temps for Madison in April:  High 55, Low 33.  Our April is Madison's summer, and we're four to six weeks past when we busted out shorts and sandals.  Close the book on Madison.\r\n\r\nThe next city that was a real contender was Austin.  Oddly, all of the candidates are both college towns and state capitals.\r\n\r\nI was worried again.  Their bar\/restaurant scene is unparalleled.  I've never been to SXSW, but I know it's as big as New Orleans's Jazz Fest, but spread through the city and lasting the whole week, and that it's where great bands get discovered.  It might be the friendliest town for bicycling anywhere in the Central time zone, and there's a nearby lake for water sports.\r\n\r\nThe only drawback that comes right to mind is that it's in Texas.  In general, I'm anti-Texas.  It's too big and dry for my liking.  Too hot in the summer, and too cold in the winter.  And Texans who insist the moon revolves around earth only to catch a daily glimpse of the longhorn state are all too common and all too annoying.\r\n\r\nThere's a lot more to do in Baton Rouge then there was a few years ago.  There are lots of chances for free outdoor concerts, more and more bars open downtown, and food quality that can't be touched by any other city of similar size.  Just yesterday, I had a link of crawfish boudin from Tony's seafood for lunch.  It was incredibly flavorful -- there was a bit of smoky flavor from the grill which perfectly complimented the spicy seasoning.  Neither flavor drowned out the delicate -- almost sweet -- crawfish meat.  It was enough to get almost full, and it cost somewhere around a dollar.  \r\n\r\nBeat that.\r\n\r\nThe truth of the matter is that if you're going to visit a town for a couple of days, you are better off going to Madison (in the summer) or Austin.  If you're looking for the perfect college football experience, come tailgate with us outside of Tiger stadium.  You won't want to go to the game.\r\n\r\nAnd if you're looking for the best college town to spend a year, there's nowhere else close.  But you have to come and stay a little while in order to prove it to yourself.\r\n"

In other words, half the people who put their money on the line don't think the Saints will have a winning season, and the other half do.  I was expecting a line of around 9 1\/2.  Yes, the Saints have a tough schedule, given its championship-game non-division schedule.  Furthermore, the rest of the NFC South should be much improved.  But its hard for me to imagine a team with this much offensive power losing more than half of its games.  It almost seems like an easy-money sucker bet.\r\n<!--more-->\r\nDon't get me wrong.  The odds are staggeringly against the Saints making it to the NFC Championship game again.  The last decade of NFL is chock full of NFC teams that go to the championship or even to the Super Bowl, who don't even win their division the next season.  I'll leave the task of digging up specific examples to more serious researchers, but I seem to remember this being the case with Atlanta, Carolina, and Tampa Bay recently.  (What do you know!  All NFC South!)\r\n\r\nAs of today, I'll predict a 9-7 season and a wild-card spot in the playoffs.  Remember that this is my pick <i>today<\/i>.  As the season gets closer, I'll get more and more geeked, to the point of first game kickoff, when I'll be sure that the Saints will be 16-0, waltzing into the Superbowl, and winning the big game by 30 points or more.\r\n\r\nBut today, let's face reality.  Never in our lifetimes has there been a season like last, pairing LSU and Saints success so remarkably.  And it's not likely that we will ever see such a season again.\r\n\r\nWhich is one of the many reasons that I'm half expecting the Tigers to flop.\r\n\r\nThe preseason prognostications are good.  I've seen rankings from two to five in the country.  This reminds me of the summer of 1989.\r\n\r\nThat was the summer before I started my first semester at LSU.  Expectations were high.  LSU was ranked somewhere around 5 or 7 by The Sporting News, which back then was the only major summertime preview glossy.  The head coach complained that it wasn't high enough.\r\n\r\nThey ranked LSU's special teams as the best in the country.  We learned how much sports writers know when Texas A&M took the season's opening kickoff all the way back for a touchdown.  \r\n\r\nIt turned out that we didn't have much of a team that year.  Or the year after.  Or the year after.  The Mike Archer era turned into the Curley Hallman era, and then to the Gerry Dinardo era.  I was never a student during a season where LSU played a bowl game.\r\n\r\nI don't know if we're in for a decade-long dark era, but there is one more bad sign.  Mike the Tiger died.  And you can't just roll down to PetSmart and pick up a new tiger cub.  \r\n\r\nI don't know how one goes about getting a new tiger.  You have to find a zoo willing to give up a cub or willing to breed a couple for them.  And whoever breeds them is going to be stuck with the rest of the litter.  It's not like LSU wants three.  Or that they're going to find a lot of other people who want the left overs.\r\n\r\nI don't like LSU's chances of winning if there isn't a tiger in the cage come game time.  That's just my gut talking, but that's how I see it."

And HBO must know that they have a monopoly on those who are tired of reality shows, game shows, and American Idol ripoffs, because they aren't really putting much effort into providing a decent program.\r\n\r\nI direct this primarily at <i>John From Cincinnati<\/i>, the new show launched right after <em>The Sopranos<\/em> ended.  I watched the first episode, where they introduced a lot of odd characters and strange goings-on.  The second episode inc1\r\nincluded more strange goings-on, a lot of shouting by Rebecca De Mornay, the confirmation that Dylan from 90210 and Al Bundy are main characters, and was capped by the resurrection of a shttp:\/\/theskinnyonbenny.com\/blog2\/wp-admin\/post.php?action=edit&post=309\r\nBenâ€™s Web Log â€º Edit â€” WordPressurfer kid from the dead.  After that episode, I was optimistic that we had a weird-as-shit, but entertaining new show.\r\n\r\nBut then the writers decided, \"Now that we knew some characters, who needs things like plot or coherence?\"  They notched up the screaming and the weird, culminating (at least for me) with last night's hour of people yelling at each other for no reason at all, sprinkled with people saying sentences that were complete nonsense, presumably mysteries to be revealed later.\r\n<!--more-->\r\nThe word \"Lost\" appears often in the background or on props, and that's exactly where I am with this show.  And despite the fact that there's some comically bad acting and a worthwhile number of good looking cast members, \"lost\" is exactly what they have in this viewer.\r\n\r\nIf it gets any better, let me know.\r\n\r\nHBO's other current serial drama is <em>Big Love<\/em>, the story of a Utah man and his three wives, living in harmonious secret polygamy.  Perhaps one day I'll share my opinion on polygamy, run of the mill Mormons, and the fundamentalist Mormons but I would need more time and space than I'm going to allow myself for this post.  Jon Krakauer's book, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Under-Banner-Heaven-Jon-Krakauer\/dp\/0330419129\/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1\/105-6943743-4578005?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1184601586&sr=8-1\" target=\"_blank\">Under the Banner of Heaven<\/a> is a really good read on the subject.\r\n\r\nBack to television, HBO's comedies are much better.  <em>Entourage<\/em> is probably my favorite show that's on right now, although it isn't as good as it was last year.  The main reason is that they're focused more on the business of making movies than they are on floozies and parting, but it's still a really fun show to watch.\r\n\r\n<em>Flight of the Conchords<\/em> is a hilarious show in a completely different way.  The comedy is the dry, non-laughing, awkward sort that non-fans of <em>The Office<\/em> don't get.  It's pretty good, but not nearly as funny.  The part that's pure gold is the music videos that they break into mid-episode.

Our back yard is too small for a squeaky suburban back yard swing set, but we do have some areas with seating and roofing or arbor overhead.  It shouldn't be too much trouble to tie a bigger baby swing up so that he can go.\r\n\r\nWell, we looked all over town, and we could only come up with a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.toysrus.com\/product\/index.jsp?productId=2330640\" target=\"_blank\">twenty dollar piece of crap<\/a>, or a nice looking wooden kid's swing that was priced at a hundred dollars.\r\n\r\nNeither of these was what I was looking for.  So I decided to save money and build the swing myself.\r\n\r\nAt this point, I've spent about 2 hours shopping for lumber and hardware, about 12 hours in actual labor, plus $20 for the plans, $40 for lumber, $20 for screws, glue, nails, etc., and around $20 for a drill bit and a router bit that I needed for the construction.  And a little more for the chain to hang it, but I probably would have had to buy that anyway.  \r\n\r\nAnd I'm not finished.  All I have done is carved out all of the various pieces.  I still have to glue and screw them all into a swing.\r\n\r\nOn the up side, my swing is going to be a lot heavier and weather resistant than the expensive one that I passed on.  Plus, I'll have some of that glue left over.\r\n\r\nAlso, I've needed to use just about every power tool in my arsenal:\r\n\r\n<ul><li>Miter saw (cross cuts)<\/li>\r\n<li>Table saw (rip cuts)<\/li>\r\n<li>Sabre saw (curved cuts on the arm rests and a couple of other pieces)<\/li>\r\n<li>Sander<\/li>\r\n<li>Drill<\/li>\r\n<li>Dremmel tool with router attachment<\/li><\/ul>\r\n\r\nI should finish by the end of the week, so I'll post the completed swing as a picture of the day one day next week.\r\n\r\n"

So earlier this week, I opened a box of no-longer-fitting clothes that she sent me.\r\n\r\nOn top of the clothes, she had this stuffed rabbit.  I immediately exclaimed, \"Where the hell did Softy come from?\"\r\n\r\n<table cellpadding=\"2\" align=\"right\"><tr><td width=\"5\" rowspan=\"2\"><spacer type=\"block\" width=\"5\" height=\"1\"><\/td><td width=\"250\" align=\"center\" ><img src=\"\/img\/softy.jpg\" align=\"right\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td class=\"caption\" width=\"250\">A current photograph of Softy.<\/td><\/tr><\/table>\r\n\r\nSofty had been my toy as a kid.  He had a partner, whose name -- creatively enough -- was Hardy.  They were both rabbits, one with a soft forehead and one with a hard forehead.\r\n\r\nHardy and Softy were never main characters in the world of me and my stuffed animals.  They were Larry and Lana rather than Jack, Janet, or Chrissy.  And to be honest, if I had been asked to name my stuffed animals, I would have forgotten to list either of them.  Nevertheless, it's good to see Softy, and I feel bad for that case of the mange that he's obviously contracted since we were together last.\r\n\r\nHow Softy ended up with my grown sister in a house in a city that I've rarely visited and never lived near is anyone's guess.  And most of my stuffed animals' whereabouts are unknown.  I did a quick census.\r\n\r\n<b>Hardy, small white rabbit<\/b>:  destroyed by a (real) dog or cat many, many, many years ago.\r\n\r\n<b>Elephant whose name I forget<\/b>:  The stuffed elephant was really more of a throw pillow than a stuffed animal.  While Hardy and Softy were minor characters in our dramas, the elephant took no part at all.  He was a fake stuffed throw pillow even to my other stuffed animals.  His (because none of my stuffed animals were ever female) whereabouts are unknown.  But who cares?\r\n\r\n<b>Alpo, green dog with black ears<\/b>:  Alpo stayed with my grandparents while they were alive, and then he joined the rest of us wherever we were living at the time.  He was a good one.  Whereabouts also unknown.\r\n\r\n<b>Honkey, sock monkey<\/b>:  Honkey was second in seniority and was a part of any adventure that included stuffed animals.  Again, his current whereabouts are unknown.\r\n\r\n<b>A-a, bear<\/b>:  First, the pronunciation.  \"A-a\" is like the very first sound in the word \"ostrich,\" said very short and quickly, and repeated twice.  Try it out loud.\r\n\r\nA-a was my first stuffed animal, and perhaps my first toy at all.  I of course have no memory of the time before A-a.  He was my chief general and most common sidekick.  He looked like just a plain brown teddy bear.\r\n\r\nA-a was with us one summer in the early 1980s.  Our family was on vacation, rolling in an orange VW Van, with a camper top that popped up.  We were on our way from Indiana to the new resort destination of Myrtle Beach.  Somewhere in mid-South Carolina, we stopped for gas.  As we pulled out of the station, someone noticed black smoke coming from the rear of the vehicle.  We all jumped out and stood back at the gas station while the van and everything in it (including A-a) burnt to ashes.\r\n\r\n(Pause to wipe the tear from my eye.)\r\n\r\nWe were in the middle of nowhere, on a Sunday.  I'm pretty sure that it was even Father's Day.  Some nice old couple picked us up, drove us a million miles to the nearest airport, and helped us get on a plane home.  It was so long ago, I remember that they waited at the gate with us before we boarded the plane.\r\n\r\nIt's probably a good thing that A-a was taken in some sort of catastrophe, so I didn't reach the day -- years and years later -- where I had to decide whether he came to college with me or not.\r\n"

It just happens that there are two and only two hardware stores in town that I know will bother with a serrated blade.  One is close to my house, but it burned down last year and hasn't reopened.  So I made the longer drive to Highland Ace Hardware.\r\n\r\nFrom the front counter, I was directed to the machine shop window in the back right corner.  I walked back, and stood to the side of an old man who looked a lot like the elderly farmer guy (Eustace) in the \"Courage the Cowardly Dog\" cartoon.\r\n<!--more-->     \r\n<table cellpadding=\"2\" align=\"right\"><tr><td width=\"5\" rowspan=\"2\"><spacer type=\"block\" width=\"5\" height=\"1\"><\/td><td width=\"150\" align=\"center\" ><img src=\"\/img\/eustace.jpg\" aligh=\"right\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td class=\"caption\" width=\"150\">Eustace from Courage the Cowardly Dog.<\/td><\/tr><\/table>\r\n\r\nI daydreamed as Eustace tried to get the guy behind the window to understand what tube he needed for his lawn mower tire.  I thought the counter guy might be a friend or a relative, because he was so rude to Eustace.  No one would be that rude to a stranger.  Especially an old man.\r\n\r\nEustace was telling him, \"No, that one's too wide.  I need 16 inches, but only and inch and a half or two inches wide.\"\r\n\r\n\"You didn't look to get the measurements before you came in?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.  I know that it's sixteen by something around two inches though.  This one won't work.\"\r\n\r\n\"But we have HUNDREDS of them!  Would you go to the auto parts store and not know the make and model of your vehicle?\r\n\r\nThis is a poor analogy.  Not only did Eustace know the make and model of his lawn mower, but he knew one of the dimensions of his tube.  By the way, if those numbers don't make sense, give me some slack.  I've never owned a lawn mower, and didn't really know what they were talking about very well.\r\n\r\nCounter guy wandered to the back to try to find someone who might be able to talk some sense into Eustace.  Right as he did, Eustace noticed exactly what he wanted on the shelf next to him.  He picked up the last two boxes, asked if I would let counter guy know, and walked off.\r\n\r\nCounter guy came back a couple of minutes later, having realized or been told that the tubes were right there on the shelf, where Eustace had found them.  But despite being at least 45 years younger than Eustace, I couldn't immediately get him to realize that I wasn't the same guy.\r\n\r\n\"There was two boxes right there.  I know I saw them earlier.  They should be right there.\"\r\n\r\n\"Uh, yeah.  That guy found them.  He's good now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let me come around.  I'm sure they were right there.\"\r\n\r\n\"They <i>were<\/i> there.  That old guy found them when you were in the back.\"\r\n\r\n\"He left?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well shoot.  We had what he needed.  He didn't have to leave.\"\r\n\r\n\"He found them while you were in the back.  He didn't leave empty handed.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a pause where he began to understand.  And then rudely, \"so what do you want?\"\r\n\r\nI told him that I wanted to have my knife sharpened.  As I was opening it to show him the serrated blade, he said, \"Give it here, I'll go show Gene.\"  When I handed it over, he chastised me for handing it to him with the blade open but not locked in place.\r\n\r\nHe came back and said that Gene could do it, but not now, as he was occupied with a chain saw blade.  I would have to go to the front and have them write up a ticket.\r\n\r\nHe came around the counter to walk to the front with me, and he started to hand me the knife back.  Then he stopped himself, opened the blade, and handed it to me just like I had given it to him.\r\n\r\n\"Gene says it will take off some serration, but not much.  Just a red cunt hair's worth.\"  I noticed that he was missing a lot of teeth.\r\n\r\n\"Well that's okay.\"\r\n\r\nWhen I was almost to the counter, he said, \"maybe I shouldn't use that expression.  It might have offended you.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's okay, I'm familiar with 'cunt hair' as a unit of measurement.\"  Noting the color of the cunt hair is new to me, and I thought a rather nice touch.\r\n\r\nHe had me fill out my own order form, and by the time I had written down my name and phone number, he had forgotten about me altogether.\r\n"

Here are my thoughts.\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<center><img src=\"\/img\/books\/darkitaly.jpg\"><\/img><\/center>\r\n<!--more-->\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/search.barnesandnoble.com\/booksearch\/isbnInquiry.asp?z=y&EAN=9780865477247&itm=1\" target=\"_blank\">The Dark Heart of Italy<\/a>, by Tobias Jones\r\n\r\nHere's the crux of this book:  an Englishman moves to Italy, and then pens a book about how corrupt and backwards Italy is.  Sounds like it might be interesting, but it is really very very very far from interesting.  Unless you have some strangely acute interest in the nuances of politics of Italy, you will agree with me that this is a terrible fucking book.\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<center><br \/><br \/><img src=\"\/img\/books\/russka.jpg\"><\/img><\/center>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/search.barnesandnoble.com\/booksearch\/isbnInquiry.asp?z=y&EAN=9780865477247&itm=1\" target=\"_blank\">Russka<\/a>, by Edward Rutherfurd\r\n\r\nThis is a new type of book for me.  It tries to teach the reader a bit of Russian history, though information given in the course of a fictional narrative.  \r\n\r\nSome of my favorite novels have taught me a bit of history by accidentally including (or even possessing me to research) background history that's relevant to the story.  For example, everything I know about Europe's trade with China in the  1700's and 1800's came from looking up details about things alluded to in James Clavelle's novels.\r\n\r\nThis book is a little different, as its primary purpose was to educate.  The story isn't terrible, but one plot narrative can't possibly span the thousand years covered in this novel, even given its more than 900 page heft.  What you get instead is a series of short soap-operas, joined by generational ties and coincidence.\r\n\r\nThis isn't to say that it was bad.  It was a decent read.  And it certainly beat the hell out of trying to read Russian history directly.  So if you're interested in learning some Russian history, give it a whirl.  If you're looking for a good book, give it a pass.\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<center><br \/><br \/><img src=\"\/img\/books\/kafka.jpg\"><\/img><\/center>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/search.barnesandnoble.com\/booksearch\/isbnInquiry.asp?z=y&EAN=9781400079278&itm=1\" target=\"_blank\">Kafka on the Shore<\/a>, by Haruki Murakami\r\n\r\nThis is the second of Murakami's novels that I've read, and it seems to me that he might be the novel equivalent of the Coen brothers.  weird but good.  And this is indeed a weird-ass book.\r\n\r\nI don't know how to summarize this without typing a lot more text than anyone wants to read, but I'll give it a try.\r\n\r\nThere are two converging stories going on.  In one, a teenage runaway runs into odd characters and ends up in weird places.  He sometimes talks to a character that he either imagines or is some sort of spirit, and he has some odd episodes as he travels.\r\n\r\nThe other story is way more strange.  It involves a retarded man who has some special powers.  Presumably he got these powers as a child when he went from normal to retarded during a strange incident during World War II.  He ends up murdering someone who might be a real person or might be some sort of spirit, and this sets him off on a journey that he feels he has to take.\r\n\r\nAs I feared, this is a really crappy explanation  Bottom line: this is worth the short time that it takes to read.\r\n\r\nOne warning:  like the other Murakami book that I read, this one throws you a lot of mysterious things, and doesn't get around to explaining them all.  It's a little disappointing when it ends.  There are enough clues to let your mind make up a plausible explanation, but if you need the author to lay it all out nice and clean, you won't get it here.\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<center><br \/><br \/><img src=\"\/img\/books\/beanfield.jpg\"><\/img><\/center>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/search.barnesandnoble.com\/booksearch\/isbnInquiry.asp?z=y&EAN=9780805063745&itm=1\" target=\"_blank\">Milagro Beanfield War<\/a>, by John Nichols\r\n\r\nI've never read John Nicols before, and I'm actually not finished with this even though I started it on my trip.  But what great writing!  I can't remember a book where I read a paragraph and enjoyed it so much that I go back to the beginning and read it again.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>The old man coughed, scratched his balls, snagged a coffeepot with one arthritic paw, and shuffled over to the hand-dug well.  Letting the bucket drop slowly into the water thirty feet below, he only a quarter filled it, then slowly, resting after each tug, pulled the bucket up and tipped some water into the coffeepot, which he carried back and set atop the heater.\r\n\r\nNext, he proceeded cautiously around his dwelling to the backyard outhouse.  And while he camped there with door open so he could watch the turquoise-silver bluebirds flying about his crumbling farmhouse, he also slowly and shakily, though in the end expertly, rolled a cigarette and lit it, contentedly puffing away as he crapped.<\/blockquote>\r\n\r\nIsn't that great?\r\n\r\nThe dialog is entertaining too.\r\n\r\nThe story is of a renegade guy in a small town who plants a bean field, despite not having water rights.  But it's just a vehicle to move through a great assortment of tangential tales and eccentric characters.\r\n\r\nThis is an excellent book."

And that picture of the plug takes up more than its share of real estate on the excerpt that automatically gets written to the home page.  And I've been home for a week.  And I'm not working again.  So what's been up?\r\n<!--more-->\r\nI'd love to blame it entirely on new parenting duties.  And there has been a heck of a lot of visiting, doctors, food and pacifier shopping, and working on our vocabulary (mostly a sound like AAAHH!, a sentance that goes like baa-baa-baa-baa-baa-baa, a cheerful singsong GOI GOI GOI, and crying), and learning how to walk.\r\n\r\nBut in truth, there are a lot more boring things that are taking time.  Dog damage to my sprinkler system.  Failed plants in window boxes.  A complete lack of unspoiled food when we returned.  \r\n\r\n<table cellpadding=\"2\" align=\"right\"><tr><td width=\"5\" rowspan=\"2\"><spacer type=\"block\" width=\"5\" height=\"1\"><\/td><td width=\"250\" ><img src=\"\/img\/firstmate.jpg\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td class=\"caption\" width=\"250\">New ship's officer on his first sail.<\/td><\/tr><\/table>\r\n\r\nAnd three weeks of television season finales to catch up on by DVR.  What can I say about the Sopranos ending in an unexplainable blackout that hasn't been covered already?\r\n\r\nSo for the rest of the summer, my goal is two posts a week, plus a reasonably consistent picture of the day.  Plus, I have a couple of new pages that I've been meaning to do that I'm going to try to complete this summer.\r\n\r\nTo imitate <a href=\"http:\/\/princesssparklepants.blogspot.com\/>my sister's blog<\/a>, I'll take a moment to complain about my health.  I've had the Raspy Russian Crud (true medical designation) in my lungs for the better part of the last month, and it's keeping me from something that I've been looking forward to for a while:  singing my work email to music.  I know.  That reads like it's going to be quite a waste of time, but just you wait.\r\n\r\nWe took my new first mate sailing on Sunday.  He slept on the cabin floor while we had a rough sail in 15 knot wind and heavy chop.  He seemed to enjoy it while he was awake, though.\r\n\r\n"

I knew it to be the work of the cleaning lady, and I snapped this picture thinking that I would write a post about it.\r\n<!--more-->\r\nMy thought was that the bulk of the post would be about this time as a teenager on the job, I grabbed a cord of something or other, and pulled to take the plug out of the wall.  My boss (and parents' good friend) Karl Hartman went moderately ape shit, getting all red in the face and lecturing for a number of minutes about how you can ruin a cord altogether, and how it increases your risk of electrocution or fire.\r\n\r\nBut that's the sum of everything I had to say on the topic, so my post went no further.\r\n\r\n(The one and only interesting fact about Karl is that when my parents would get together with their friends, he would drink for a while, and at some point, he would lie down on the floor and close his eyes.  Just when you thought he was passed out, he would chime in with his opinion or answer to whatever was being discussed, and you would realize that he was listening the whole time.  Perhaps he hadn't even drank that much.  This happened time and again.)\r\n\r\nWell, the day before we <a href=\"\/adop\/\">left for Russia<\/a>, Mrs. theskinnyonbenny and I were scurrying around the house like mice.  Our Passports with new Russian visas showed up in the mail, we got a last piece of paperwork notarized and apostilled, oversaw the completion of having our house painted (there's a story for another day), and finished some things around the house.  Meanwhile, the cleaning lady was finishing the laundry (so that Continental\/Aeroflot could lose a bunch of my CLEAN clothes), and doing some light cleaning around the house.\r\n\r\nI got called into the house to repair the vacuum cleaner.  It wouldn't turn on.  I checked the outlets and breaker box.  I flipped the power switch on and off about seven times, and I checked the cord and the hidden compartments of the vacuum cleaner for a circuit breaker that I could reset.  I noticed that the prong was bent.\r\n\r\nSure enough, old Karl Hartman was right.  Pulling the plug out of the outlet by its end really does ruin a power cord.  Mrs. theskinnyonbenny ran down to her secret land of vacuum cleaners and had the cord replaced right away.\r\n\r\nNeedless to say, she was quite surprised that I had gathered months-old evidence about how the cord came to be broken."

This isn't true, but it's a complaint that she likes to fall back on when we hit a Friday or Saturday night with nothing to do.\r\n\r\nThe weekend before we left for Russia (two weekends ago, now) was especially busy.  Not with getting ready to travel, but with stuff that we were invited to do.\r\n<!--more-->\r\nOn the previous Friday, we had talked to our friend Elton at a crawfish boil.  He was excited to see Kings of Leon play at the house of Blues next Friday, but didn't know anyone who wanted to go with him.  Mrs. theskinnyonbenny mixed up Kings of Leon with someone else, and proclaimed that I was a big fan, and sure -- we're in.\r\n\r\nI knew of KOL, but for some reason, my mind had them filed with the sea of indistinguishable generic alt-rock bands.  Right on in there with Good Charlotte and anyone who's ever been on an American Pie soundtrack.  \r\n\r\nBut then I spent the week listening to their CDs, and I was oh so wrong.  Somehow, I missed that KOL is a really, really good band.  I got pretty excited about it, and then enjoyed the show.  Several times in the past couple of weeks, I've been on shuffle and thought to myself, \"Hey that's a cool tune that I don't recognize.\"  Looking down, it's the Kings.\r\n\r\nElton thought that the live show was better than the album performances.  Both were good, but I think the production quality of the albums makes them better.  They didn't over-do it.  You can hear the singer's voice break, the squeak of fingers on guitar strings, and they don't edit that out.  The albums are very good.  \r\n\r\nI didn't catch any of that in the live show.  It was rehearsed, polished, still good, but different.\r\n\r\n<center><img src=\"\/img\/greenline.gif\"><\/center>\r\n\r\nOn Saturday that same weekend, we went to Eddie's for boiled crabs.  I don't know where Ed got this particular catch, but they were huge, and he boiled them to perfection.  We smashed them open and got piles and piles of sweet moist crab meat.  Its perfect flavor spread over the entire mouth and melted away with a hint of spiciness.  Oh, so good.\r\n\r\nEddie had tried to get me to boil them at my house, but I ignored his hints, since I planned to be too busy on Sunday to wash boil pots and throw away old beer bottles.  So he bucked up and boiled them himself.\r\n\r\nOnce he had a couple of beers, Eddie warned me not to make fun of him on my web site.  The light bulb went off:  PEOPLE DON'T INVITE US OVER BECAUSE THEY THINK I'LL MAKE FUN OF THEM ON THE INTERNET!\r\n\r\n(Not untrue, unfortunately.)\r\n\r\nMrs. theskinnyonbenny suggested that I make fun of faux-friends named Freddie and Marmel instead, but to be honest, there's nothing to ridicule.\r\n\r\nOnce Mrs. theskinnyonbenny and Freddie had a little too much to drink, they argued about which of them was more awesome.  I had a really good idea:  an awesome contest.  Some weekend soon, we'll get together, drink a little too much, and then each of them will have ten minutes to convince the rest of us that he or she is the more awesome.  Then, the other person gets ten minutes to present his or her side.  They can make a speech, sing, dance, or do whatever awesome power moves that they think will be convincing.  Winner by vote will be deemed the more awesome.\r\n\r\n<center><img src=\"\/img\/greenline.gif\"><\/center>\r\n\r\nWe got up early Sunday and finished some yard work that wouldn't wait until after our trip.  Around lunch time, we threw the dogs in the Jeep, and started driving toward Gange and Pop-pop's house, where they would be living for the next three and a half weeks.\r\n\r\nWe needed to just drop them off and head back to Baton Rouge to buy some books and start packing, but my folks had just bought a new boat.  So we were forced to wait out a thunderstorm and then go for a half-hour spin crashing through the lake chop on their 19-foot speedboat.  Fun fun fun.  I'm very excited to have it around this summer.\r\n\r\n"

There were some pictures of the little cat (Pete, his name turns out to be) doing cat-like things, but there were also some of the cat \r\nin places of local interest.  For example, there's one of the cat sitting on the statue in Jackson Square.\r\n\r\nThere are also some where the cat is added in take-offs of more famous art.  There's the cat stretching his paw to meet God's hand on his take of the Sistine Chapel ceiling.  There's MC Escher drawing himself in the reflective ball with Pete on a chair in the background.\r\n<!--more-->\r\n<table cellpadding=\"2\" align=\"right\"><tr><td width=\"5\" rowspan=\"2\"><spacer type=\"block\" width=\"5\" height=\"1\"><\/td><td width=\"250\" ><img src=\"\/img\/pete_miscalc.jpg\" width=\"370\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td class=\"caption\" width=\"250\">My old gray friend Oscar did this to our armior many years ago (when it was new).<\/td><\/tr><\/table>\r\n\r\nI'm writing this post while without internet access (odd, I know), and I don't remember the guy's name.  But he was a super-nice guy, and interesting to boot.  He looks the part of \"hippie who never left the 70s,\" but he's actually a retired electrical engineer.  Educated at Auburn, so probably not a very good electrical engineer (I'm an EE grad from LSU, you know), but one of us nevertheless.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"petethecat.com\" target=\"_blank\">His web site<\/a> has some of the good ones, but the pictures posted there aren't comprehensive.  We bought the three prints that I have posted here to put up in Ivan's room.  I know that the one titled \"miscalculation\" wasn't on his web site, and I think it's my favorite of all.  What cat's human hasn't had a similar scene?  \r\n\r\n(Ahh, there's the guy's name, right there on the image.  I could correct the paragraph above, but I kind of like how it reads.)\r\n\r\nAnother one that I liked was pictured with an article that he had printed copies of from an Alabama magazine.  It had the cat on top of Bear Bryant's houndstooth hat, on his head, on the sideline of a football game.\r\n\r\n<table cellpadding=\"2\" align=\"left\"><tr><td width=\"250\" ><img src=\"\/img\/pete_streetcar.jpg\"><\/td><td width=\"5\" rowspan=\"2\"><spacer type=\"block\" width=\"5\" height=\"1\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td class=\"caption\" width=\"250\">Pete the Cat rides a streetcar (through the countryside, it appears).<\/td><\/tr><\/table>\r\n\r\nIf the perspective of the photographs of the prints looks a bit off, it's because they're hung on slanted walls.  In the upstairs of our house, the walls rise straight up to about waist height, and then they slope up and in to follow the roof line the rest of the way up.  If you have trouble picturing this, think of trying to hang pictures on the sloped wall in your attic.\r\n\r\nThe first problem you will find is that the weight of the picture pulls picture hangers right out of the sheet rock.  Normal picture hangers are no good at all.\r\n\r\nThey make a different kind of hanger that has a plastic hook attached to a sheet rock anchor.  The anchor screws into the sheet rock, leaving you a huge and ugly hole if you miscalculate, but giving you a firm hold.  So that solves the first problem.\r\n\r\nThe second problem that you encounter is that the picture wants to dangle downward.  I tried moving the wire up, thinking that the top wouldn't have room to swing up, and the stiffness of the picture would keep it from dangling down.  No dice.\r\n\r\nI tried the middle of the picture, thinking that if balanced better, I wouldn't have this problem.  Again, that failed to solve me problem.\r\n\r\nThe problem with these is that it's impossible to pull the wire on the back of the picture tight enough.  You start to pull the eye rings out of the frame before you get it tight enough to stay taught.  Even if you bonded the eye rings so that they magically weren't a problem, arm strength alone doesn't take out enough slack to keep the wire taut.\r\n\r\n<table cellpadding=\"2\" align=\"right\"><tr><td width=\"5\" rowspan=\"2\"><spacer type=\"block\" width=\"5\" height=\"1\"><\/td><td width=\"250\" ><img src=\"\/img\/pete_beatle.jpg\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td class=\"caption\" width=\"250\">Pete drives a Beatle, like Mrs. theskinnyonbenny used to.<\/td><\/tr><\/table>\r\n\r\nI was about ready to surrender.  I had started thinking of building brackets out of wood or molding, attached to the wall in a way where I could slide the picture down into the bracket.  The bracket would hold the bottom and sides of the picture firmly.\r\n\r\nBut Mrs. theskinnyonbenny had me try one more approach before giving in, and it proved to be the winner.  We put two wires across the back of each picture -- one high, and one low.  Then, we put four brackets -- one near the frame's edge for each of the sides and for each of the two wires.  Then, we hung the picture carefully so that all four hangers have hold of a little piece of wire.\r\n\r\nObviously, the problem here is the little room for error.  If we put up our four hangers and they weren't spaced right, or if we didn't have them square, we had to move them around.  We had the potential for putting a whole lot of big ugly holes in the wall.\r\n\r\nSomehow, we did pretty good.  I'll go ahead and say Ivan's bedroom suite is the nicest room in the house.  But I'm sure we'll lose that opinion once he gets everything covered in crayon, stickers, jelly, and dried up play-dough."

They had a show of 80s pop music where Martha Quinn would pop in every couple of songs and give us quirky little anecdotes.\r\n\r\nThen on Wednesday night, I was driving home from an evening sail -- several hours later than my Saturday drive -- and I found that I was listening to the same show on almost the exact same spot on the interstate.\r\n\r\nThis made the drive go by rather quickly as I could play a game where I try to remember what the next song would be, based on my surroundings.  I wasn't really very good at this game, but I did remember that she was going to relate some news story about baked beans as I exited the interstate, followed by a transition into \"Mexican Radio.\"\r\n<!--more-->\r\n<table cellpadding=\"2\" align=\"right\"><tr><td width=\"5\" rowspan=\"2\"><spacer type=\"block\" width=\"5\" height=\"1\"><\/td><td width=\"250\" ><img src=\"\/img\/marthaquinn.jpg\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td class=\"caption\" width=\"250\">A shot of Martha back in the day.<\/td><\/tr><\/table>\r\n\r\nThe double dose of Martha got me thinking.  She was just cutting her teeth when she got her early-80s gig at MTV, and she must have thought that she was on a much different career path.  She probably though that if MTV lasted at all, it would be a seldom-watched niche channel.  I'm sure she hoped for a call up to something more established and mainstream, like perhaps the Weather Channel. From there, she thought she might catch on as a correspondent for a <i>Good Morning America<\/i> type of light news show, followed years later by a chance to be a real journalist.\r\n\r\nInstead, she became a familiar voice to millions of teenagers, disappeared for a decade, and is now a familiar and nostalgic voice for those same teenagers-turned-30-something spenders.  She gets paraded out by satellite radio to prove that they have 80s-rock chops, and paraded on the occasional commercial for products meant to help women remember their youths.\r\n\r\nSo I wonder if this is disappointing to her.  Is she like the doctor who can't land a decent residency and ends up specializing in podiatry?  Is she like the dozens of astronauts who keep in shape and talk to elementary school students without ever getting a chance to go into space?\r\n\r\nOr is this what she was shooting for all along?  I mean, she does just play music for a living.  There can't be a bit of stress, and because she's a recognized name, she's making at least moderately decent denero for what she does.\r\n\r\nIf any of you are friends with Martha, have her drop me a note and let me know.\r\n\r\nThese are the types of things that my brain uses energy on.\r\n\r\n\r\n(Footnote:  The geographically astute of you will have caught that Jazz Fest is in New Orleans and that my boat is in Slidell, and you will further realize that different interstates connect these cities to Baton Rouge, and that therefore my statement in the second paragraph, 'the exact same spot on the interstate' must be rubbish.  However, from Jazz Fest, we went to catch an early dinner at Midendorf's in Manchac, so we ended up on I-12 into Baton Rouge from there.)"

I got home around 6:00, which is super-late for a Friday, but then we grilled steaks with a few others.  That seemed like the Friday night activity.\r\n\r\nAfter that, we walked around the corner to a neighbor's crawfish boil.  It was a different group with different conversation, so it feels like that happened a different day.  Two nights worth of socializing, and we were still home and in bed before midnight.\r\n<!--more-->\r\nWe went down to New Orleans for Jazz Fest on Saturday.  There must have been a zillion people there, many of whom appeared to be out-of-towners.  I have to conclude that the tourist influx for Jazz Fest is as high as it ever was.  As always, it was sunny and hot, but there was at least a bit of a breeze.  As always, we saw good music from previously-unheard of artists.  As always, paid way too much for beer and ate good food.\r\n\r\nI did manage the whole day without using a portable toilet.  I think I sweated the liquids out as fast as I took them in, so my real superpower was the ability to hold my #2 until I got all the way home.  This was especially impressive, as my body first reminded me that it was time for my morning elimination while walking toward the fairgrounds.  Every hour or so it reminded me, \"Hey, don't forget that you need to poop,\" but they were polite reminders rather than the angry explosive demands that the tail-end of my gastronomical system can sometimes make.\r\n\r\nMy favorite show was Stephen Marley, who by sound could have been his old man Bob.  He looked the part as well -- or at least the tiny spec of a guy I could see on stage was a black guy with long dreadlocks.  That's about as much detail as I could honestly give.\r\n\r\nMarley is also on the lineup for the Lollapalooza show in Chicago this summer.  Have you seen their <a href=\"http:\/\/www.lollapalooza.com\/lineup\/Lolla_Static_Lineup_Page.pdf\">lineup for this year<\/a>?  It's just fantastic.  There are 10 or 11 acts that I would love to see.  If I were in charge of putting together the lineup with an unlimited budget, I don't think I could have done better.  (Okay, G. Love and Special Sauce is at least 10 years late, but the rest of the lineup kicks ass.)\r\n\r\nThe people-watching was an absolute highlight.  Where else can one see such a collection of ugly people, beautiful people, freaks, the insane, wild costumes, and include everyone from babies to geezers the age of Methuselah?\r\n\r\nThe headliner Saturday night was John Mayer, but we didn't stay that long.  The full day of sun and alcohol is draining, but we were planning to go see Deacon John in the soul tent during the night performance anyway.\r\n\r\nMy body is indeed a wonderland, but I don't need John telling me so to know that it's true.\r\n\r\nSpent Sunday on errands and chores.  Nothing special there.\r\n"

I bought all of their studio albums over the years, but I didn't pick up the live album with mostly the same songs.  Which means that I missed this masterpiece.\r\n<!--more-->\r\nIf your computer, browser, and corporate network policy allow you to listen to this, go ahead and give it a go.

Your browser does not support plug-ins for digital video.<\/noembed>\r\n\r\nThe last line kills me.  Takes this from a song that I really enjoy to a masterpiece.\r\n\r\nMy favorite story about the sentiment expressed in that last line is this one.\r\n\r\nScene:  a beautiful night, late spring or early summer.  We are at an event center in Baton Rouge with chairs set up outside and tables, chairs, and dance floor at the ready inside.  Everything is decorated perfectly.  Jared and Yvette's wedding proceeds in the makeshift outdoor theater without a hitch.  \r\n\r\nAfter the ceremony, I was standing outside, sipping my first drink, and bullshitting with some of our other friends.  I finished my first drink at the same time as Marcel, and followed him inside and up to the bar.\r\n\r\nAs we got to the bartender, Eddie walked up to get a refill.  It seems like we were only 15-20 minutes into the reception, but somehow, Eddie was already tanked.  He was the only drunk person in the room that early, and he spoke very loudly.\r\n\r\n\"HEY MARCEL!  HOW'S YOUR MOM?\"\r\n\r\nA group of really old relatives turned to stare from a nearby table.  One old man looked exactly like Wilfred Brimley.  I found out later that he was a preacher or deacon or some such thing.\r\n\r\nMarcel was suspicious of the question, but still managed to answer.  \"Uuhhh, she's okay.  Why?\"\r\n\r\nWithout a pause, \"BECUASE SHE WAS PRETTY SORE AFTER THE FUCKIN' I SLAPPED ON HER LAST NIGHT!\"\r\n\r\nThe old people reacted similarly to the old people dining near Rodney Dangerfield during the dinner in <i>Caddyshack<\/i>.  I was handed my new drink right about that time, and I fled the scene, hoping to be spared if anyone was going to be asked to leave.\r\n\r\nBut I have been laughing at that line ever since.\r\n\r\n"

I won't get too sentimental, but we have great friends, none of whom has ever received a Christmas card from us.\r\n\r\n(Except for Crystal and Brent.  Crystal always used to bitch and bitch about sending us a card and not getting one in return.  So I would take the pre-prented card that we got every year from the president of my company, and without opening it, I would scribble out our name and address, put their address in its place, re-stamp it, and drop it in the mail.  Perhaps I would write who it was from on the back of the envelope, lest they think some stranger named Steve Uffman sent them a card in a scribbled out envelope by mistake.)\r\n<!--more-->\r\nOf all of the messages that I received, this was perhaps the most surprising:\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\nThat's quite a cat that you let out of the bag on theskinnyonbenny.com!  I picked a fine year to give up the internet for Lent (really - except for work duties).  Should have given up sniffing glue, I guess.\r\n<\/blockquote>\r\n\r\nGiving up the internet?  Could that really be true?  I dare say that this news was more a surprise to me than my news was to Tim.  I could sacrifice things for a million years, but I would never have thought to include the internet.\r\n\r\nBetter the internet than chocolate chip cookies, I suppose.\r\n\r\nCoincidentally, Mrs. theskinnyonbenny and I were recently talking about how inconvenient it must be for pregnant women to give up drinking.  This isn't going to sound like I intend it to, but we drink quite a bit.  But we don't need AA.  We don't get drunk every day or every week or even every month, but I drink a beer or a glass of wine while I cook.  We might sit outside on the patio and drink after work in the evening.  When we gather with our frinds, we have drinks.  So to give up alcohol altogether for nine months would be a bit of a strain.  \r\n\r\nThe first month or two might be okay.  But sooner or later, you'll be somewhere where everyone cuts loose.  On top of being the only sober one, your clothes don't fit right, you're roasting from the summer heat, and your feet look like baseball mits.  By then, all of the happy-go-lucky drinkers would be on your last damned nerve.\r\n\r\nI have a close friend who just let us in on the news that she's expecting.  Happy times!  (Note to the annoyed:  at least when your husband is drunk as a skunk this hot, sober summer, he'll be just as likely to be agressivly fondling his good buddy Benny as annoying you.)\r\n\r\nThere was a spring semester in college where one of the guys we hung around with bet my buddy Eddie a good amount of money for poor college boys that he couldn't go a month without drinking.  I don't remember who the other gambler was, exactly, but it's not important to the story.  I think it might have been the guy who grew up to be Morris Bart's errand boy.  \r\n\r\nEddie insisted that he definitely could go a full month without a drink.  I didn't want the bet to take place.  Drunk partners-in-crime weren't exactly hard to come by in our world, but Eddie was certainly my most frequent co-conspirator.  Besides, I didn't want him to miss out on all of the fun.  And honestly, I didn't think he had a chance.\r\n\r\nAlas, he took the bet.  Over the next set of weeks, he came to parties, went to bars, hung out after class, and never touched a drop of alcohol.  It got to day 30 of the 31 day month, and a group of us went to the bar called Ernie's.  We were having a good time while Eddie stood around with his coke or water, knowing that he was just 12 hours or so from winning his bet.\r\n\r\nThen, he blew it.  He couldn't take one more night of missing out on our hooliganism, and he figured that he had already proved the point that he \"could\" go for the month.  Hell, if it had been a 30-day month, he would have won the bet outright.\r\n\r\nThe next day, he paid the winner of the bet, and didn't regret the decision at all.\r\n\r\n(I am such a jackass.  See if you can get a count of all of the friends that I made fun of in the course of this post.  Glad I got those kind wishes when I did.  I should be down to zero friends by August.)\r\n\r\nNow, I'm going to go pour a drink.\r\n\r\n"

The sender is a stranger to me.  You don't have to read the whole thing, but go deep enough to get the gist.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Hello -\r\n\r\nIn an ongoing effort to ensure all members of Professional Services have a means of submitting suggestions regarding process improvements (PI) and strategic initiatives (SI), the Shared Services team recently assessed the existing submission process and enhanced it based on the addition of Stategic [sic] Initiatives and the results of the recent reorganization in terms of roles and responsibilities.\r\n\r\nBeginning today, ALL requests for process improvements and \/ or strategic initiatives should be submitted by completing the process below:\r\n\r\nStep 1:  Access and complete the PI \/ SI submission form\r\n\r\n        For your convenience, you can locate the form in one of two places:\r\n\r\n                        For those of you with DocuShare access, the form is placed in the ET - ET Professional Services - ET Shared Services folder (link included below)\r\n\r\n                      http:\/\/172.18.199.57:8080\/docushare\/dsweb\/View\/Collection-1105\/Document-6273\r\n\r\n                        For those of you without DocuShare access, please save the form below in your personal files and access it directly, as needed. \r\n\r\n              <<ET_PS_Process Improvement_Strategic Initiatives Submission Form_v2.doc>>\r\n\r\n              NOTES:\r\n\r\n              1) If you have DocuShare access please use the version posted in DocuShare to ensure you're always submitting the latest version.\r\n\r\n              2) When completing the form, you MUST complete all the REQUIRED fields for your request to be reviewed and considered.  If you do not provide all       the required information, your request will not be considered until all required data is obtained.\r\n\r\nStep 2:  Save the completed submission form in your personal files\r\n\r\n        NOTE: Please do NOT save your completed forms to DocuShare\r\n\r\nStep 3:  Email the completed form to Enabling Technologies SEPG\r\n\r\n        NOTE: Once the email is sent, a member of Shared Services will review the request and properly align it as A) Process Improvement, B) Strategic                 Initiative or C) Neither\r\n\r\nFor additional information regarding the history of this initiative and details regarding the individual PI \/ SI process flow, please reference the presentation reviewed with Professional Services Leadership and the ATL CFT Directors.<\/blockquote>\r\n\r\nIt was also full of bold text, red text, and odd indentations that weren't preserved with my copy and paste into this post.\r\n\r\nI haven't found the time yet, but I'm going to go through this whole routine to suggest a particular process improvement.  My suggestion:  don't make employess go through a complicated, unmemorizable, formal process just to suggest ways that things could be done better.\r\n\r\nI'll let you all know if that gets me fired.\r\n\r\n<center><img src=\"\/img\/greenline.gif\" \/><\/center>\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of acronyms in that email above, but fear not for me.  I also received recently a six-page glossary of acronyms, with probably 20 to 25 listings per page.  I haven't had a chance to go through them all, but here's one that jumped out at me:\r\n\r\n<table width=\"100%\"><tr><td>GORILLA<\/td><td>Gosh Offline Really Is Lots Less Aggravating (batch update process for ACRO)<\/td><\/tr><\/table>\r\n\r\nHowever, my glossary didn't have PI or SI or PI\/SI,  but the email author defines those at the top, so I think it's her intention to add to our lexicon of acronyms.  It doesn't have SPEG, which I still don't know.  It doesn't have ATL (the city of Atlanta, borrowed from the airport system -- a reference to headquarters) or CFT (customer focused team), which I happen to know from their frequent use.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone else work with people who aren't nearly as smart as they think they are?\r\n"

I would advise you to skip the rest of this post and check back later in the week.\r\n<!--more-->\r\nHere's what I've been up to:\r\n\r\nI spent most of the day Sunday assembling baby stuff.\r\n\r\nSaturday was like a tiring day of Christmas season, but without the requisite music or decorations.  Having absolutely nothing for the kid, we went store to store to store in the cloudy cold weather to stock up on all the things that you need.  After collapsing from exhaustion, we drove an hour and a half to eat dinner with my family, play a game of trivial pursuit, and drive back home.\r\n\r\n(I guess there was one funny part, from trivial pursuit.  The question was something like, \"Who wrote _______,\" with a quote that had something to do with racial supremacy.  After a minute or so of discussion, my mom pulled \"That guy in Germany,\" and Mrs. theskinnyonbenny was able to take that thought and come up with the name of Adolph Hitler.)\r\n\r\nOn Friday, I waited during the prescribed appointment time for a Sears service rep.  When the four-hour block proved to be not a big enough window, I called Sears to find out when I might expect my service.  I had an excruciatingly long and painful call where I had to give my phone number to three people after entering it in the keypad.  Then, they told me to be patient and that the dispatcher would call me back WHEN HE GOT BACK FROM LUNCH.  In truth, it was much worse than just this single slight, but I can't bear to relive it in any more detail.\r\n\r\nOther bits of frustration:\r\n\r\n<table cellpadding=\"2\" align=\"right\"><tr><td width=\"5\" rowspan=\"2\"><spacer type=\"block\" width=\"5\" height=\"1\"><\/td><td width=\"250\" ><img src=\"\/img\/upstracking.jpg\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td class=\"caption\" width=\"250\">Tracking information from UPS for my centerboard.<\/td><\/tr><\/table>\r\n\r\nUPS lost the centerboard to my boat.  This is a large, heavy piece of fiberglass that fits just into a particular slot on newer Rhodes 22 sailboats.  This part is useful only for this particular sailboat, and only for ones that have the newer diamond board configuration.  There are probably less than 100 boats who could possibly use this board, and probably only one in the world where the part is needed now.  I would love to find who ended up with my centerboard and see what they're doing with it.\r\n\r\nStanley Steamer sent a guy out to clean the grout on our kitchen counters and bathroom floors last week.  Because he had forgotten his grout tool, he guy used a furniture tool on the counters, and it marred the tile with big lines.  So he came back with some sort of solvent, which seems to have not only removed the lines, but also the glossy finish on the tile.  This story is still ongoing, but I'm doubtful that they can fashion a repair.\r\n\r\nThis cleaner was the same guy who removed the heater register from the floor in the bathroom, cleared his mind, and then stepped right down into it.  He knocked the vent clean down under the house.  The air and heat guy beat him to our house the next day, and being back and forth under the house and in the bathroom, he tracked in some dirt.  Stanley the knucklehead got to our house later and began sealing this dirt into the tile.\r\n\r\n"

Meanwhile, I darted across town to the doctor's office and back almost every day, trying to get my physical completed for the Russians.\r\n\r\nAll that really sucked.  But this week looks to be much improved.\r\n"

Confirmation that it was indeed Chuck came on the results show as they interviewed random audience members about who they thought would stay and who they thought would go.  I don't think they ever acknowledged on the broadcast that it was Chuck.  It was just a wink to us <i>Love Connection<\/i> fans.\r\n\r\nI got to wondering about how Chuck ended up in the audience.  Here in Baton Rouge, we have our redneck bars, college bars, yuppie bars, and bars for people who deny that they're yuppies, even though they really are.  It's not such a stretch to think that Southern California adds plastic surgeon bars, movie star bars, and TV show host bars to the mix.\r\n<!--more-->\r\n<table cellpadding=\"2\" align=\"right\"><tr><td width=\"5\" rowspan=\"2\"><spacer type=\"block\" width=\"5\" height=\"1\"><\/td><td width=\"250\" ><img src=\"\/img\/chuckwoolery.jpg\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td class=\"caption\" width=\"250\">Chuck Woolery -- because some of you were asking, \"Who's Chuck Woolery?\"<\/td><\/tr><\/table>\r\n\r\nI like to think that it played out something like this.  Chuck Woolery, Tom Bergeron, Ryan Seacrest, and Richard Dawson are sitting at the bar....\r\n\r\n<strong>Ryan:<\/strong>  So, any of you guys want some free <i>Idol<\/i> tickets?  I can set you up.\r\n\r\n<strong>Chuck:<\/strong>  Heck no.  I went to a taping of <em>The Match Game<\/em> in 1979, and it took three hours to come up with a half-hour show.  Most boring day of my life.\r\n\r\n<strong>Ryan:<\/strong>  Yeah, but we don't tape...\r\n\r\n<strong>Chuck <\/strong>(interrupting):  Now you should have seen how we did <i>Love Connection<\/i>.  Taped 10 shows in a half day!  That was a program.  It miffs me that it doesn't get the run that it deserves.  If it weren't for <i>Love Connection<\/i>, we would have no reality television to this day!\r\n\r\n<strong>Ryan:<\/strong> Another round please.\r\n\r\n<strong>Tom:<\/strong>  That's about enough, Ryan.  You've had three fuzzy navels already.  \r\n\r\n<strong>Ryan:<\/strong>  I'm a big boy Tom.  I can handle my liquor.\r\n\r\n<strong>Tom:<\/strong>  Anyway, if you guys aren't interested in <i>Idol<\/i>, I have a few tickets for Monday's <i>Dancing<\/i>.\r\n\r\n<strong>Tom:<\/strong>  Anyone? ... Anyone?\r\n\r\n<strong>Tom:<\/strong>  C'mon Chuck.  I went to watch you tape <i>Lingo<\/i>.  I bet there's not another person in the world who will admit to remembering that show.\r\n\r\n<strong>Chuck:<\/strong> How about <i>America's Funniest Home Videos<\/i>?\r\n\r\n<strong>Tom:<\/strong>  Hell, I couldn't even get tickets to that for my own mother.  It's <i>Dancing With the Stars<\/i>.  You owe me.\r\n\r\n<strong>Chuck:<\/strong>  Well, alriiiight.\r\n\r\n<strong>Richard:<\/strong>  So do any of you guys think Bob Barker is still banging those hot chicks on his show, or is his noodle permanently overcooked by now?\r\n\r\nI don't remember if I mentioned it, but I judged a Social Studies fair at a nearby school a couple of months ago.  One of the exhibits that I judged was about the <i>Hollywood Squares<\/i> game show.  I didn't know it before hand, but Tom Bergeron was one of the host of that show in one of its incarnations.  In her presentation, the girl told me that he went on to become the host of <i>America's Funniest Home Videos<\/i>.\r\n\r\nI asked if she knew what other show he hosts now.  She didn't.\r\n\r\nThe girl totally mailed in her project.  She got on IMDB, dug up some facts, and threw together a tick-tac-toe board on a piece of posterboard.  But you know that in her mind, she thinks, \"I didn't win just because I didn't know what other show Tom Bergeron was on.\"\r\n\r\nThe other reality note that amuses me from this week is the whole thing where Howard Stern has his followers calling in for Sanjaya -- who I haven't seem, but who seems to have universal agreement that he's the worst contestant by a country mile.\r\n\r\nThis intrigues me that I might just join the flock of voters.  They might be a strong enough block to push this guy all the way.  It would make a complete mockery of the show.  It might even kill the show.\r\n\r\nI would love to see whether the Fox people push to quit if this continues.  Or would they go as far as rigging the results?  If they did that and someone leaked it, that would kill the show as well.  There's a real possibility that Howard Stern has the influence to ruin one of the most popular television shows from the last five years.  \r\n\r\nAmazing.\r\n\r\n"

I haven't been a religious devotee of my lessons, but I've averaged about one a week.  I had gone through 41 of 90 lessons by the time we left.\r\n\r\nThis was indeed helpful.  I definitely wasn't able to speak full conversations with the natives, but I could pick out words and phrases.  Combined with frantic gesturing, we were able to discern people's meanings without too much trouble.\r\n\r\nThere were a couple of instances where I was able to approach a Russian, ask a question, and get an answer.  The more interesting time was as we walked toward Red Square and the Kremlin.  It hadn't showed up yet, and I had expected it would.  I approached a guy directing traffic in a uniform and asked \"Where is Red Square?\"  This sounded something like \"G'dere grasnaya bloeshit?\"  I remember laughing out loud while walking the dog at the thought of a neighbor coming out of the house and observing me walking along practicing the word \"bloeshit\" all by myself.  It's a wonder that I haven't been arrested.\r\n\r\n(My other favorite Russian word is the one for \"sixteen.\"  It sounds almost just like the English sentence, \"She snots it.\")\r\n\r\n<table cellpadding=\"2\" align=\"right\"><tr><td width=\"5\" rowspan=\"2\"><spacer type=\"block\" width=\"5\" height=\"1\"><\/td><td width=\"250\" ><img src=\"http:\/\/theskinnyonbenny.com\/img\/gal\/032%20-%20Russia%20Trip%201%20-%20Moscow\/resIMG_20070316_1215.JPG\" height=\"235\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td class=\"caption\" width=\"250\">I don't know if Peg Bundy is the inspiration, but red hair (although often tinted toward purple) is very popular with Russian women.<\/td><\/tr><\/table>\r\n\r\nIt's unbelievably fun to learn about other countries' different cultures.  Who are their celebrities?  What movies do they watch?  What sports are popular?  I think in many western countries, their stars and ours are the same.  That didn't seem to be the case in Russia.  Their MTV showed some videos that I knew, but more that I didn't.  Their pop music tended to be really bad, cheesy pop.  Think Enrique Igasias in Russian.  I saw a number of episodes of dubbed \"The Simpsons,\" and a Russian \"Married With Children,\" recognizable by a similar set, similar-looking cast members, and a similar red wig.\r\n\r\nElsewhere on TV, we saw a lot of Winter Olympic sports.  I remember seeing curling, biathlon (cross-country skiing + rifle shooting), and a lot of hockey.  \r\n\r\nMoscow is a huge city -- a large business center with a population that's perhaps a little smaller, but on the same order of magnitude as London, Tokyo, or New York.  But for all of that, their airport is only a bit bigger than Baton Rouge.  It's about the same size as Raleigh\/Durham.  I imagine it's because of the availability of a decent rail system, and a vestige of the generation where their citizens were mostly prohibited from journeys abroad.\r\n\r\nA good portion of that small airport is dedicated to security.  To catch the plane home, we had to go through the following checkpoints:\r\n\r\n<table cellpadding=\"2\" align=\"right\"><tr><td width=\"5\" rowspan=\"2\"><spacer type=\"block\" width=\"5\" height=\"1\"><\/td><td width=\"250\" ><img src=\"http:\/\/theskinnyonbenny.com\/img\/gal\/031%20-%20Russia%20Trip%201%20-%20Yaroslavl%20and%20Ivan\/resIMG_20070315_1197.JPG\" width=\"235\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td class=\"caption\" width=\"250\">Comfortable train travel means less need for the hassle of airports.<\/td><\/tr><\/table>\r\n\r\n<ul><li>All bags (check and carry-on) x-rayed.

Given the cultural and language barrier, I'm not sure about this, but I think my passport control officer flirted with me.  She gave me a Russian, \"my pleasure,\" as she gave me back my passport, along with an exceedingly friendly (for a Russian) smile.<\/li>\r\n\r\n<li>Before getting to our gate, there was the normal shoes-off, bag x-ray, metal detector walk-through.<\/li>\r\n\r\n<li>After that, everyone got a manual search of the contents of their carry-on bags.  They must not have much trust in their x-ray equipment.<\/li><\/ul>\r\n\r\nBy contrast, when we got to American customs, a passport officer verified our identity and put the information from our declaration into a computer.  We picked up our checked bags, and a cute little beagle gave everything a quick sniff.  His handler surprised me by allowing him to pause to have his ears scratched by Mrs. theskinnyonbenny.  We dragged the checked bags from one carousel to another without any other obvious scrutiny.  And then a pass through the normal shoes-off, bag x-ray, metal detector walk-through.\r\n\r\nOne last observation about Russians, that I haven't been able to work in cleanly.  I hope this doesn't offend any Russian readers or friends, but Russians age amazingly poorly.  The young Russians are -- almost without exception -- quite beautiful.  I can't think of anywhere else I've been where so many of the young are so attractive.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the looks of old people will curdle your milk.\r\n\r\nI don't know if it's the weather, the drinking or genetics that leads to such an extreme loss of attractiveness.\r\n\r\nI was talking about this phenomenon to someone who mentioned that Italian ladies have the same propensity.  This leads me to believe that the weather is a big factor, since my Italian friend Stacey's mother is the most attractive \"lady of advanced years\" that I know."

That has nothing to do with the long and eventful week that I'm about to share, but this is a rather long post.  So those of you at work might want to go ahead and print this one out.  Save it for \"private concentration time.\"  And if you do that, please shoot me a quick email to let me know.  I would be so proud.  And one more thing -- be sure to leave it for the next guy.\r\n\r\nLet's start with my friend Shelly in New Jersey.  I need to reach out to her other friends and see if an intervention of some sort is necessary, because it's obvious to me that either the boredom of school and work or the enduring northern winter is taking its toll.  I fear that she's going to lose it all in the not-too-distant future.\r\n<!--more-->\r\nThere are strong signs of boredom.  Exhibit #1 -- the email links I get to oddball news every day.  Here's a sampling of her comments, along with the links.  To be honest, her comments give you all the good stuff, and I find that it's often not worth following the links.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Mom taught her 2 kids to fake retardation\r\nA woman admitted Monday that she coached her two children to fake retardation starting when they were 4 and 8 years old so she could collect Social Security benefits on their behalf.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.msnbc.msn.com\/id\/17360272\/from\/ET\/\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/www.msnbc.msn.com\/id\/17360272\/from\/ET\/<\/a>\r\n\r\nWhen fake bull testicles are outlawed ...\r\nFake bull testicles and other anatomically explicit vehicle decorations would be banned from Maryland roads under a bill pending in the state legislature.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.msnbc.msn.com\/id\/17302498\/from\/ET\/\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/www.msnbc.msn.com\/id\/17302498\/from\/ET\/<\/a><\/blockquote>\r\n\r\nI had just turned off the projector after completing a presentation when this popped into my Inbox with a subject line featuring \"bull testicles.\"  I have to admit that this would have been hilarious -- and mucho embarrassing -- if the message had come up while I was in view of the whole room.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Wouldn't it be better to just slug hubby?\r\nA Chinese businessman has advertised on the Internet for a stand-in mistress to be beaten up by his wife to vent her anger and to protect his real mistress, Chinese media reported on Monday.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.msnbc.msn.com\/id\/17302498\/from\/ET\/\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/www.msnbc.msn.com\/id\/17342230\/from\/ET\/ \t<\/a>\r\n\r\nWhat is with the Thai people and elephants?\r\n\r\nMan claims record for most squat thrusts\r\nNew Yorker Ashrita Furman looked around for a record he could break, and settled on doing the most squat thrusts in one minute.

But I'm doubtful that the link authors would put, \"What is with the Thai people and elephants?\" in their message.  That just reads in Shelly's voice to me.  And also, it didn't originally have the question mark.  So perhaps she's even summarizing all of these articles for my benefit.\r\n\r\nSome are barely newsworthy:\r\n\r\n<blockquote>I guess this is the equivalence of saying \"Kangaroo spotted in Louisiana\"\r\n\r\n1st Beaver spotted in NYC in 200 years - Yahoo! News\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/news.yahoo.com\/s\/ap\/20070223\/ap_on_sc\/bronx_beaver\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/news.yahoo.com\/s\/ap\/20070223\/ap_on_sc\/bronx_beaver<\/a><\/blockquote>\r\n\r\nThe jist of this one is that some beavers moved in to some river or stream in the Bronx for the first time in a zillion years.

There's only one place where I can grab lunch and get back in a 10-minute span:  the Kentucky Fried Taco Bell.  I had just finished a bean burrito and spicy chicken burrito when an email popped in about the rat infestation at Taco Bell's in New York.\r\n\r\nI wadded up my burrito wrapper, hit the trash can, and replied with something similar to, \"Fuck you.  I just finished my Taco Bell lunch.  There's no way I'm reading this article.\"\r\n\r\n<table cell padding=\"2\" align=\"right\"><tr><td width=\"5\" rowspan=\"2\"><spacer type=\"block\" width=\"5\" height=\"1\"><\/td><td width=\"250\" ><img src=\"\/img\/rats.jpg\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td class=\"caption\" width=\"250\">The cover story about Taco Bell rats that I received in the mail.<\/td><\/tr><\/table>\r\n\r\nI failed to estimate Shelly's love of being a pain in the ass, and I failed to factor in her boredom.  A couple of days later, I got a letter in the mail.  I opened it up, and it's a small newspaper cutout with the article about the rats at Taco Bell.  But Shelly is hard-core, and that wasn't the end of it.  A week later, a letter arrived with a full page cover photo and a long writeup about the rats.  And I got another email about \"Taco Bell's new menu items\":  \r\n\r\n<blockquote>Gordita Rata\r\nGrilled Rat Burrito\r\nRatchos Bell Grande\r\nRati Melt\r\nRat Droppings and Cheese<\/blockquote>\r\n\r\nAs far as I know, Shelly is still planning to come to Louisiana next weekend for St. Patrick's day.  I have to think that it will do her a lot of good.\r\n\r\nIf you either live in mid-Baton Rouge or have been paying careful attention to my posts over the years, March is truly the most wonderful time of the year.  And it all culminates this week, for a whole lot of reasons.  First and foremost, it's hard for me not to put up a boring post every single day that reads like this:\r\n\r\n\"Another wonderful day in Baton Rouge.  The high was 68, but the bright warm sun made it seem 8 degrees warmer.  I drove around in the Jeep with the top down, and was dazzled by all of the explosion of color, flowers suddenly everywhere that was barren just a few weeks ago.\"\r\n\r\nYou add to the weather that the brackets for the NCAA tournament come out today, that Thursday and Friday people's brackets get crushed by 32 games in a college basketball frenzy, that you sneak in the Louisiana Derby horse race, and best of all, the St. Patrick's day in Baton Rouge that must certainly be more fun than those in the big cold cities (which actually have an Irish population).  There's only one thing that I know for sure that I'm going to do in the year 2010:  get really drunk and boil crawfish on the day of the Baton Rouge St. Patrick's Day parade.  That's just another thing that makes it perfect here right now:  hot, salty, succulent boiled crawfish.  Mmmmmmmm.  And while I'm thinking about food, we should be starting to have fresh strawberries available too.\r\n\r\nLooking at my blog archive page, this week is featured prominently every March.  It really is my favorite week of the year, including Christmas.  In fact, I think we should decorate and count down days, just like we do for Christmas.  We would put up some sort of plant, hang lights, and decorate with little shamrocks, leprechauns, basketballs, and beer kegs.\r\n\r\nAt this point, you will be surprised to learn that I'm going to miss it all.  Miss out on my chance to fill out a bracket, miss the games on Thursday and Friday, miss the parade, miss the crawfish, and miss the green beer.  I even got a kick-ass new shirt to wear on parade day this year that will have to gather dust in the closet until 2008.  Instead, I will be traveling.  I'm not inclined to explain my absence, but it will become clear soon enough.\r\n\r\nI don't know whether it's excitement of my upcoming trip, concern about work (where we have more custom software to deliver by April 2 than we normally have in six months), all of personal paperwork that suddenly became urgent this week (Note to Barf:  I have a will for the first time, so there's no need to plot the murder of my entire family), or just the natural sleeplessness that I'm blessed\/cursed with several times a year, but I've been awake and alert between 4:00 and 4:30 most days this week.  Most mornings, I went ahead and went to work.  I can get an amazing amount done in the three or four hours before other people show up and the phone calls start coming in.\r\n\r\nYou know what's even more messed up?  That even goes for Saturday and Sunday.  I started writing this at around 5:30 or 6:00 on Sunday morning.\r\n\r\nThe drawback of my early awakening is that I'm wiped out by lunch time.  By then, I've pretty much worked a full 8-hour day, and the fatigue is high.  So several days this week, I drove to a park very close to the office, parked in either a warm patch of sunshine or in the shade of an oak tree (depending on the temperature), crawled into the back seat of the topless Jeep, and had a power nap.  It's unbelievable how refreshing this is, and I vow to continue my naps until the weather gets too hot.\r\n\r\nSome time during all of this, I realized that we had tickets for a Billy Joel concert in New Orleans that night.  I had gotten to work at 5:00 on Tuesday, and I didn't get a nap that day, but I was still alert and energetic when the concert started at 8:00.  I don't really have much to say about the show.  It was good -- even better than I expected it to be.  He played every hit that I can think of other than \"Uptown Girl,\"\r\nand he sprinkled in some traditional New Orleans related snippits here and there.  We stayed out in the quarter until 1:00, and then Mrs. theskinnyonbenny and I called it a night.  I slept until the monumentally late hour of 6:20, drove back to Baton Rouge, and made it to work not too long after 8:00.  Did I mention that I got a whopping 3.5% raise this year?\r\n\r\nOne night this week, I met my mom, her sister Helen, and Helen's friend Cathy for dinner at Mike Anderson's.  There the mentality of older visitors to Baton Rouge that they must eat at Mike Anderson's.  I even asked them after we finished our meal, \"If they passed a law that said that old people from out of town were no longer allowed to eat at Mike Anderson's, how many minutes would it take them to go out of business?\"\r\n\r\nThe reason that it is old out of towners is that they recall Mike Anderson's from its glory days.  It was probably the best seafood place in Baton Rouge for a 20-year span, which probably makes it one of the best restaurants anywhere during that stretch.  But then Mike opened a couple of other locations.  A fire in the kitchen closed the restaurant for a little while several years ago.  It just never recovered its magic.  And that goes for both food and service.  For the last few years, I would have generously graded it as \"above-average.\"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, other restaurants in town opened, and a lot of them are very good.  So Mike Anderson's quit being a destination for the locals.\r\n\r\nI will admit that it was better this week than it's been in a while.  I would go ahead and grade them as \"good\" in both food and service.  Still not back among the elite restaurants around here, but they've taken a step in the right direction."

Sure, they all keep the tobacco and dirty magazines behind the counter, but aside from that, there are big differences.\r\n\r\nThe worst store I know is the Circle K on Lobdell Blvd in Baton Rouge.  Now it might be better today, as I know a lot of the local Circle K stores have been renovated around here, but in my memory this store is small and dirty.  As soon as you walk in the door, your nostrils are assaulted with the stench of vomit.  Once upon a time, I figured that I had just caught bad timing -- I walked in as the employee had just finished cleaning up some throw-up.  But after three consecutive trips -- all with the puke smell -- well, at some point you have to figure that this is just the suckiest convenience store in the world.  Also, they make you pay before you can pump your gas.  I hate being treated like a criminal.\r\n<!--more-->\r\nThe stores with the \"On the Run\" brand are all pretty good.  They're clean, they have huge selections of fountain drinks, offer Krispy Kreme doughnuts.  They make good coffee and in the mornings, they offer actual milk to accompany it.  They do have fake powdered or oil-based milk substitute, for other times of the day.\r\n\r\nAwards for Scariest Store and Strangest Store both go to the convenience store on the intersection of East Airport and Florida Blvd.  It offers huge cold-saving styrofoam cups for its drinks, but it also includes a bored person sitting in a plexiglass-enclosed check cashing booth, as if he's part of a reptile exhibit at the zoo.  They also have turning racks of sneakers up at the front of the store.  They have the world's largest selection of candy that I've never heard of.  Perhaps one or more of these oddities had something to do with the random shooting that took place there about six weeks ago.  Not coincidentally, this happened right around the LAST time that I was a customer there.\r\n\r\nI like it when the convenience stores have a counter serving hot food.  There's one on Florida as you approach downtown, almost across from the Greyhound bus terminal.  They fry anything under the sun, and there's a line of people to eat it starting early in the day.  I haven't eaten lunch there, but I'm certainly willing to.  A different store near my house sells a pretty darned good gyros sandwich.\r\n\r\nHere's my list of the most unforgivable convenience store sins, in no particular order:\r\n\r\n<ul><li><b>Crushed Ice Only.<\/b><\/li>\r\n\r\n<li><b>Missing lids for the drinks.<\/b><\/li>\r\n\r\n<li><b>Be out of gas.<\/b>  A convenience store out of gas is like a Subway store that's out of bread.  Yes, I've had that happen to me as well.<\/li>\r\n\r\n<li><b>Don't stock Twizzlers.<\/b>  The only time I want a Twizzler is for a long road trip, but for the convenience store manager who fails to stock them when I stop there on my way out of town:  may the Lord damn you to eternal hellfire.<\/li>\r\n\r\n<li><b>Make me go inside to pay.<\/b>  I'm reluctantly willing to pay at the pump and then again at the register.  But I will close the tank and drive off before I walk in to let your clerk hold my credit card while I pump.<\/li>\r\n\r\n<li><b>Don't provide me a pen or pencil to pick my lottery numbers.<\/b>  You're lucky enough that I'm subjecting myself to a voluntary $1 tax.  You get a cut of that.  Don't discourage me.<\/li><\/ul>\r\n"

As any decent event-based party should have, there was gambling.  It was a normal ballot with all of the categories and points broken down as 5 for the big categories that people care about (actor, director, etc.), 3 for the mid-majors (cartoon, song), and 1 for the junk that you just have to sit through (sound editing, best gaffer, and guy who's best at setting up celebrities' trailers on film sets).  The awards were broken down for 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place as 50%\/30%\/25%.\r\n<!--more-->\r\nPredictably, Mrs. theskinnyonbenny had not a cent of money with her.  But I happened to have exactly $10 -- enough to buy two $5 entries.\r\n\r\nAs luck would have it, Mrs. theskinnyonbenny won the pool by a full five points, despite the fact that she had picked and then scratched out the correct Best Picture.  I tied with another guy for 2nd place, so we split the pot 50\/25\/25.  Or rather, Mrs. theskinnyonbenny took home 75% of the pot, while my wallet remains empty.\r\n\r\nSo here's the question, considering the fact that she couldn't have even entered without my entry fee, how much of that pot is mine?  Her final take was right around $100, so that makes the math easy.  I say my third of the $100 is all mine.  It was my entry fee and my picks that make up that amount.  Plus, I should get half of her two-thirds since I ponied up the cash.\r\n\r\n<b>Judge:<\/b>  Ma'am, do you have anything to add to that?\r\n\r\n<b>Mrs:<\/b>  Yes your honor.

It's kind of embarrassing to post a story from the week of Christmas this far after the holiday, but there are two reasons that I'm okay with it.  First, it's an observation that needs to be shared with the world at large who's never tried to drink in a bar in Natchitoches, Louisiana.  Second, nothing ever changes in this bar, so everything short of the candy cane covered sweater will be just as true this coming Saturday, next Saturday, and the first Saturday of July 2009.\r\n<!--more-->\r\nEven though it is a town with a four-year university, Natchitoches is really hard-up for places to hang out.  I'll explain.\r\n\r\nMore than anyone else I know, Mrs. theskinnyonbenny stayed friends with her good friends from high school.  She has three classmates who are still very close friends.  If you've been around this site, you might not know them by name, but you've seen their pictures, read about how much I like their kids, and in Shelly's case, seen daily photos of the icy cold slum that she moved into last year.  Doesn't seem like much?  It's 10% of their senior class.  The equivalent for me would be to keep up with 35 members of my senior class.  I couldn't even name that many of them.\r\n\r\n<table cellpadding=\"2\" align=\"right\"><tr><td width=\"5\" rowspan=\"2\"><spacer type=\"block\" width=\"5\" height=\"1\"><\/td><td width=\"250\" ><img src=\"http:\/\/theskinnyonbenny.com\/img\/gal\/026%20-%20Holiday%20Collection%202006-2007\/resAp230236.JPG\" width=\"225\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td class=\"caption\" width=\"250\">Megan's folks.<\/td><\/tr><\/table>\r\n\r\nWhen we're in Natchitoches during holiday weekends, there are often other friends up there for the same holiday.  More than once, we've been sitting around nursing our drinks at 10:00, and we notice that the staff is putting chairs up on the tables and trying to get home.  Manhattan this is not.\r\n\r\nSometimes, a bar will open up for a little while, but by the next trip it's already closed.  So it comes down to two places:  Antoon's and The Cove.  For some reason, we're much more likely to go to The Cove.  I understand that I've been to Antoon's, but  I can't really picture it.  I don't think this is because I drank to much; I think it's because the place is so dull that I bothered to remember nothing about it.\r\n\r\nThe Cove is a small smoke filled bar attached to a restaurant that is always closed by the time we get there.  The bar runs down one long wall, and a DJ sits up against the opposite wall.  Between them is a dance floor.  The edges have tables, but I don't think there are more than three to five tables on each side of the floor.\r\n\r\nTo visit The Cove is to step back into 1991.  The music would probably even have been considered stale in 91, but the bar selection is right from my early college years.  I would be much more confident in my ability to order a Miller High Life than I would be in getting a Blue Moon.  (But MHL is pretty good to my taste buds, as long as I didn't start with a good brand earlier in the night.)\r\n\r\n<table cellpadding=\"2\" align=\"right\"><tr><td width=\"5\" rowspan=\"2\"><spacer type=\"block\" width=\"5\" height=\"1\"><\/td><td width=\"250\" ><img src=\"http:\/\/theskinnyonbenny.com\/img\/gal\/026%20-%20Holiday%20Collection%202006-2007\/resAp240253.JPG\" width=\"225\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td class=\"caption\" width=\"250\">Line dancing.  See the joy.  Can you deny that if all of the nations' leaders in all of the world had to line dance together that there would be peace on Earth?<\/td><\/tr><\/table>\r\n\r\nMost of all, the line dancing craze is alive and well at The Cove.\r\n\r\nA large group of us were there one night right around Christmas.  I'm sure I've forgotten a lot of the highlights, but here's what I recall:\r\n\r\n<ul><li>Boobsie (aka Megan) has embarrassing parents.  I thought that she was a little old to be embarrassed about being at the same bar as Mom and Dad, but then I saw her folks in action.  Her mom had a bitchin' red sweater, covered in tiny three-dimensional candy canes.  She looked like one of those felt board where preschoolers can go stick other felt pictures to make a scene, but one where any given toddler's only choice was yet another candy cane.<\/li>\r\n\r\n<li>They danced enthusiastically but horribly for a number of hours.  I didn't think it was that bad, so at one point, I went out to dance in their company.  Once I got close, I could hear that Megan's dad was singing along -- pretty loudly -- to Cool and the Gang's \"Celebration.\"  AND HE WAS SCREWING UP THE WORDS!  \"Ceeeeeeel-la-brate fun times COME ON!\"  Funny stuff.<\/li>\r\n\r\n<table cellpadding=\"2\" align=\"right\"><tr><td width=\"5\" rowspan=\"2\"><spacer type=\"block\" width=\"5\" height=\"1\"><\/td><td width=\"250\" ><img src=\"http:\/\/theskinnyonbenny.com\/img\/gal\/026%20-%20Holiday%20Collection%202006-2007\/resAp240255.JPG\" width=\"225\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td class=\"caption\" width=\"250\">The sweatsuit-wearing woman dancing with the old guy.<\/td><\/tr><\/table>\r\n\r\n<li>Amanda really worked hard to fit in with the line dancers.  Every time a line dance would start, she would crinkle her face a little in thought.  I bet she gets the same look while trying to muddle through complicated lawyer documents.  But she would move her feet in with the crowd, but a quarter-beat behind.  An in a minute or two, she would have it down pat.  I bet she can still do them.<\/li>\r\n\r\n<li>I made a game of picking the next song from the playlist.  The choices were pretty obvious:  Strokin', Play that Funky Music White Boy, Brick House, etc.  You all know the playlist, and if you were ever in a wedding band, you could have performed the entire playlist.  But I was money on my picks.  A couple of times I picked the very next song, and often I picked a song and it was played within that half-hour.  Then again, the playlist probably repeats every 90 minutes or so, and it's probably been the same playlist every time I've been there since the early 1990s.<\/i>\r\n\r\n<li>The coup-de-grace was the somewhat attractive but trashy chick who was dressed to kill.  She had a midriff-bearing sweatsuit, in the pattern of that pale desert-storm camouflage.  And she was dancing with a guy who I will only hope and assume was her grandfather.  Except that she was kind of grinding, so I'm not sure what I should hope.  But it was a sight to see -- but only in Natchitoches.<\/li>\r\n\r\n<li>This one's kind of hard to explain.  I was using Shelly's camera, trying to take a stealthy photo of a pair of chicks who were dancing with each other.  But right at the last second, they kind of turned my way, so I made a pivot and hit the button taking a picture of God-knows what.  Except that I had turned the camera right into the front of some other girl's chest.  A big 'ol close up of her boobs is what I got.  I think she turned out to be a friend of Shelly's and was a good sport about it.  I notice that Shelly didn't forward me that picture though.<\/li><\/ul>\r\n\r\nI haven't had any pictures up from near Christmas or from <a href=\"http:\/\/theskinnyonbenny.com\/blog2\/archives\/267\">New Years Eve<\/a>.

Prior to this weekend, I had talked about going to a couple of parades, but hadn't actually been to any.  There were a few decent ones on Saturday, but I skipped those as well.  But I was excited to return to the Krewe of Mutts -- the parade for dogs in downtown Baton Rouge.\r\n\r\nWe had a perfect day, with sunshine and temperatures in the 60s.  The dogs were supposed to be the Blues Brothers, but being young and ornery, they refused to keep their hats or sunglasses on.  So they ended up just being dogs in white shirts and black ties.  It was still kind of funny, but there's no substitute for a dog who wears sunglasses.  Dogs who wear sunglasses <i>always<\/i> get their due props.\r\n<!--more-->\r\n<table cellpadding=\"2\" align=\"right\"><tr><td width=\"5\" rowspan=\"2\"><spacer type=\"block\" width=\"5\" height=\"1\"><\/td><td width=\"250\" ><img src=\"http:\/\/theskinnyonbenny.com\/img\/gal\/029%20-%20Dog%20Parade%202007\/data\/normal.jpg\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td class=\"caption\" width=\"250\">Trying to put the hats and sunglasses on the dogs before the costume contest.  There was no contest -- the dogs beat the humans in this endeavor.<\/td><\/tr><\/table>\r\n\r\nThere were a ton of people out there, but I don't really have any funny stories.  A boxer barked in one of the Asian Cajun twin's face and made her cry.  That was funny to me, but only because I'm an evil bastard.  Oh yeah, and because I heard strangers on the road point out Steve and Jodie as the people with the crying little girl.  (Why would they care that some stranger in the parade has a crying kid?  That's just wierd.)\r\n\r\nThen last night, we caught the very end of the Westminster Dog Show.  Tuesday is obviously a slow TV night.  The dogs up for best in show were mostly odd-looking ones.  Only a couple looked like they could possibly be pets, and two of them were the silliest-looking poodles that I've ever seen.  They didn't look like dogs at all.  One was one of those tiny little poodles, and the other was actually dog-sized, but both of them fit every stereotype that you could imagine.\r\n\r\nThe show was at Madison Square Garden, and I swear I heard booing when the big poodle started doing its laps.  My immediate thought was, \"Man, I love New Yorkers!  Booing a DOG!  How low is that!\"  Unfortunately, the dog didn't seem to mind.\r\n\r\nThen I got to thinking, \"Would dog show people really boo a dog?\"  They put on jackets and ties to go to Madison Square Garden; these aren't the Knicks fans who normally occupy those same seats.  So I decided that they were really saying, \"Pooooooooooooooodle.\"\r\n\r\nYou may have heard that Bill Cosby's dog made the final.  It was some breed I never heard of.  Cute body, but wierd face.  (I remember using that same sentance to describe some of my dates during my first college semester.)\r\n\r\nI have a handful of pictures from the parade posted <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"window.open('\/pg3.php?spgmGal=029%20-%20Dog%20Parade%202007','029DogParade2007','width=1024, height=768, toolbar=no, location = no, directories=no, menubar=no, resizable=yes, scrollbars=no');\" >here<\/a>.\r\n\r\nIt ended with a fizzle.  It's definitely an event that needs some live music and a beer truck at the end.  Perhaps I'll push for that next year.  Or maybe, we'll try Krewe of Barkus in New Orleans."

I was backed up and annoyed with whatever I was doing, and I got a phone call from someone who could only want me to do something for her -- never the other way around.  For some reason, I picked up the phone.\r\n\r\n\"We need you to come to a meeting to talk about how we could make the users' conference better for next year.\"\r\n\r\nOur annual user conference had just ended, but I hadn't been down there at all on that particular year.  \"I can't contribute to that.  I wasn't even down there.\"\r\n\r\n\"It doesn't matter.  We just need you to come.\"\r\n\r\n\"When?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's right now.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I'm really busy, I can't come right now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Look, we need you there right now.\"\r\n\r\nFor some reason I went.\r\n\r\nFive minutes later, I found myself in a conference room in a different building.  I had a pad of paper and was jotting down a couple of ideas about the conference based on feedback I had heard from others.  Other people from all around the company came in and sat down.  No one really had the look of someone who wanted to be there.\r\n\r\nTen minutes after the meeting was scheduled to start, the female VP of sales came in the room, shut the blinds, and dropped a large stack on singles on the table.  At that time, I was firmly in the middle of bachelor party age, and I knew what was coming.  But some piece of my brain still didn't comprehend.\r\n\r\nThe woman was dressed like a cop.  Someone turned on a jam box, and she started doing her thing.\r\n\r\nRather than excited or juvenile, the mood was just uncomfortable.  We didn't all really know each other very well, and we were just minutes away from dealing with our workplace irritants.  No one had had a chance to relax.  No one had been drinking.\r\n\r\nIt felt a little like a setup.  Was there a secret camera for some cable comedy show?  Was the boss going to walk in and fire us all?  No one knew.\r\n\r\nAfter a while, the woman was on the table in her g-string and pasties.  There were some half-hearted tucking of dollars into her garter belt, and I'll admit that I pocketed a couple of those dollars for my own trouble that afternoon.  It was every bit as uncomfortable as that episode of <i>The Office<\/i> last night.\r\n\r\nWhen it was done, we laughed a little bit, split apart, and returned to our various buildings.  Back to work, neither enlivened nor entertained.\r\n\r\n"

		"post_content" : "I'm posting this from a short work trip to North Carolina.  I flew into Raleigh with Tyler (of sporadic haiku acclaim) and Ann, a sixty year old career woman whose energy and patience is double what we younger guys have.\r\n\r\nWhile we were walking out of the Raleigh airport, she's moving along at a good clip, toting what appears to be seventy-five pounds of luggage.  We got to an intersection, and she asked, \"You guys want to take a short cut out of here?\"\r\n\r\n\"But Ann, that says for wheelchairs only.\"\r\n<!--more-->\r\nShe slowed her pace, lost her good posture, and some sudden bit of magic made her out of breath as she approached the guard -- the man whose only job is to sit at that door and make sure no one who is not wheelchair bound gets to take the shortcut.\r\n\r\n\"Excuse me sir (gasp).  Are (huff) the escalators down there (huff) working?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes ma'am, but would you like to take the elevator?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes, please.  Can (gasp) these guys come with me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly.\"\r\n\r\nI guess when your only job is to sit by a door and open it every once in a while, you go ahead and take any chance for that one possible break in the routine that you can get.\r\n\r\nOnce past the shortcut door, we had to march through the zig zag line of people waiting to check into security.  A TSA official stopped the line, opened the nylon line zig zag holder, and let us pass through to the elevators.\r\n\r\nWhen the elevator door closed, Ann went back to her energetic self.  \"Shit, that's too far to walk for no good reason.\"\r\n\r\n<center><img src=\"\/img\/greenline.gif\"><\/center>\r\n\r\n<table><tr><td><table cellpadding=\"2\" align=\"right\"><tr><td width=\"5\" rowspan=\"2\"><spacer type=\"block\" width=\"5\" height=\"1\"><\/td><td ><img src=\"\/img\/bigouthouse.jpg\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td class=\"caption\" >This really big outhouse serves the work population of a large building in an office park in Rocky Mount, NC.<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>\r\n\r\nI spent the afternoon in a meeting going line by line through some technical documentation.  There were a couple of odd things about the location of our meeting.  First, there was no indoor plumbing.  Honest to God.  The facilities were in a large clean mobile home type of out building, with boat type of commodes without water in the bowl.  Second, it was right along a frequently used train tracks.  After a while, I started interrupting the meeting with announcements about the trains.\r\n\r\n\"There's the 4:45, right on schedule.\"  Everyone else ignored me.\r\n\r\n\"There's the 5:02, right on schedule.\"  Ignored again.\r\n\r\n\"There's the 5:22, right on schedule.\"  Just before I made this announcement, I saw Tyler look up.  He appeared the be the only one who anticipated my question.\r\n\r\nAnother lady asked, \"Do you have them all memorized?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah, I took a look over the train schedule during the drive over.  There wasn't much else to do.\"  I'm not sure if she believed me.<\/td><\/tr><\/table>\r\n\r\n<center><img src=\"\/img\/greenline.gif\"><\/center>\r\n\r\nThat night at dinner, we got seated at a long table against the wall at an Outback Steakhouse.\r\n\r\n\"Man, I love big booths,\" said Tyler as he slid in.  But it didn't sound like \"booths.\"\r\n\r\nI wouldn't have laughed except that Ann started cackling.  A random, \"Man, I love big boobs,\" would be much funnier.  I encourage you all to try to work that into conversation today."

		"post_content" : "This is the first weekend of the last three that I've been at home with Mrs. theskinnyonbenny.  It's good to be back in a routine, but cold and rainy Louisiana winters are for the birds.  We had two days without rain this week, and I made it outside to enjoy the sunshine somewhere around zero minutes.  The weekend forecast is entirely for rain.\r\n\r\nLast weekend was another wet one, but colder, and in Chicago.  We went for the once in a lifetime chance to see the Saints play in a championship game, and also to cross of \"See a game in a snowy, freezing stadium up north in January\" from the list of things everyone should do once in life.  I strongly suggest that everyone make an attempt to have this experience, but I'm not sure I want to go to another game in sleet\/wet\/snow any time soon.\r\n<!--more-->\r\nWe took a train the morning of the game from Crystal and Brent's town into downtown Chicago.  From there, we caught a cab to a hotel where we were to pick up tickets and start drinking with hundreds of other game-goers.  Of all of the thousands of cabs, we got into cab number 26 -- Deuce McAllister's number.  I thought that was a certain sign of a Saints win on Sunday.\r\n\r\n<table cellpadding=\"2\" align=\"right\"><tr><td width=\"5\" rowspan=\"2\"><spacer type=\"block\" width=\"5\" height=\"1\"><\/td><td width=\"250\" ><img src=\"http:\/\/theskinnyonbenny.com\/img\/gal\/027%20-%20Chicago%20Trip%2007%20-%20Saints%20vs.%20Bears\/resIMG_20070121_0925.JPG\" width=\"250\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td class=\"caption\" width=\"250\">Saints fans flood Michigan Avenue to head to the game.<\/td><\/tr><\/table>\r\n\r\nThe bar at the hotel was socked full of fans from both teams.  The Saints fans monopolized the area closest to the bar, and the Bears fans migrated away more toward the tables.  For a good two hours, there was more or less constant chanting or singing from one group or other.  \r\n\r\nMy <a onclick=\"window.open('\/pg3.php?spgmGal=027%20-%20Chicago%20Trip%2007%20-%20Saints%20vs.%20Bears','027ChicagoTrip07SaintsvsBears','width=1024, height=768, toolbar=no, location = no, directories=no, menubar=no, resizable=yes, scrollbars=no');\" onmouseover=\"chgImg ('i027ChicagoTrip07SaintsvsBears','img027ChicagoTrip07SaintsvsBearsRed');\" onmouseout=\"chgImg ('i027ChicagoTrip07SaintsvsBears','img027ChicagoTrip07SaintsvsBears');\" > game day photos<\/a> almost -- but not quite -- do justice to the party of Saints fans that marched in a massive sea of black from Michigan Avenue to the stadium a couple of hours before game time.  The crowd was huge and wild and fantastically loud.  It felt like we ruled that city, and I guess that's the truth of the couple of block stretch that we took up.  As we passed a hill on the lakefront park, a Saints fan yelled, \"WE'RE TAKING THE HILL\" and led a small charge up toward a couple of baffled and cold cops.  It was about that point that I noticed that I had lost a glove, which gave me worry about my ability to hang in through the cold for the next five hours.\r\n\r\nI had prepared for the weather with long underwear, cargo pants, another undershirt, a fleece sweatshirt, and my heaviest jacket.  I had two pairs of socks and shoes that fortunately proved waterproof.  I had a knit hat under my Fleur de Lis cap, and a pocket with a few of those chemical hand-warmer packs.\r\n\r\nThe marching crowd stopped outside the art museum, before we would have to break apart and go to our separate ramps and tunnels to get into the stadium.  Someone had a tuba and played staccato tuba notes that characterize the New Orleans style of jazz and funk.  I wondered aloud what he would do with a tuba in the stadium, but no one had an answer for me.  More chanting, a little more singing, some more photos, and we broke apart and entered the stadium.\r\n\r\n<table cellpadding=\"2\" align=\"right\"><tr><td width=\"5\" rowspan=\"2\"><spacer type=\"block\" width=\"5\" height=\"1\"><\/td><td width=\"250\" ><img src=\"http:\/\/theskinnyonbenny.com\/img\/gal\/027%20-%20Chicago%20Trip%2007%20-%20Saints%20vs.%20Bears\/resIMG_20070121_0962.JPG\" width=\"250\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td class=\"caption\" width=\"250\">Mrs. theskinnyonbenny and Stacie drink a beer in their seats at Soldier Field.<\/td><\/tr><\/table>\r\n\r\nPeople at the gates were giving away orange towels to wave during the game.  Many Saints fans turned them away, but Brent had called and warned me to pick up a towel for wiping snow out of our seats.  Great, great advice, which I passed along to as many of the other Saints fans as would listen.  I heard one guy say in a heavy New Orleans accent, \"Ah'll use it fer toirlet papah.\"\r\n\r\nChicago is a fine city, but they're not too good about helping their visitors get enough alcohol in their system for a cold football game.  The bar at the hotel refused to drop shots into our glasses of Guinness.  The beer stand at the stadium would only let me buy two at a time.  But at least there was no worry about them getting ward in the 28 degree air and snowy cup holder.\r\n\r\nIt wasn't as lonely in the stadium as I expected.  There were other groups of Saints fans pretty near by.  Bears fans are getting a lot of rap for being dickheads, but I didn't find them to be too bad.  I was disappointed that their heckling wasn't very funny, but it wasn't particularly mean-spirited either.  And a couple of fans made the point to be welcoming and thank us for making  the trip up.\r\n\r\nThe cold wasn't as bad as I had expected, really.  I never got to the point of shivering, but my hands and feet were painfully cold starting in the fourth quarter.  Perhaps it's fortunate that the Saints' play didn't necessitate that we stay for the full duration of the game, and we were out of there with 5 minutes left to play.\r\n\r\nOn the train ride back, we finally got those chemical hand warmers to start working.  We are true cold-weather rookies.  We are also train-riding rookies, as we missed our stop, and then were too slow to get up and get to the door on time for the stop after that.  Crystal had to drive two train stations farther to find us.\r\n\r\nOnce we got home, it was a hot shower, a couple of bowls of chili, the last twenty minutes of the AFC Championship game, and bed.\r\n\r\n"

I dialed in to the number, and found that it was just hold music.  The host hadn't started the call yet.\r\n\r\nStuffing the phone in my pocket and the ear bud in my ear, I said a quick prayer to make my movement a quick and easy one.  I figured I could get in, do my business, and then chime in on the call while they were still doing introductions and pleasantries.\r\n<!--more-->\r\nFast forward 45 minutes. I'm on my second toilet of the morning, wishing away stomach spasms and the accompanying nastiness.  Over the next 90 minutes, there would be two more toilets.\r\n\r\nIf you know me, you will realize that I'm dying to give detail after gory detail about my diarrhea.  But in order to keep it from getting too gross, I'll keep it to two more quick details.\r\n\r\n<URL><li>It looked like wet sand, but brownish-green.  In fact, it was the greenest poo that I've ever seen.  (I ate a lot of cole slaw last night.  Cabbage?)<\/li><li>It came on suddenly and strongly enough, that I had to discard my underwear in a gas station restroom today.<\/li><\/ul>\r\n\r\nI went home, showered, and changed, and my little problem gradually subsided.\r\n\r\nSo when your work day is hectic, take a little time for caution.  Think before you pray.  And pay good attention to your time zone conversions.  I was on the call four hours ahead of when I needed to be.  There was no need at all to pray for the loosey-gooseys.\r\n\r\n<center><img src=\"\/img\/greenline.gif\"><\/center>\r\n\r\nWe have a coworker who has a really nice personal milestone coming up.  The nicest member of our team sent the rest of us an email suggesting that we send some sort of gesture of congratulations.  She intended a gift or perhaps a cocktail hour after work one evening.\r\n\r\nThe only response she got back asked, \"Are you suggesting that we take him to a gentleman's club?\"\r\n\r\nI can just picture the scene.  There are ten of us sitting around a table.  On the table top a stripper goes through her motions.  Although the majority of the crowd is young men (and middle aged men like me who still think young), there are also a grandmother and a young lady at the table.  Eight of us shift our weight uncomfortably, wondering how to behave and where the appropriate place for our eyes to focus in this co-ed mix of coworkers.  Jeremy sits comfortably in the middle, oblivious to everyone's discomfort, cooly tucking singles into the dancer's garter while trying to chat it up with her.  Meanwhile, Alan behaves like a member of the Arsenio Hall audience of circa 2001, pumping a fist above his head while shouting \"WOOFWOOFWOOFWOOF\" every time the dancer's buttocks come near his face.\r\n\r\n(And just to be really clear, this \"Jeremy\" and \"Alan\" are fictional characters that I made up, bearing almost no resemblance to the coworkers of mine who coincidentally share those same first names.)\r\n\r\nThere's a really funny facet about the gentlemen's clubs in the south part of Baton Rouge.  It used to be that if you followed Airline Highway south out of town, you got more and more rural, and there was a stretch that was chock-full of titty bars.  I guess it was close enough to town for the young guys to make the drive, but far enough out that the rent was cheap.\r\n\r\nOver the years, the mainstream subdivisions moved farther and farther south, taking grocery stores, day cares, and strip malls along with them.  Today, the strippers drive into busy parking lots, and go into their establishment which is right in the middle of Blockbusters, chain restaurants, laundry mats, and all other things suburban.\r\n\r\nIf those places can hang on, it will be really convenient for that group of future strippers who are today the little girls of the young families who live out in those suburbs.\r\n\r\nThat reminds me of something else funny that I read earlier this week.  Bill Simmons started giving his wife a weekly sidebar on one of his columns on espn.com.  This is from her sidebar this week.\r\n<blockquote>The \"Deal or No Deal\" models bug me because they peek into the suitcases now and milk their 10 seconds for all it's worth. Ladies, just shut your trap, open the case and be thankful you're not clinging to a stripper's pole anymore.<\/blockquote>\r\n\r\nI hadn't really thought about it, but that is an annoying facet of that show.  It used to be just once or twice a show that they would do that, but now, it's every single box.  Buncha monkeys is what they are.  Really good looking monkeys, but monkeys nevertheless.\r\n\r\n<i>Deal or No Deal<\/i> has passed <i>American Idol<\/i> as the show that I have least interest in watching, but am strangely unable to turn off if I happen to catch a little by accident.\r\n\r\n"

We reorganized the company a few years ago, and the resulting structure and physical layout eliminated 90% of the internal meetings that wasted the days away.\r\n\r\nIn the intervening years, some aspects of meeting culture have changed.  Take, for example, a meeting I was invited to this week where there were about 10 to 12 people from our office and 10 to 12 people from corporate headquarters.\r\n<!--more-->\r\nAll of the headquarters people sporting the previous-generation Blackberry.  The guy next to me spent the entire hour clicking away at a distracting 40 words per minute, oblivious to the nasty stares of those around him.\r\n\r\nThese big gadgets are too wide for the average pocket, so they sport them on their belt clips a la Batman and Robin.  I heard one of my coworkers liken them to carrying around a piece of toast.  It would be a very cool look, if it were only 1996.\r\n\r\nI don't want to seem like I'm picking on just my corporate counterparts; many of them were as annoyed as I was.  Also, this was the third meeting in the past couple of months where there were participants who pretended to pay attention while pecking away on their gizmos, and all were with entirely different groups of people.  People who don't even know each other or have any interaction.  When did this become okay in the normal office etiquette?\r\n\r\nIt's clear enough that the people don't care about learning the information that they're supposed to get from these presentations?  So why don't they just excuse themselves and quit annoying the rest of us with their incessant little tap-tap-tapping?  I'm not asking these questions rhetorically.  I truly don't understand.\r\n\r\nAs an aside, the big boss did pause during his introduction of me to tell the other people from corporate, \"Ben has a very funny blog site which you should never, ever read.\"\r\n\r\nSage advice, for sure.\r\n\r\n"

		"post_content" : "I started several posts this week, but never had the time to go back and look over what I read, fix the really dumb mistakes, and get them posted.  There were a lot of sports-related topics on my mind this week, so I've combined a few different false-starts into a single weekly sports post for today.\r\n<!--more-->\r\n<center><img src=\"\/img\/greenline.gif\"><\/center>\r\n\r\nThe king of all sports is over for the year.  Sigh.  I've got nothing to say about Florida's pasting of Ohio State.  It always feels weird during the bowl games to pull for the conference rivals that I hope to see beaten and\/or seriously injured during the regular season, but I'm glad to see the national championship back in the SEC where it belongs.\r\n\r\nI remember when LSU won its first of the three recent Sugar Bowl victories after the 2001 season.  The happiness for the BCS win is the same this year, but I'm missing the disbelief that comes with a BCS win after a decade of being a fan of a bad football team.  I remember being really upbeat about Independence Bowl wins.\r\n\r\nAfter that game, someone asked me how many College World Series championships I would trade for a single Sugar Bowl win.  (Three.)  Given the state of our baseball program, I think that a lot of LSU fans figured out how to make such deals with the sports gods.\r\n\r\nI wonder what Florida had to trade the sports gods for championships in football and basketball?  I liked how the announcer last night threw in Dancing With the Stars as a third championship.\r\n\r\nNow that college is done, I'm very much looking forward the Saints game Saturday night.  There's such a random quality about any NFL game.  Did you know that underdogs actually won more games outright than they lost during this NFL season?  If the Saints and the Bears both win, I'm definitely going to Chicago for the NFC championship.  I suppose I should pull for the Seahawks, so that the Saints could have the NFC championship at home.  But how much fun would it be to go to a Soldier Field (or whatever corporation it's named for now) playoff game in January?\r\n\r\nThe main thing is going to be keeping Jeff Garcia from getting loose and having the chance to make creative plays.  They defended similar quarterbacks (Tony Romo, Michael Vick) very well this season.  I can't wait to see how it goes, and I can't bear to read or watch another minute of prognostication.\r\n\r\n<center><img src=\"\/img\/greenline.gif\"><\/center>\r\n\r\nI haven't mentioned the Nick Saban thing because there isn't much to add to what all of the columnists have already written.  I do think it's interesting that he's replaced TO as the representation of all that is wrong with sports.  I don't really begrudge the guy for going to Bama, although I wish he had \"followed his heart\" back to another conference.  \r\n\r\nI did feel sorry for Huizinga, the Dolphins owner.  Saban left him to face the Miami media all by himself, and I thought he was going to break down and cry up there.  He even asked the reporters for suggestions on how to build a winning franchise.  I think it's time for him to hang it up as an owner.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/sports.espn.go.com\/espn\/page2\/story?page=simmons\/070105\r\n\" target=\"_blank\">Bill Simmons had a really good column this week<\/a>, and he did a good job of summarizing the common sense take on Saban's move.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Hearing the news that Nick Saban was headed to Alabama. Yippee!!!!!! The Patriots just lost the biggest coaching threat in their division!!!!! You'll hear no \"Nick Saban is a lying scumbag\" comments from this guy. For one thing, coaches pull this crap all the time -- they switch schools, switch teams, jump back and forth from college to the pros, and only remain loyal to themselves and their bank accounts. So this shouldn't have been a surprise to anyone. When we go more than three months without a visible coach boning over a pro team or a college, let me know.\r\n\r\nBut here's why I enjoyed this particular bone job so much: Last spring, Saban was deciding between Drew Brees and Daunte Culpepper and ended up signing the wrong guy. Huge mistake on about 20 different levels, but the important thing to remember is that one decision killed Miami's entire season. And he made it. Anyway, the season finally ends and Saban says to himself, \"Well, I can kill myself working 16 hours a day trying to make it work in a tough division with Culpepper, Joey Harrington and Cleo Lemon as my QBs ... or I can get a fresh start with the most famous coaching job in college football for $32 million guaranteed. Hmmmmmm.\"\r\n\r\nI mean ... OF COURSE he was going to leave! Did you really think he was sticking around? I'm surprised he didn't leave treadmarks. So Saban rides off into the sunset, never to be seen again, and the poor Dolphins fans wake up tomorrow and they're still stuck with Culpepper, Harrington and Lemon. How is that fair? I hope the Dolphins fans band together and break the record for \"most turd sandwiches ever FedEx'd to one person.\"<\/blockquote>\r\n\r\n<center><img src=\"\/img\/greenline.gif\"><\/center>\r\n\r\nWhile I'm doing a sports post, I might as well make a couple of basketball notes.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, Tack Minor played something like 20 minutes against UConn this weekend without a single turnover.  Despite the fact that it seems like Minor is into his sixth or seventh year of college basketball (didn't he replace TJ Pugh as point guard in the early 90s?), I doubt he has ever had a turnover-free game before.  He's the college basketball equivalent of Devry Henderson -- he either makes a huge play, or drops a wide-open pass.\r\n\r\nI'm gonna go ahead and make the call that the Hornets should move permanently to Oklahoma City.  They brought out 16,000 fans in an ice storm last night to see a team devoid of all its stars.  Desmond Mason led the team in scoring.  They will <i>never<\/i> have that sort of support in New Orleans, no how rebuilt and prosperous the city becomes.\r\n\r\nFor the first time since the Michael Jordan era, I find myself looking for games where I have no regional rooting interest.  I'm looking for the Suns.  The way they move the ball around is unlike any NBA team that I've seen, and it's amazing to watch.  I've always been a fan of the assist and have occasionally gotten chill bumps at a perfectly executed bounce pass through traffic.  The Suns do it all the time.  I was watching Sports Center Friday morning, and out slipped an \"Oh my God!\"\r\n\r\nMrs. theskinnyonbenny caught it in her half-sleep all the way back in the bedroom and responded with a loud concerned, \"What's the matter?\"\r\n\r\nShe was unimpressed with my description of an amazing behind the back pass from Steve Nash.  He ended up with 21 assists for that game, by the way."

I didn't take many pictures to post, and a lot of the fun that I had either doesn't translate into a good story, or it's forgotten forever.\r\n<!--more-->\r\nThe night before that, we had hosted our friend Mary Ann, and (read this next part in a Mississippi accent) a guy who goes by name of Skeeter.  They were down from Mrs. theskinnyonbenny's home town.  Maryann (I don't know how she spells it, so I'll try different possibilities.  One will be right.)  had been down for a party once before, and we had run into her in a bar the weekend of Christmas.  They were on their way to New Orleans for New Year's Eve, and agreed to stay Saturday night at our house for a taste of Baton Rouge.\r\n\r\n<ul><li>At 11:00, we heard from Shelly and Boobsie, who were celebrating in New York City.  Since it was already 2007 there, I asked the person on the phone to find out if they had hover cars in 2007 yet.  As we all know by now, there is a disappointing lack of hover cars in 2007.  What's taking them so long with that?<\/li>\r\n\r\n<li>Before anyone got to the house, Blossom the Basset Hound got up on top of the table outside.  She had time to eat an entire block of Havarti-pepper cheese, a bowl of crab dip, and two boxes of crackers.  And she still terrorized the kids at the party, trying and sometimes succeeding in getting their food.<\/li>\r\n\r\n<li>At midnight, I had a little bit of sense left, as I saw Joel and Sharples giving champagne bottles ferocious shake-ups for a good dousing.  I was the only one under the Regal Beagle roof to process that information and know to get out from under there right away.  I missed my midnight kiss, but I stayed dry also.<\/li>\r\n\r\n<li>I drank a whole lot of a particularly delightful cocktail.  The \"car bomb\" is a pint of Guinness, with a shot glass of Jameson's on top of Bailey's dropped in.  (Apparently, the three Irish potables lead to the naming of the drink of a popular Irish pastime of the 1980s.)  Consumed quickly, it tasted like a soft drink.  I think I had three.<\/li>\r\n\r\n<li>At some point, I realized that our friend Mary Ann had left her camera at our house from the previous night out.  It occurred to me that I was obligated to a particular brand of mischief, and I only had to mention an ownerless camera for Sharples to understand right where I was going.  Sharples's wife Amanda described the scene best as she came out of the bathroom right as we were completing our photo shoot.\r\n\r\n\"Even if I hadn't come around the corner to see you re-fastening your pants, I could still here you in there saying, 'C'mon Benny.  I gotta get a picture of my nuts.  Take a good one of my nuts.  Didya get 'em good?'\"\r\n\r\nThat all went along with my wild laughter.  The pictures are even a little too gross for me to post here, but take my word for it, the one of me naked as a jaybird, fully frontal, and in a muscle-man pose is nothing short of the pinnacle of hilarity.\r\n\r\nBy the way, if you know Mary Ann, don't tell her about this.  It's only funny if she finds those pictures herself when she gets her camera back.  Or better yet, if she just took the memory card to Wal-Mart to get them developed.\r\n\r\n<li>I don't remember much after about 2:30.  I remember seeing one of the biggest party bruises that I've ever seen on someone's head, but that's not too funny.  There was the guy who I didn't know who decided to walk home once he was tired and his ride was still good to go.  If I understood correctly, he lives on Nicholson drive, which I would guess to be a minimum of a 4.5 mile walk.  So it wouldn't be a big surprise if he ended up sleeping it off on the side of a street somewhere.  Fortunately, it wasn't so cold that such a nap would be fatal.<\/li>\r\n\r\n<li>At some point, someone noticed that the sky in the east was getting light.  We walked around the corner, where Jim cooked us breakfast at his out-of-town next-door neighbor's house.  I made it back home and got into bed around 7:30.<\/li><\/ul>\r\n\r\nOn New Year's Day, I got up at noon, and watched game after uneventful football game.  I tried to get a nap later in the afternoon, but every time I would start to doze, something would happen to jar me awake.  Mostly, the pets are to blame.  At least Blossom was sick most of the morning after her gorging.\r\n\r\nAfter all of the crappy day games, Oklahoma took a two-touchdown lead over Boise State, and I allowed myself to go to sleep.  Of course you know that I completely missed the game of the year.  I haven't even seen the highlights yet, although I've heard them described a hundred times.  This week, you have to understand any allusion to the \"hook and lateral\" to be culturally conversant.\r\n\r\nLast night's Orange Bowl was an okay game, but what really struck me was the honorary captains who came out for the coin toss.  Easily the worst BCS game -- Louisville and Wake Forest -- ended up with Mohammad Ali and Arnold Palmer at midfield before the game.  If you think about it, only Tiger Woods and Michael Jordan are also in the Ali\/Palmer stratosphere of worldwide sports legends.\r\n\r\nBut instead of being inspiring, Ali's presence was just kind of sad.  You've probably seen him shaking from Parkinson's and deprived of speech, but last night, they had to bring him to midfield in a golf cart.  He didn't really even look like he knew what he was doing out there.  It's not my nature to feel sorry for a guy who made a career of getting hit in the face and then ends up with a brain that doesn't work, but you can't see Ali without feeling kind of bad for the guy.\r\n\r\nYou know how A&E as a Biography episode queued up for anyone famous who dies?  Ali just replaced Gerald Ford's video cassette at the top of that stack.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Because I love to play with fire, it takes only a slightly cold or damp period to get me to light one up, so we were enjoying the warmth between face fulls of smoke.\r\n<!--more-->\r\n<table cellpadding=\"2\" align=\"right\"><tr><td width=\"5\" rowspan=\"2\"><spacer type=\"block\" width=\"5\" height=\"1\"><\/td><td width=\"250\" ><img src=\"\/img\/poop1.jpg\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td class=\"caption\" width=\"250\">Dog poop, collected along with a couple of leaves.<\/td><\/tr><\/table>\r\n\r\nPerhaps the biggest drawback of my back yard is that there aren't any open grassy areas for dogs to use as a toilet.  It necessitates an almost constant effort to pick up dog poop and hose down the spots where the poop was soft.  Especially because I usually go out there barefoot.\r\n\r\nThis particular night, I had the bright idea to see if we could burn some of the poop.  I think it was born out of a sense of environmentalism.  (Just think about how valuable my poopy patio becomes if we find a viable way to turn poo into a renewable energy source.  Poopodiesel?)\r\n\r\nWe went to one of Blossom's favorite spots, as her turds are the size of a small elephant's.  We swept up a good pile and threw them in to burn.\r\n\r\n<table border = \"0\" cellpadding=\"25px\">\r\n\r\n<tr>\r\n\t<td><img src=\"\/img\/poop2.jpg\"><\/td>\r\n\t<td class=\"caption\">Into the fire pit.<\/td>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n\t<td><img src=\"\/img\/poop3.jpg\"><\/td>\r\n\t<td class=\"caption\" >Alight.<\/td>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n\t<td><img src=\"\/img\/poop4.jpg\"><\/td>\r\n\t<td class=\"caption\">A steady, nice burn.<\/td>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n<\/table>\r\n\r\nHere's what I learned:  I've been wasting my money on starter logs.  The poop caught quickly, burned steadily, and lasted a while.  It didn't smoke excessively or make the fire stink.  It was pretty much exactly like burning a starter log.\r\n\r\nThis is just the kind of genius that regularly comes from people drinking at the Regal Beagle.  Unfortunately, much of that genius gets forgotten in the night -- between when we leave the bar area and when we wake up the next morning.\r\n\r\nTo that end, my resolution for 2007 is to launch the \"Live From the Regal Beagle\" video podcast.  The idea is to have crappy armature video of what happens out there after the first few rounds are consumed and the real bullshit starts to take place.  I'll condense that to a highlight reel lasting from five to twenty minutes, and publish it for anyone who wants to see.\r\n\r\nI think this is my path to fame and fortune.\r\n\r\nThat and the poopodiesel.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The food was doubly as good this time.  Maybe not mind-shatteringly delicious, but it was really, really damned good.  So I guess Emeril has gotten back to what put him on the map:  making food.\r\n\r\nIt's a little bit stunning the Emeril got so nationally famous so incredibly fast.  For the love of God, someone okayed him getting his own <i>sitcom<\/i>, despite the fact that he had never shown an inclination to being able to act and never showed a hint of ability to be funny.  I wonder who gave that one the green-light?  I bet that person's scooping leaves out of the swimming pools of more successful Hollywood types by now.\r\n<!--more-->\r\nI'm off topic already, but the current celebrity chef who is getting way too much credit is Rachel Ray.  Why does anyone find her to be such a genius?  If there was a way to gamble on celebrities whose bubble is about to burst, I would take my K-Fed winnings and double down on Rachel.  \r\n\r\n(Alton Brown by contrast is the quiet genius of Food TV.  If that guy told me that putting a scoop of dirty cat litter into my breakfast cereal would alter some molecules and make it taste like chocolate, while giving me great big muscles, I would believe him.  But he would have to say it in that serious \"Mr. Science but not condescending\" manner that he's perfected.)\r\n\r\n<table cellpadding=\"2\" align=\"right\"><tr><td width=\"5\" rowspan=\"2\"><spacer type=\"block\" width=\"5\" height=\"1\"><\/td><td width=\"250\" ><img src=\"http:\/\/theskinnyonbenny.com\/img\/gal\/025%20-%20Colorado%20-%20Dec%202006\/resPicture020.jpg\" width=\"250\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td class=\"caption\" width=\"250\">This is Amanda and Clay at The W.  I don't really remember what's going on during this shot, but it wasn't far from the point where I used the candles on the bar to demonstrate my freakishly high tolerance to heat.  I refer to this as \"my superpower.\"<\/td><\/tr><\/table>\r\n\r\nAfter Emeril's, we walked back to the French quarter, stopping at Tommy's Wine Bar (formerly The Wine Loft).  Didn't even make it a full block before our first bar stop, but hey -- it was really cold that night.  We then went to that trendy blue bar with all the candles at The W Hotel, followed by The Kerry -- my favorite little whole in the wall down in the quarter.\r\n\r\nThe Kerry was mostly empty.  There was a band of three, a few of their friends sitting up near them, and a smattering of people at the bar.  The rest of the tables in the place were empty.  We joined the bar people on the last empty corner, and ordered a round of drinks.  The band wasn't awful, but they were rather typical of the Kerry's normal entertainment:  folksy not quite rock, not quite country, and perhaps with a healthy dose of Irish sound.  We talked, and they played song after song that I didn't recognize.\r\n\r\nAfter a while, I was using a urinal which although separated by a wall, was right behind the band.  I started to recognize the song that was on.\r\n\r\nWhile I peed, I sang the song real fast in my head, getting up to the chorus so I would realize what it was.  Cheese city, but I timed my pee to come out of the restroom as they were finishing up the verse.\r\n\r\nI have some tradition of joining the band at The Kerry.  (And by \"some tradition,\" I mean that I did it once.  But my singing that time was very popular.  I'll have to tell that story another time.)  So there was no hesitation as I grabbed an empty microphone, slid the switch to \"On,\" and joined their real singer:\r\n\r\n<center>Country Roooooaaaaadddd\r\nTake me hooooommmmmeeee\r\nTo the plaaaaaaaccccceee\r\nWhere I beloooonnnggggg\r\nWest Virginiaaaaaaaaaa\r\nMountain Maaaamaaaaaaaaa\r\nTake me hooooommmmmeeee\r\nCountry Roooooaaaaadddd<\/center>\r\n\r\nI wasn't as popular on this engagement, but the only ones listening to the band were those peoples' friends, so I couldn't expect them to be too high on my addition.\r\n\r\nI vaguely recollect shots of Jameson's before we left.  That was probably a bad idea.\r\n\r\nWe got to our hotel around 2:00 (I would guess), and had a handful of hours to sleep before the wake up call roused us for our early flight to Denver.  We dragged ourselves out of bed, wet the cotton mouths, and headed to the airport.\r\n\r\nThe flight to Denver was 2 1\/2 hours, and I was able to get fitful, sweat-soaked, middle-seat sleep all the way there.  By the time we landed, picked up luggage, and got the rental car, I was feeling close to normal.\r\n\r\nLike most travelers on a budget, we had this shitty little American car, built too low to the ground without any buffer to the road noise.  Our destination was Boulder, and we took the toll road away from the airport and toward Boulder.  By this time, we were very thirsty and half-starved.  Also, Mrs. theskinnyonbenny's glasses were broken, so they didn't sit on her head quite right.\r\n\r\nThe 40-minute drive to Boulder turned out to be through a bunch of hilly farmland.  We bypassed one Wendy's, thinking that like Louisiana, every exit would have a McDonald's.  But Ronald hasn't made the inroads in rural Colorado that he has in the rural Southeast.  We arrived in Boulder still hungry, still thirsty, out of breath from the altitude, and in Mrs. theskinnyonbenny's case, carsick.\r\n\r\nI looked for a guy to repair the glasses, but no place was open on a Saturday in downtown Boulder.  By the time I got back to the room, we had to leave the hotel to make our 1:00 appointment.\r\n\r\nThat appointment kept us until around 5:00 that evening.  There were some snacks layed out in the conference room we were in, and I'm sure all of the other people in that room remember us as \"That couple who drank all of the diet cokes and ate enough potato chips for ten people.\"  There was a little reception at that point.  We stayed as short a time as politeness would allow, and made our way out.\r\n\r\nOn the way back to the hotel, there was a brew-pub whose menu included deep dish pizza and chicken wings, so we took our fill of beer, wings, and pizza, and went back to the hotel.  The hotel had a happening bar, and Mrs. theskinnyonbenny was keen to get down there and socialize, but I hit the bed and was asleep in minutes.  It might not have even been 8:00 yet.\r\n\r\n<table cellpadding=\"2\" align=\"right\"><tr><td width=\"5\" rowspan=\"2\"><spacer type=\"block\" width=\"5\" height=\"1\"><\/td><td width=\"250\" ><img src=\"http:\/\/theskinnyonbenny.com\/img\/gal\/025%20-%20Colorado%20-%20Dec%202006\/resPicture036.jpg\" width=\"280\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td class=\"caption\" width=\"250\">Porcupine<\/td><\/tr><\/table>\r\n\r\nI woke up bright-eyed and bushy tailed, only to find that downtown Boulder also lacks a place to get coffee and a newspaper at 4:30 AM.\r\n\r\nThe next afternoon, we drove back out to the Beaver Creek resort where we had gone for our anniversary last fall.  On Sunday night, we went to the bar to watch the Saints\/Cowboys game.  I never knew how popular a destination Colorado was for Texans, but the place was crawling with them.  Even through the Saints fans were severely outnumbered, what could have been the best Saints offensive game in the history of their franchise kept the Cowboys fans mostly quiet.\r\n\r\nIndulge if you will another quick tangent:  I read today that Stats, Inc. tracks incomplete passes in more detail.  They talley drops by the receiver vs. thrown away on purpose vs. plain old bad passes by the quarterback.  It will surprise no one who knows Devry Henderson as \"cement hands\" to know that Drew Brees has the lowest number of plain old bad passes in the league.  The article where I saw this was before Sunday's debacle against the Redskins, but I think the stat would hold up over the season.\r\n\r\nGetting back to Colorado, I learned something interesting in that particular bar:  The good guys come from the southeast.  There was a small fraction of the people there that I liked, and it turned out that they tended to have connections to the SEC.  We met a nice couple who had an Ole Miss - Mississippi State intermarriage, and a Texan couple who were Alabama graduates, and they were all super-friendly.\r\n\r\nThe rest of my trip doesn't make for a very interesting tale.  I spent a day at the spa, but didn't get the super-naked mud wrap like I described last year.  Rocky Mountain oysters had been removed from the menu, although I did see a guy shucking oysters of the more traditional type.  We saw an honest-to-goodness wild porcupine, albeit one that had been tamed with restaurant scraps, and we took a ride up the mountain in an open-air sled, going back down the mountain riding shotgun in a heavy snow-grooming type of tractor.  That part was kind of cool.\r\n\r\nJust as it did on our previous trip, we got a moderate snowstorm as it was time to drive back to Denver.  Driving up and down the mountains on slick interstate made me tense, undoing the nice relaxed neck that had carried over from my spa day.  \r\n\r\nOnce we got back to New Orleans, the fog was so thick that you couldn't see the terminal building from the plane.  More neck tension.  Am I the only one who has ever driven through a snowstorm and a dense Louisiana fog in a four-hour span?\r\n\r\nAs soon as we were too far from Baton Rouge to turn back, I realized that I had left my good camera at home, so I didn't take too many photos.  But they're posted in <a onclick=\"window.open('\/pg3.php?spgmGal=025%20-%20Colorado%20-%20Dec%202006','025ColoradoDec2006','width=1024, height=768, toolbar=no, location = no, directories=no, menubar=no, resizable=yes, scrollbars=no');\">their own small collection<\/a> now.\r\n\r\n"

		"post_content" : "As I mentioned in my previous post, I've been out and about a ton lately.  I spent the week of December 4 away from the office, on a rather dull work trip.  It was four straight days of meetings, and through almost all of it, I was talking or people were paying attention to me.  (That might seem natural to you if you don't do a lot of meetings in corporate America.  In reality, most meetings require you to only pay about 35-40 percent of your attention.)\r\n\r\nI normally make a lot of notes so that I remember the funny things that might have happened while at a client's site.  But all I had written from this trip were the statistics from a meeting on Wednesday morning:\r\n<!--more-->\r\n<blockquote>RBC Meeting 12\/6\/06\r\n\r\nFacial hair demographics:\r\n\r\n8 Goatees\r\n9 Clean shaves\r\n1 Full beard\r\n1 Bushy 'stache with a soul patch\r\n1 Female\r\n<\/blockquote>\r\n\r\nJust for the record, a lot -- but by no means all -- of the goatees belonged to bald or balding men.  The beard was worn by a stereotypical bearded technical systems architect type, and the bushy 'stache\/soul patch guy was a super-nice guy from one of the other vendors.  The female never spoke during this meeting (and it was the only one she attended), and we didn't talk afterwards.\r\n\r\nAlmost all of the other people there were representing other vendors who have a stake in the project.  The meetings went on all day, and then we would see the exact same people for happy hour back at the hotel.  One night, the two of us from my office went to the Outback Steakhouse next door for a beer, and ran into some of the others that we had gotten to know.  They were in with a couple of ladies from their company who were in town for the same client, but on a project unrelated to ours.\r\n\r\nWe joined them at a table and swapped war stories for an hour or so.  Then, one of the ladies -- quick as a cat -- snagged the salt and pepper shakers from the table and dropped them into her purse.  It was so smooth, I didn't notice, and I was the one sitting directly across from her.\r\n\r\nA couple of the others at the table laughed at her, and asked, \"What the hell was that?\" but she didn't really answer, and no one came right out and testified to what they had witnessed.\r\n\r\nSo that was kind of wierd.\r\n\r\nWe got back to Baton Rouge on Thursday night, and I came in the house, dropped off my luggage, and turned around to leave for Lutcher.  Thursday was the night of the bonfire festival, and we had tickets to see 80s icons Loverboy play that night.\r\n\r\nWe got to the event too late to actually see a bonfire, but we rolled into a big barn where a stage was set up at one end.  The sides of the barn were blocked with vinyl sheets to keep out the cold, and without them, it would have been unbearably cold that night.  \r\n\r\nWhen we got there, Randy Jackson of Zebra was performing solo, with an acoustic guitar.  He played a bunch of classic rock hits -- some Beatles, Stones, Pink Floyd, a little Zeppelin, etc.  He was surprisingly good.  There were numbers where you would have thought  that there were two guitars playing, as much music as he got to come out of his single instrument.  He wasn't the best singer in the world, but then again, he wasn't bad.  And like I said, he could play the shit out of his guitar.\r\n\r\nBy the way, Zebra has two hits that I promise you know, and a handful of others that had short MTV runs in the 80s.  I'm not going to try to describe them in text or hunt down relevant links for you tonight, but search Zebra from Itunes, and sort the results by relevance.  You'll remember.\r\n\r\n<table cellpadding=\"2\" align=\"right\"><tr><td width=\"5\" rowspan=\"2\"><spacer type=\"block\" width=\"5\" height=\"1\"><\/td><td width=\"250\" ><img src=\"\/img\/gal\/024 - Loverboy in Lutcher\/resPicture009.jpg\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td class=\"caption\" width=\"250\">Steve's new shirt.<\/td><\/tr><\/table>\r\n\r\nToward the end of his set, Randy mentioned that Zebra t-shirts were for sale at one of the booths at the back of the barn, which sent Steve high-tailing it away from us like we had set his ass on fire.  Jackson wasn't even done with his sentence, and Steve was long gone without a word to any of us.  He returned by the end of the next song with his prize.\r\n\r\nAfter a brief intermission, during which Steve befriended a cowboy who looked like Wyatt Earp and during which I was educated on the status of local high school football by a coon-ass, Loverboy took the stage to roughly 250 of their biggest fans in South Louisiana.  They played a long show; it lasted at least an hour if I had to guess.  I had expected what I normally see from the 80s stars who continue to tour -- washed up, fat, frog-voiced wannabes, who still belt out the same old tired tunes for a paycheck.\r\n\r\nThe members of Loverboy have added some fat over the years.  But I was truly shocked to get a show from talented musicians.  It turns out that they had a bunch of hits in the 80s (not just Working for the Weekend), and I knew most of their set.  And they played really, really well.  I think that they've aged better than comparable 80s group Duran Duran, who we saw at the end of October.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the show, I found that my friends were just as surprised by the level of talent, and I declared that this was probably the best rock-and-roll performance to have taken place in a barn in Lutcher, Louisiana EVER.  You heard right.  We witnessed history.\r\n\r\nDriving down the rural highway on the way home, I got pulled over going 80.  The speed limit was 65.  The officer had me get out of the car and move to the back.  I answered his questions about how many others were in the car, and that we had no weapons.  He checked my eyeballs for signs of drunkenness, which were thankfully absent.\r\n\r\nHe had me go around to the passenger side to get the registration certificate and the proof of insurance.  He was right behind me when the door opened, and Mrs. theskinnyonbenny handed me the papers with a single comment.  \"Dickhead.\"\r\n\r\nFortunately for me, he either didn't hear, or thought that she was addressing me rather than talking about the officer.  As soon as he confirmed over the radio that I wasn't some sort of wanted criminal, he told me to slow down and sent me on my way.\r\n\r\nI just about kissed him on the lips, but then considered that this might be another crime.\r\n\r\nI have <a onclick=\"window.open('\/pg3.php?spgmGal=024%20-%20Loverboy%20in%20Lutcher','024LoverboyinLutcher','width=1024, height=768, toolbar=no, location = no, directories=no, menubar=no, resizable=yes, scrollbars=no');\" onmouseover=\"chgImg ('i024LoverboyinLutcher','img024LoverboyinLutcherRed');\" onmouseout=\"chgImg ('i024LoverboyinLutcher','img024LoverboyinLutcher');\" >more pictures posted<\/a> from the Lutcher scene.

The web site acts like it's a major benefit in your quest to survive a hurricane, complete with scary Katrina photographs, which were undoubtedly ripped off from other web sites.  You'll notice that the orange box appears in none of the pictures, so by implication, it's the lack of a box that left these good people in such a pickle.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tThe site points out that you can slip a padlock on it (whooooo!), put a sticker with your name on it, so that it won't get lost, and that it is \"water resistant,\" which is not the same as \"water proof.\"  Any boater will tell you that \"water resistant\" means that you have a few minutes to wipe a spill off the surface, but that any repeated splashing will soak the contents but good.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tDon't confuse the Orange Boxx with <i>The Orange BoXXX<\/i>, which was a 1978 pornographic film about a woman with oddly-colored private areas.\r\n\r\n\t\tThis is a good example of what happens when you let any old shit-for-brains start his own web page.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t(And by \"this,\" I mean <a href=\"http:\/\/www.orangeboxx.com\/\">www.orangeboxx.com<\/a>, not thesknnyonbenny.com.)\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<b>$$<\/b> Fifty bucks, for the large orange boxx.\r\n\t<\/td>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n\t<td colspan=\"2\">\r\n\t\t<table cellpadding=\"2\" align=\"left\"><tr><td width=\"250\" ><img src=\"http:\/\/theskinnyonbenny.com\/img\/xmas\/06\/gavemyword.jpg\"><\/td><td width=\"5\" rowspan=\"2\"><spacer type=\"block\" width=\"5\" height=\"1\"><\/td><\/tr><\/table>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<h3>The \"I Gave My Word\" Shirt<\/h3>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tThis shirt has it all.

Usually. In the spring, I was wearing my four-year-old pair of Blundstone boots at a joint on Manhattanâ€™s Lower East Side. The worn-supple black leather was laced with battle scars. A few days earlier, I'd snugged them into gaiters and stomped through snowdrifts in the Rockies. A few days later, I would sit in a chair in Grand Central and have them shined back to life before meeting with some corporate types.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tMy friend Drew wore his Blundstones on\ta six week trip across Eastern Europe, where he trekked through the Carpathian Mountains and suffered spilled Czechvars in dingy pubs. That was six years ago; currently, heâ€™s wearing the same pair on vacation in the Scottish Highlands.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tThen thereâ€™s my friend Josiah, who destroys everything he owns. Looking at the pulverized shoes he discards after a single season, you'd think he'd attack them with power tools. His first Blundstones endured an astonishing three years, and he keeps them in the closet still, like a trophy. \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tI've worn mine with jeans, a suit, and board shorts (OK, the latter was a stretch); on bikes, horses, and basketball courts. I've never owned a more faithful thing. And yet here I am cheating. Why? company Because this fall, the introduced the Blundstone 550, a boot with a soft leather liner that, as promised, has molded to fit my feet even better than my first pair. And because the 550 has a bouncy rubber-and-plastic sole that makes my heels feel caffeinated. But mostly itâ€™s because I wanted a pair in brown.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<\/blockquote>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tWow!  Right?  Until you go check their <a href=\"http:\/\/www.blundstoneusa.com\/grp_550.asp\r\n\t\t\">web site<\/a>, and find the ugly-ass shoe pictured here.  What the hell?  No wonder Dew was spilling Carpathian Czechvars all over them.  He was hoping they would fall apart.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t(But still, I want to try them out.  Who wouldn't want caffeinated heels?)\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<b>$$$<\/b> One hundred-sixty bucks.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t<\/td>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n\t<td colspan=\"2\">\r\n\t\t<table cellpadding=\"2\" align=\"left\"><tr><td width=\"250\" ><img src=\"http:\/\/theskinnyonbenny.com\/img\/xmas\/06\/klassic2.jpg\"><\/td><td width=\"5\" rowspan=\"2\"><spacer type=\"block\" width=\"5\" height=\"1\"><\/td><\/tr><\/table>\r\n\r\n\t\t<h3>The Xylon Klassic bicycle<\/h3>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tLook at this.

What could be better.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tWhen I was a kid, my family had a big coffee-table book of New Yorker cartoons in one of the bathrooms.  I bet every single one of us read every single cartoon dozens of times -- almost all of which occurred while taking a dump.  I only remember a couple.  They were the ones with cuss words.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tSince I remembered the captions entirely, I had no problem finding them on <a href=\"http:\/\/cartoonbank.com\">cartoonbank.com<\/a>.

They are often as awesome as the smart-ass comments that go with them.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tI started to add additional links to all of the posters that are hilarious to me because they're true to me.  But there's only so much disk space on the internet.  If you fail to look at all of the possible demotivators, then you are doing yourself a disservice.

Mostly, these are husbands who bought their wives chainsaws for their birthdays earlier this year, and subsequently got bitched out because they bought presents that were, \"Really for you -- not for me!\"\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tTrust me ladies.  If your husband buys you the apple pot, he's not just saying that you need another junky piece of kitchen clutter.  He's actually saying that he loves you so much, that he can't bear to eat another grain of rice that was boiled in a normal pot.  If you're going to take your well-deserved kitchen time to cook for your husband, you might just as well have a kitschy, fun little pot to bring a smile to your suppertime preparations.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<b>$<\/b> Twenty-five bucks.\r\n\t<\/td>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n\t<td colspan=\"2\">\r\n\t\t<table cellpadding=\"2\" align=\"left\"><tr><td width=\"250\" ><img src=\"http:\/\/theskinnyonbenny.com\/img\/xmas\/06\/ride.jpg\"><\/td><td width=\"5\" rowspan=\"2\"><spacer type=\"block\" width=\"5\" height=\"1\"><\/td><\/tr><\/table>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<h3>The Daddle<\/h3>\r\n\r\n\t\tPlease tell me that I don't need to make fun of the Daddle.\r\n\r\n\t\tActually, I guess I might.  I think that I know guys who might actually order one of these.\r\n\r\n\t\tYou might think that your little kid thinks you're the bomb because you ordered a Daddle, but you would be wrong.  Your kid doesn't really care if you have a fake-saddle or not.  But this is assured:  if you have one of these, your child will despise you as a teenager.  And that said, I can't come to your defense.  You deserve the despise.\r\n\r\n\t\tLet me put this offer out there now.  First dad who emails me a picture of you wearing this gayest of all products -- I'll send you a check for fifty bucks.  It's just like getting a free Daddle, but I get to make fun of you!\r\n\r\n\t\tHere's another offer.  If you're a teenager whose parents had one of these, be the first to send me a picture, and I'll send you fifty bucks.  This offer does not expire, so if you're reading this in 2019, send it on in.  Fifty dollars will probably still buy you a candy bar!\r\n\r\n\t\t\"As Seen on The Tonight Show With Jay Leno\"\r\n\r\n\t\tDoes anyone think that Leno was pushing this product?  Or was he actually making fun of it?  'Nuff said.\r\n\r\n\t\tSpeaking of Leno, here's an aside.\r\n\r\n\t\tSome years ago, during a Las Vegas trip, our friend Crystal started badgering Mrs. theskinnyonbenny about what a big fan of Jay Leno she had been in high school.  Mrs. theskinnyonbenny contended that she was not inordinately fanatic about Leno, but Crystal is the type to harp and harp and harp until she pisses you off, or until you give in.\r\n\r\n\t\tMrs. theskinnyonbenny always gets pissed off.  She never gives in.\r\n\r\n\t\tSo Mrs. theskinnyonbenny was completely angry, and Crystal kept going on and on and on about Jay Leno.  I don't understand why either of them was quite so adamant, but the brouhaha lasted a couple of days.  We still don't bring this up to this day.\r\n\r\n\t\tMrs. theskinnyonbenny will be pissed just in reading this recounting of the story.  So to balance that out, I'll remind everyone that Crystal <a href=\"http:\/\/theskinnyonbenny.com\/x\/Crystal.php\"> cried on the Oprah Winfrey show<\/a>.  Watch and have another laugh at her expense.\r\n\r\n\t\t(Note -- I just watched this again for the first time in a year or two, and I'm all by myself in a hotel room, having a hardy laugh out loud, all by myself.)\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t<b>$$<\/b> 50 bucks (way too much).\r\n\t<\/td>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n\t<td colspan=\"2\">\r\n\t\t<table cellpadding=\"2\" align=\"left\"><tr><td width=\"250\" ><img src=\"http:\/\/theskinnyonbenny.com\/img\/xmas\/06\/bilde.jpg\"><\/td><td width=\"5\" rowspan=\"2\"><spacer type=\"block\" width=\"5\" height=\"1\"><\/td><\/tr><\/table>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<h3>A Case of Santa's Butt Winter Porter<\/h3>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/www.indystar.com\/apps\/pbcs.dll\/article?AID=\/20061203\/LOCAL17\/612030470\/-1\/ZONES04\">Various governments -- always looking out for we stoopid citzen hoo cant look after weselves -- are banning this beer<\/a>, which might be the best thing or the worst thing ever to happen to this particular brewer.

Wilson is (I gather) a dull little down around a half hour south of Rocky Mount, NC.  Rocky Mount is a fairly dull town around an hour from Raleigh.  But right there -- an hour and a half from the nearest city that you've heard of -- is a wildly popular eatery.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tThe drill at Beefmastor's is that you show up, and find that the wait at a small hole-in-the-wall restaurant is crazy long.  So you open an ice chest of beer and start to wait.  How did you know to bring an ice chest of beer?  Everyone just knows.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tI'm in Rocky Mount this week, and all of the consultants from all over the nation know to bring beer and plan to tailgate in the parking lot of Beefmastor's.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tOnce you get in, you have a small choice in what you get to eat.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tSome guy brings buy a huge slab of beef, and you point to where you want him to cut a piece off for your dinner.  It comes back to you on a plate, cooked medium.  As far as I know, that's all there is to it.  For sure, there are no menus.  Perhaps there are sides, but no other meat choices.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tI didn't make it there myself, much to my regret.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<b>$<\/b> I don't think this is a high-dollar joint.\r\n\t<\/td>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n\r\n<\/table>\r\n\r\n"

They had free access to the underside of the house in the back yard.  All they needed to do was bust the lattice that covers the underside of the house up front, and they were free as birds.\r\n<!--more-->\r\nWhen Lily was a puppy, an invisible fence helpedme to convince her that this wasn't a viable alternative.  I had the wire run underneath the house, making a line  that approximates where the front yard meets the back.  She figured out pretty fast not to go near the wire.\r\n\r\nBlossom came later, and she's a natural follower.  I thought that I could put a shock collar on her, and all would continue to be good.  But Blossom is also stupid, and her stupidity worked against me in this case.  When she got shocked, she ran forward -- into the pain -- rather than back away from it.  It only took a couple of tries before she knew that if she ran past the wire line, it wasn't so bad.\r\n\r\n<table cellpadding=\"2\" align=\"right\"><tr><td width=\"5\" rowspan=\"2\"><spacer type=\"block\" width=\"5\" height=\"1\"><\/td><td width=\"250\" ><img src=\"\/img\/gal\/023%20-%20Dog%20Escapes\/resIMG_20061107_0615.JPG\" width=\"235\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td class=\"caption\" width=\"250\">Compromised dog wire and lattice in the back yard.<\/td><\/tr><\/table>\r\n\r\nLily watched and learned, and as of a few weeks ago, my invisible fence was no deterrent at all.\r\n\r\nAfter retrieving them from neighbors a couple of times, I went to Lowe's and bought a roll of dog wire.  My idea was to stretch the wire horizontally across a long gap across the back of the house.  This was their route underneath, and I figured I could close it up, and that would be that.\r\n\r\nIn retrospect, that was a laughably foolish assumption.  They were happy enough to break a dog-sized hole in the lattice in the front of my house, so they were more than happy enough to bust a similar hole in the back yard, but on the other side of my dog wire.  I probably spent four hours on the house to give them a roadblock that held them up half a day or so.\r\n\r\nI put up more wire to keep them from getting to their new hole.  Then, I spent several more hours putting more dog wire under the house in spots where the lattice looked vulnerable.\r\n\r\n<table cellpadding=\"2\" align=\"right\"><tr><td width=\"5\" rowspan=\"2\"><spacer type=\"block\" width=\"5\" height=\"1\"><\/td><td width=\"250\" ><img src=\"\/img\/gal\/023%20-%20Dog%20Escapes\/resIMG_20061107_0614.JPG\" width=\"235\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td class=\"caption\" width=\"250\">The dogs come home worn out.  They immediately hit the couch after I brought them home after one escape.<\/td><\/tr><\/table>\r\n\r\nThat's when they learned that they could bend and break the wire in spots where I didn't have a good spot to steak or nail one part of the wire's border.  I don't know how much time they spent exploring, but they found two or three spots.  We spent a couple of weeks on a drill where they would take advantage of a weakness, then I would fortify the weakness.  In another day or two, they would have found a new spot and be out terrorizing the neighborhood cats once again.  I spent more time crawling under the house that I care to admit.\r\n\r\nLast weekend, I think I found a trump card.  I crawled under the house yet again.  I fortified all of the week spots in my dog wire, and then ran a spool of invisible fence wire across the bottom of it, and going all the way around the house.  Now, they can't put their heads in and work out an opening without shocking themselves repeatedly.\r\n\r\nThis method has worked for a full week, so maybe I've finally won.\r\n\r\nThe complete (but small) collection of photos of their damage is<a onclick=\"window.open('\/pg3.php?spgmGal=023%20-%20Dog%20Escapes','023DogEscapes','width=1024, height=768, toolbar=no, location = no, directories=no, menubar=no, resizable=yes, scrollbars=no');\" onmouseover=\"chgImg ('i023DogEscapes','img023DogEscapesRed');\" onmouseout=\"chgImg ('i023DogEscapes','img023DogEscapes');\" >\r\nhere<\/a>.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

I've never been a fan of Elvis Costello, but I checked the folder with his music anyway.  I had to take a screen shot of the directory.  Every folder here is a complete and different album.\r\n\r\nYou might ask, \"How could one person turn out so much music?\"  Well, Uncle Benny will fill you in.  A sampling of the albums tells me that EC is willing to record every single bar of music that ever comes to his mind.  Better song next week?  No worries, I can always release another record then.\r\n\r\nSo without any sort of self-censorship, the library of crap grows and grows and grows until you have this collection of boring tunes that music snobs can pretend that they like.\r\n\r\n(I just reread this post so far, and I really like this phrase:  \"So without any sort of self-censorship, the library of crap grows and grows and grows.\"  It's much like this blog in that aspect.)\r\n\r\n<center><img src=\"\/img\/greenline.gif\"><\/center>\r\n\r\nSpeaking of interesting musical facts (not that it was all that interesting), a couple of weeks ago, I Googled myself, and found a couple of interesting links that I hadn't seen <a href=\"http:\/\/theskinnyonbenny.com\/blog2\/archives\/182\">before<\/a>.  The most amusing find was a band named after a guy who had the same name as me.\r\n\r\nIt took another few clicks for me to find their CD on sale for $1.99 at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.secondspin.com\/music\/browse-artist.jsp?productId=993855\" target=\"_blank\">SecondSpin.com<\/a>.  That's the cover up there at the top of the post.  A few clicks after that, and I had ordered my own copy.\r\n\r\nIt's worth $1.99 to me just for the CD cover alone.  I shall display it proudly. I have only listened to fits and starts of the music so far, and as you might have guessed, it's not all that great.  It sort of reminds me of that solo album that Jimmy Page put out in the early 90's, but I don't think it's all that good.  I have yet to stumble on a snippet of music that included any vocal part.  But who knows?  I might become a fan yet.\r\n\r\n<table cellpadding=\"2\" align=\"right\"><tr><td width=\"5\" rowspan=\"2\"><spacer type=\"block\" width=\"5\" height=\"1\"><\/td><td width=\"250\" ><img src=\"\/img\/bsb_1.jpg\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td class=\"caption\" width=\"250\">A photo from the CD case of the guy who took my name to the record companies.

I have to admit that I didn't really know that Liz was a real person rather than just a brand name.\r\n\r\n<center><img src=\"\/img\/greenline.gif\"><\/center>\r\n\r\nHere's an email that I got from Shelly a couple of weeks ago.  I'm making the judgment that this is really about me rather than about her life up in New Jersey, so I'm putting it in my own blog rather than making a new page in the ongoing series of pages about Shelly.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Two things happened on the train today that made me think of you:\r\nFirst, a Chinese lady had a walkman -- a real tape playing walkman.  I couldn't believe me eyes. I didn't know any of those were still around.  Second, the man in the seat in front of me had the WORST hair piece you have ever seen.  I mean, it didn't even look like he tried to blend it in.  I don't know why those things made me think of you -- probably b\/c you have an even more warped sense of humor than I do.<\/blockquote>\r\n\r\nI think I know the real reason that the hairpiece guy reminded you of me is that I'm the only one I know who consistently gets annoyed that <a href=\"http:\/\/www.2theadvocate.com\/columnists\/pat\" target=\"_blank\">Baton Rouge meteorologist Pat Shingleton<\/a> doesn't try a little harder to hide the fact that he has a bad, bad hairpiece.  Why oh why doesn't he either get one that blends in with that little bit of real hair on the side, or just go bald?  Seriously Pat, viewers of local news don't care if you have hair on your dome or not.  Sheeze.\r\n\r\n<center><img src=\"\/img\/greenline.gif\"><\/center>\r\n\r\nI don't know who made up this haiku.  It was recited to me, and if the source was revealed, I didn't take note.  Nevertheless, it was good enough to pass on.\r\n\r\n<center>Haikus are easy.\r\nBut some of them don't make sense.\r\nRefrigerator.<\/center>\r\n\r\n<center><img src=\"\/img\/greenline.gif\"><\/center>\r\n\r\nOne day recently, I was playing a pickup game of basketball during my lunch time.  There were about five us from the office, all white and uncoordinated and tired from the first couple of games that we played.  We invited three fresh young tall black guys to join for four-on-four, and any sane person would have guessed that they would have been the three best players on the court.\r\n\r\nIn fact, they probably were, but I took the job of guarding one of the tall athletic guys.  Again, the betting man would have given short odds on my opponent scoring at will.  But as it turned out, I held him to only a couple of buckets, and I think both of those came when I had rolled off to cover someone else.\r\n\r\nMy moment of glory came as he launched a shot from behind the 3-point arc.  I jumped up, tipped the ball, and grabed it out of the air.  I don't know if that gets scored as a block or a steal, but I'm giving myself credit for both.\r\n\r\nI turned quickly and looked for a teammate to be open under the goal.  And I saw a guy -- a big target standing near no one at all, right under the basket.  I flung the perfect pass right to him.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the ball had left my hand, I realized that the open guy was also on the other team.  My steal had been for nothing.  \r\n\r\nMy moment of glory lasted approximately 0.35 seconds.\r\n\r\n"

		"post_content" : "Last weekend, we got to New Orleans on Saturday afternoon. Mrs. theskinnyonbenny and I sat in a bar talking to the tourists from Baltimore and keeping an eye on the football games while we waited for our friends to arrive.  We walked around the French Quarter in the evening, and once it was dark, went on one of those haunted house walking tours.\r\n\r\nOur tour guide was a chipper octogenarian in a witch costume who called herself \"Scary Mary.\"  She was knowledgeable about the history of the town and of its old houses, but she wasn't at all scary.  She is probably a good guide for the walking tours most of the year, but she wasn't too good for the haunted tour.\r\n<!--more-->\r\nFor example, at the LaLaurie house, she gave us the story -- which I had heard -- where Madame LaLaurie was seen chasing a slave girl off the roof, and how the society people looked the other way to get into her lavish parties.  One day her house caught fire, and in trying to save her stuff, her friends and neighbors found an attic where she tortured the slaves.\r\n\r\nI was picturing a room where she administered beatings and maybe subjected the slaves to intense attic heat or food deprivation.  That would be bad enough, but Jodie had done a similar tour before, and she knew of the more gruesome details.  I came back to the plugged in world this week, and found that <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Delphine_LaLaurie\" target=\"_blank\">the Wikipedia article<\/a> had the graphic details.  I recommend the read.\r\n\r\nThere was another spooky topic that kept recurring during the weekend.  There was this guy a few weeks ago who couldn't deal with the stresses in his life any more.  One such stress was his nagging girlfriend (who also looks crazy in the pictures), and he ended up killing her.  Not content to stop there, he chopped her into pieces, and tried to cook her up for a meal.  Then, he checked into a hotel, partied like a rock star until his money ran out, and capped it off by committing suicide from the roof.  It's obviously an intriguing story, which is best described in the 2nd and 3rd stories on <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nola.com\/newslogs\/tpupdates\/index.ssf?\/mtlogs\/nola_tpupdates\/archives\/2006_10_18.html\" target=\"_blank\">this page<\/a>.\r\n\r\nThe French Quarter isn't that big, but we kept finding ourselves in the setting for this story.  We ducked into a bar after the tour and found ourselves -- quite by coincidence -- in the Royal Omni, where he took the dive off of the roof.  We also spotted the house where they lived while driving to the Voodoo Fest on Sunday morning.  And I had no idea until I googled Buffa's (see previous post) after I returned home, that this is where they guy hung out and worked.\r\n\r\n<table cellpadding=\"2\" align=\"right\"><tr><td width=\"5\" rowspan=\"2\"><spacer type=\"block\" width=\"5\" height=\"1\"><\/td><td width=\"250\" ><img src=\"\/img\/mychemical.jpg\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td class=\"caption\" width=\"250\">My Chemical Romance performs at Voodoo Fest<\/td><\/tr><\/table>\r\n\r\nPerv mentioned that in a comment on that post, and there was one other comment that made me remember something else about that place:\r\n\r\n<blockquote>the picture reminds me of how Greg Brady (of Brady Bunch fame) decorated his room when he got to move into his dadâ€™s old office! Was there a lava lamp? <\/blockquote>\r\n\r\nAwesome observation there.  I had mentioned the caution tape meant to keep you out of the kitchen, but I forgot to provide the fact that it was hanging down vertically, just like those beads that you had to walk through to get into the main part of Greg Brady's attic room.\r\n\r\nGetting back to the New Orleans trip, we had just a perfect day on Sunday.  Mrs. theskinnyonbenny and I started our morning by splitting a bottle of champagne in a courtyard.  The weather was beautiful:  cool in the shade, warm in the sun, not a cloud in the sky.  We paid up, and I left the restaurant with a satisfying buzz.\r\n\r\nAfter our champagne breakfast, we moved down the road for a brunch.  I stuck with champagne as I chowed on a big plate of french toast.\r\n\r\nAfter that, we got cash and headed out to the Voodoo Fest.  I managed to maintain a buzz without sobering up, running out of gas, or getting schnockered through the entire day.  It's a rare feat to be able to balance one's drinking that perfectly from 10:00 AM to midnight.\r\n\r\n<table cellpadding=\"2\" align=\"left\"><tr><td width=\"250\" ><img src=\"\/img\/champ_breakfast.jpg\"><\/td><td width=\"5\" rowspan=\"2\"><spacer type=\"block\" width=\"5\" height=\"1\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td class=\"caption\" width=\"250\">Champagne breakfast<\/td><\/tr><\/table>\r\n\r\nOver the course of the day, we saw a lot of good to very good music, but nothing that just blew my socks off.  This gets kind of boring, so I'll be quick.\r\n\r\n<b>Pete Yorn:<\/b>  Played all of his songs that you know, sounded very good.  The afternoon sun was in our face, and the crowd quite small at this point, but I liked it a lot.\r\n\r\n<b>Jack's Mannequin:<\/b>  I had never heard of this band, but got drawn in as I went to look to buy a $4 beer.  They weren't super talented, but they were enthusiastic, and I enjoyed the band a lot.\r\n\r\n<b>My Chemical Romance:<\/b>  This is who I wanted to see most, and musically, it was definitely the pinnacle of the day for me.  The sun was behind the stage by then, and they played straight through for an excellent hour.  The crowd was still sparse, and Mrs. theskinnyonbenny and I seemed to be the only old people with enough liquor in us to jump around and enjoy it a lot.\r\n\r\n<b>The Flaming Lips:<\/b>  They put on a weird show, with lots of confetti and balloons and effects.  One side of the stage had a bunch of dancing chicks who were dressed up like space aliens and one side had a bunch of people dancing who were dressed like Santa Claus.  Unfortunately, the aliens never fought the Santas.  The music was so-so.  It turns out I'm not a huge fan.  But they did have a couple of songs I had heard before, although they saved those for the very end of the set.\r\n\r\n<table cellpadding=\"2\" align=\"right\"><tr><td width=\"5\" rowspan=\"2\"><spacer type=\"block\" width=\"5\" height=\"1\"><\/td><td width=\"250\" ><img src=\"\/img\/voodoo_lights.jpg\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td class=\"caption\" width=\"250\">Duran Duran asked the crowd to open their cell phones during a slower song, in order to \"Give us some starlight.\"  This is a shot of the starlight.<\/td><\/tr><\/table>\r\n\r\n<b>Duran Duran:<\/b>  By the time Duran Duran started, there was a pretty good and enthusiastic crowd.  They sounded just like they do on their recordings, but they are starting to look a bit old and fat.  They played for over an hour and were pretty entertaining.  It was fun to see that the young kids had no familiarity with these songs, as opposed to the songs that they knew pretty well on the earlier acts.\r\n\r\n<b>Cowboy Mouth:<\/b>  We stopped by the last stage still playing for local band Cowboy Mouth, who shared their stage with lots of older New Orleans funk players.  It was the same old stuff that Baton Rougeans have heard them play many times.  I wonder how tired the band must be of their two local hits, as I'm pretty tired of them too.\r\n\r\nSo after that, we made a long walk to the car, then to Buffa's.  You know the story from there."

I had been talking off and on for at least an hour about how I was looking forward to one of their potatoes (yes, really).  But we got there, and it was packed to overflowing.  It seemed a long shot to get four spots at the bar near each other, and they only have 8 or 10 tables, so it was going to be a long, long time before we got to eat.\r\n<!--more-->\r\n<table cellpadding=\"2\" align=\"right\"><tr><td width=\"5\" rowspan=\"2\"><spacer type=\"block\" width=\"5\" height=\"1\"><\/td><td width=\"250\" ><img src=\"\/img\/buffas_steve.jpg\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td class=\"caption\" width=\"250\">Steve enjoys a Buffaburger in front of the shopping cart and a <i>Casablanca<\/i> movie poster.<\/td><\/tr><\/table>\r\n\r\nWe walked back to a place that we had passed on our way over to Port of Call.  <a href=\"http:\/\/listings.bestofneworleans.com\/gyrobase\/Location.html?Location=oid%3A10331\" target=\"_blank\">Buffa's<\/a> is right across Esplanade Blvd.  \r\n\r\nWe walked in to a smallish bar area.  A long bar took up the space on the left, and a few small tables were on the right.  The bartender was a big energetic guy.  He was friendly, but kind of crazy as well.  He looked like an American Indian with long straight hair, but he could have been white, Hispanic, or Asian too.\r\n\r\nHe went back to check whether the kitchen was open for us.  (It was after 10:00 on Sunday by now.)  He came back to report that we could eat, but that we couldn't have anything well-done.  The cook had a bus to catch.\r\n\r\nThe menu was a list on a chalkboard that looked something like this:\r\n\r\n<center>Hamburger\r\nCheeseburger\r\nBuffaburger\r\n(about two other items, which seemed unappealing)<\/center>\r\n\r\nJodie ordered first.  \"I'll have a cheeseburger.\"\r\n\r\n\"You want a Buffaburger.\"  It was said more as a statement than a question.\r\n\r\n\"OK, sure.\"\r\n\r\nWe each took a turn ordering Buffaburgers and drinks.\r\n\r\n<table cellpadding=\"2\" align=\"right\"><tr><td width=\"5\" rowspan=\"2\"><spacer type=\"block\" width=\"5\" height=\"1\"><\/td><td width=\"250\" ><img src=\"\/img\/buffas_tinman.jpg\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td class=\"caption\" width=\"250\">An uneven window in the back room at Buffas.

There was a small group of people in there, and it was very comfortable.  If I lived in that neighborhood, I would be in there all the time.\r\n\r\nSomeone or other came back from the restroom to report that there was a whole separate room in the back.  We walked back to find a decent sized table.\r\n\r\nThis was the strangest room that I've seen in any bar.\r\n\r\nThere were two long tables lined up in parallel -- high school cafeteria style.  It featured water damaged ceilings and old movie posters.  There was a pool table and a ping pong table set up at weird angles, but with plenty of room to play.  This was a large room.\r\n\r\nThere was a dart board on one wall, but bags of trash were piled underneath it. The kitchen had an open door, but yellow Caution tape warned patrons against venturing in.\r\n\r\nOne corner of the room had an old television (that would probably have changed channels with a manual knob twist with a satisfying chunk-chunk-chunk as it turned) atop a cigarette machine.  Facing it was a setup with a sofa, large table with a flower arrangement, and several chairs.  It was a little living room.\r\n\r\nEven though the lighting was fine, the room was accessorized by several brass lamps.  There was also a \"help yourself\" bookshelf full of paperbacks.\r\n\r\n<table cellpadding=\"2\" align=\"left\"><tr><td width=\"250\" ><img src=\"\/img\/buffas_wide.jpg\"><\/td><td width=\"5\" rowspan=\"2\"><spacer type=\"block\" width=\"5\" height=\"1\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td class=\"caption\" width=\"250\">The \"TV on a cigarette machine area\" in the back room.

Oh yes, there was a shopping cart in one corner.  And the windows (long and oval-shaped) weren't parallel with the ground or ceiling.\r\n\r\nWe sat at one of the cafeteria tables, slack-jawed at our surroundings while we waited for our Buffaburgers.  The Indian-looking guy eventually came out of the kitchen door balancing four plates on his arms.  His voice started as soon as he appeared, and he made noise all the way across to our table.\r\n\r\n\"AAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHH.\"  As he set down the food, he added a flourish.  \"Muthuhfuckerrrrrrrrsssss.\"\r\n\r\nThis surprised my companions and left them responseless.  But I had heard him refer to some of the other patrons as motherfuckers, so I was a little more prepared.  Still, what is the correct response?

Lots of country music writers out there with heartache.\r\n\r\nSo how do I make sure that I listen to all of the songs?\r\n<!--more-->\r\nI have a playlist on my ipod that gives me all of the songs that I haven't rated.  They're sorted alphabetically, and I just start playing at the start of the list when I'm in the mood to make progress on this little project.  As I hear a song, I select a rating for them.  This gives me the added benefit of having ratings associated with songs, which I can then use to build other playlists (for example, \"Give me all of the songs by Shaggy with 4 stars or better.\"  or \"Give me all of the one star songs, except for those by Barbara Striesand or Bette Midler.\")\r\n\r\nFor the sake of full disclosure, I have both Barbara Striesand and Bette Midler in my music library.  I keep them off of the actual ipod.  They got there because Mrs. theskinnyonbenny borrowed the entire CD library from our friend Stacie, and ripped them all to disk with no censorship at all.  This action accounts for 75% of what I would generously refer to as \"crap\" in my music collection.\r\n\r\nThank the Lord, \"Heartbeat\" by Wham! just completed playing as I was typing this.  I force myself to have the discipline to listen to each song all the way through.  It is very very very likely that I will never listen to this song all the way through ever again.\r\n\r\nI use the following guidelines for my ratings.\r\n\r\n\r\n<table align=\"center\" border=\"1\">\r\n\r\n<tr>\r\n\t<td align=\"center\">*<\/td>\r\n\t<td>One star is reserved for the truly God-awful.  A song has to be almost comically bad to be rated as one star.  The Wham! song referred to above is the first song that I've rated as one star in a long, long time.  I also use this for non-songs, like the little spoken interludes that rappers are so fond of sticking into their albums.<\/td>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n\r\n<tr>\r\n\t<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\">**<\/td>\r\n\t<td>This one is reserved for the generally bad.  It's a pretty big category.  Neil Diamond is currently singing his rendition of Heartbreak Hotel in my ears.  This one will get a two.<\/td>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n\r\n<tr>\r\n\t<td align=\"center\">***<\/td>\r\n\t<td>This is a big category reserved for generally good songs.  It's probably the largest category of them all.  When I get to Elvis's Heartbreak Hotel, it will probably go here.<\/td>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n\r\n<tr>\r\n\t<td align=\"center\">****<\/td>\r\n\t<td>This is for really really good songs.  My guideline is that if it's a song that makes you reach to turn up the volume or rewind when it's done so you can hear it again, then it should get a four.  Willie Nelson's version of Heartbreak Hotel didn't quite make the cut.\r\n\t\r\nThe most recent 4-star song I hit was \"Heart In a Cage\" by The Strokes.  I had to give that some consideration, because I couldn't decide if it was legitimately a 4-star song, or if it just seemed like one because it followed Olivia Newton-John's \"Heart Attack.\"<\/td>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n\r\n<tr>\r\n\t<td align=\"center\">*****<\/td>\r\n\t<td>Five star songs are the best of the best.  I can't remember the last time that I used up a five on a song.  I don't need to provide examples here.  You all know what music gets you going -- the songs that you immediately crank up when you're alone and in a bad mood, the songs that gave you chills the first times you heard them, the ones that make you remember awesome times when you were young and free, or the ones that you've listened to at your desk 50,000 times.  \r\n\t\r\nOf course everybody's five-star list would be different, and everybody's list is correct -- for them.  Unless they put Bette Midler in there.  Then they're just a fools.\r\n\t\r\nI will give you one five-star tidbit from my library:  any time I get any new sound equipment, be it a pair of headphones, a new stereo, a new car, or whatever, U2's \"Where the Streets Have No Name\" is <i>always<\/a> the first tune that gets played.  That's my little ritual.<\/td>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n<\/table>\r\n\r\n"

I was assigned a class of 7th graders at a school right down the street from my house.  \r\n\r\nAll of the junior high stereotypes were in full play:  the boys who were too cool to participate, the class clowns, the smart pretty girl who kissed my butt.  From what I saw, very little has changed in the junior high classroom in the last 20 years.\r\n<!--more-->\r\nThe material I was supposed to go over with the kids was about how immigration in the 1800s led to such huge population growth, and to a lesser extent, how adding all those workers to the economy was the first step to our nation's prosperity.\r\n\r\nWe covered the impact of immigrants from Scandinavia, Germany, Italy, China, and Ireland.  What made them come, where they settled, and we laid some stereotypes about what they came here to do.  \r\n\r\n<blockquote>Thousands of Irish immigrants worked on the railroads, while others became coal miners.  They built sewers, canals, houses, and mills, and also worked as servants, cooks, miners, and dockhands.<\/blockquote>\r\n\r\nWhat about being cops in Boston?  Didn't a lot of them do that?  And pub owners?  I think there were a lot of those too.  And did this passage mention that some of them were miners?  I didn't quite catch that.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Chinese immigrants held many different jobs in America, working as merchants, gardeners, domestic help, laundry workers, and farmers.<\/blockquote>\r\n\r\nDeleted during the editing phase was the statement that, \"Chinese people never learned how to drive automobiles very well, and whatever it is that they pass off as chicken in their restaurants sure is delicious!\"\r\n\r\nThere was some suggestion in the teaching manual that we get the kids to think about their own family history as it relates to immigration in the 1800s.  I chose not to follow that advice.  Not because the students weren't bright and enthusiastic -- they were actually an awesome group -- but because there wasn't a single white or Asian student in the entire class.  I can just imagine the awkward pause when I asked, \"Did any of your ancestors come to America to escape the potato famine in Ireland?\"\r\n\r\nI hope that next week's lesson is more interesting."

So I guess he has to fly to corporate for meetings every now and then.\r\n<!--more-->\r\nOne thing that most Baton Rouge residents know is the availability of flights from our airport.  You can take Northwest to Memphis, Continental to Houston, American to Dallas, or Delta to Atlanta.  That's it.  No other choices.\r\n\r\nIt just so happens that three of the four --Continental, Delta, and Northwest -- share frequent flyer miles and elite customer programs between each other.  So most of the business travelers in town pretty much stick to these three.  (It doesn't help American that their service really, really sucks in and out of Baton Rouge, and that they want you to pay $2 for your bag of pretzels.)\r\n\r\nOne recent morning, the Big Doofus had a flight scheduled through Houston to California.  There happened to be a huge storm that day, which passed through Houston canceling the morning flights.  By the time of the afternoon flights, the storm had made its way west, and was right over Baton Rouge.\r\n\r\nThe Big Doofus was pretty mad about having to spend the whole day in the airport.  He called the office to chew out his secretary for booking that flight, as if she could have known about the weather.  He demanded that all of his future flights be on Delta through Atlanta.\r\n\r\nThat's right.  He wanted to fly to Atlanta so that he could turn around and fly to California from the East Coast.\r\n\r\nThe dutiful secretary canceled his Houston flight and booked him a flight through Atlanta the next morning.  But of course, the storm system continued its eastward track through the night, and had flights being canceled in Atlanta by the next morning.  Once again, he sat in the airport to find out about his flights being canceled.\r\n\r\nI don't know this for sure, but I suspect that he called his secretary at this point and accused her of witchcraft.  My friend who works there was asked to look into getting one of those machines that they used in Salem to drown suspected witches.\r\n\r\nAfter his second day of waiting, he canceled his trip.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, his co-workers had caught an American flight through Dallas and made all of their meetings at headquarters."

I don't remember seeing the episode where they premiered Scrappy Doo, but I would like to take a look back and see if there's any mention of where the little guy came from.\r\n\r\nI have my own hypothesis.\r\n<!--more-->\r\nFirst, let's agree that this wasn't a nephew through marriage.  If Scooby had an ex-wife running around out there, or if he was somehow widowed, surely he would have mentioned it from time to time.  Besides, the resemblance suggests a blood relation.\r\n\r\nI'm going with the theory that Scooby has a sister who is a bitch at some sort of Doberman breeding ground.  Based on my own experience with puppies, it's probably a rural house in Ascension Parish, Louisiana.\r\n\r\n<table cellpadding=\"2\" align=\"right\"><tr><td width=\"5\" rowspan=\"2\"><spacer type=\"block\" width=\"5\" height=\"1\"><\/td><td width=\"125\" ><img src=\"\/img\/scrappy.jpg\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td class=\"caption\" width=\"125\">The Yoko Ono of Saturday morning cartoons.<\/td><\/tr><\/table>\r\n\r\nScooby's sister bitch is probably producing satisfactory litters of puppies, returning her owner a nice profit.  But then one day, out comes an obnoxious little shit, who not only speaks, but who speaks without Scooby's impediment.  Needless to say, no one wanted to buy this puppy.\r\n\r\nSooner or later, the humans who owned Scooby's sister bitch gave up trying to sell Scrappy, and took him to Animal Control to be euthanized.  But as luck would have it, the dog catcher -- who was also in charge of euthanizing the unwanted animals -- was involved in a scheme to inherit sole rights to an oil well by scaring off others who had a legitimate claim to that well.  In order to scare them off, he set up an elaborate ploy to make the  oil field look haunted.\r\n\r\nFurthering the coincidence, that's about the time that Shaggy, Scooby, and the gang rolled into town.  They had heard that a nearby farmer had some good weed for sale, and the Mystery Machine supply was running low.\r\n\r\nOf course, you see where this is going.  The meddling kids caught wind of the haunted oil claim and couldn't resist solving the mystery.  The dog catcher was exposed as the fraud that he is, and they were back on the search for good weed.  As they were leaving, they heard Scrappy -- still in the back of the dog catcher truck -- yelping, as he hadn't been fed in several days.  (He was also covered in his own poo.)\r\n\r\nBecause he was so filthy and hungry, Scrappy was uncharacteristically quiet, and the gang immediately noticed the family resemblance.  It didn't take them long to work out the fact that Scrappy was the unwanted bastard child of Scooby's sister bitch, so they took him in.\r\n\r\nBy the time Scrappy returned to his normal self, the kids felt a certain amount of responsibility to him, and they kept him around for a number of years.\r\n\r\nThose who helped the gang solve mysteries were not so enamored.  During one fateful chance encounter several years later, The Harlem Globetrotters and Don Knotts became so annoyed with the little fellow that they arranged for him to do an errand which took him right into a wilderness reserve that was known to be populated by a family of Bigfoots.  The little guy never returned.\r\n\r\n"

I can't imagine that there are any residents -- short of those involved in large DIY projects at the house -- who can actually come close to filling these things twice a week.

Then, I logged in to a different computer, and let it go through the motions of downloading the rest of that junk.  That way, I didn't tie up my main computer with the downloads, and all of the repeat junk wouldn't hose up any changes I had made to the file tags after their initial download.\r\n\r\n(I'm geeking out right now.)\r\n\r\nMy main complaint is regarding the format wars going on with downloaded music.  The Itunes store provides music in a format that allows you to play it only through itunes and on an IPOD.  More restrictive yet, you can only play it on a computer where Itunes is registered with YOU.  So I can't let you download one of my files and think that you would be able to play them.\r\n\r\nThe only way around this restriction is to burn my files to a CD, and let you have the CD.  It's an annoying work around.\r\n\r\nThe other services are similarly restrictive.  Files that you buy from most of them will work fine on windows media player and on most MP3 players that you can buy, but don't bother trying to play them on an IPOD.  Most of the other services post a work around, but it requires modifying settings in some way that is a little much to ask from the average doofus who just wants to listen to the Paul Anka CD that he just downloaded.\r\n\r\nThe whole format war is reminiscent of Beta vs. VHS back in the early days of VCR.  Beta was a technologically superior format, but Sony had the patent and wouldn't let the other VCR makers license the rights to make beta VCRs.  Look what happened there.  But this time, everyone wants to be Sony.\r\n\r\nThe VHS equivalent for today is the good old MP3 format.  Everyone can play them.  Yet these companies force us to buy their proprietary formats to pigeonhole us into brand loyalty.  The whole thing stinks.\r\n\r\nThere's a similar format debate for high-def DVDs.  HD-DVD and blu-ray compete to be the format of choice for high-def video for your television.  I'm not well-read enough to know which is the better technology (if one is indeed better).  But it's interesting to note that Sony is once again one of the players -- it has the patent for blu-ray.  Will it repeat its Beta mistake, or openly license its technology?  Time will tell.\r\n\r\nI guess the worst thing about this corporate pissing matches is that the consumer can't get to the new goods.  Who wants to shell out a lot of money for a HD-DVD player when it might be obsolete in a few years?  So everyone waits, and no one is seeing their DVDs in high def, save the real audio\/visual geeks who go ahead and drop huge money on one side or the other.\r\n\r\nGetting back to itunes, I really like the updated version, now that I'm over the bug hump.  It does a much better job segragating different types of content, so you don't inadvertantly get a television episode in the middle of your music playlist.  I notice too that my new IPOD has a search feature, which will probably be very useful.  \r\n\r\nThere's one feature that I'm waiting for with the IPOD.  When I select an artist, it gives me a list of their albums as a sub-selection.  I want that list to be ordered chronologically rather than alphabetically.  Any long-time album collector will have to agree with me in spades.\r\n\r\n"

No picture of my beagle humping one of the cats or anything else.  So I page through other email looking for anything other than people asking me to do more for them.\r\n\r\nHere's one from Shelly.  Subject line:  Hey Fucker.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>how come manufacturers can, through bioengineering, alter foods so that they will become pest resistant, flavor enhanced, and retain freshness longer but they can't make a double stuffed oreo that won't make your ass grow?

I find myself not paying attention a lot when the subject is uninteresting.  i just set my fantasy football line up.<\/blockquote>\r\n\r\nSpeaking of Oreos, we came up with a really good idea for the terrorists this morning.  Take the two black cookie parts of an Oreo.  Put a layer of plastic explosive between each half, fill up a ziplock bag, and carry that right on to the plane.\r\n\r\nSure, maybe this only blows off the terrorist's head when he bites into the cookie, but that would still scare the shit out of everyone else on board, wouldn't it.  How would you like to be the blood-splattered person sitting next to the headless corpse in seat 13C?\r\n\r\nThat wasn't really the cathartic pick-me-up I needed.\r\n\r\nHere's one from Slim, posted on my <a href=\"http:\/\/www.rhodes22.org\/mailman\/listinfo\/rhodes22-list\" target=\"_blank\">sailing email list<\/a> yesterday.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>That reminds me of an incident that happened to my friend and boat partner, Judi, who was cruising in the middle of the Atlantic when they ran out of cigs and booze. They hailed a British merchant vessel and asked if they could sell them some. The Brits said if it were a real emergency they'd be happy to help, but cigs and booze? Forget it--we're not changing coarse and spending extra fuel on that! Next they hailed a German vessel--same response. After some despair, they finally raised a Brazilian ship: \"Oh my god!

You get the number of points that the betters were giving on that game.  So if you pick a long shot who wins you get a lot of points, and if you pick a slight underdog, you get a few points.  I'm not on the board yet, but only because Michigan State blew a sizable lead to Notre Dame last weekend.  Here's how I emailed my pick for this Saturday.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>WHAT COMES OUT OF A CHINAMANâ€™S ASS?\r\n\r\nI'll take Rice.\r\n<\/blockquote>\r\n\r\nNow that I've offended a major university as well as the world's largest ethnic group, I feel a lot better.

		"post_content" : "This past Monday, I had what might have been my personal best football game experience.  If you happened to catch any of the sports networks, CNN, or even Al Jazeera, you will know that the Monday Night Football game this week marked the reopening of the Superdome for the first time since Hurricane Katrina.  A whole day of hullabaloo was scheduled, and I left work at lunch time to check it all out.\r\n<!--more-->\r\nThe weather was perfect.  Clear, dry, breezy, and warm but not hot.  The blocks around the Superdome weren't blocked off, but they were rendered useless for all of the foot traffic.  Someone had set up stages for live music and there were beer trucks nearby, so the traffic handlers couldn't have been surprised.  \r\n\r\nWe stopped by a friend's party nearby.  They've got a new place downtown in a great location.  It was fun to see them (and eat their food and drink their beer), but they had all of the hoopla on TV, and it made me itch to get out in the middle of it.  So I (most rudely) grabbed one more beer, said my thanks, and hit the road.\r\n\r\n<table cellpadding=\"2\" align=\"right\"><tr><td width=\"5\" rowspan=\"2\"><spacer type=\"block\" width=\"5\" height=\"1\"><\/td><td width=\"250\" ><img src=\"\/img\/neworleans1.jpg\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td class=\"caption\" width=\"250\">Poydras Street outside of the Superdome a few hours before the game.<\/td><\/tr><\/table>\r\n\r\nWe were soon among the masses clogging the streets, enjoying the music and watching the people.  Eddie claimed to have spotted Danny Bonaduce eating a giant turkey leg and a little later Joey Buttafuco, but I'm skeptical about both sightings.\r\n\r\nUp the ramp where the Superdome entrance doors are, there were activities galore, and a stage featuring the Gin Blossoms.  It wasn't possible to get too close to the stage, but that was okay as I listened and recalled that they only sing kind of sucky chick-friendly songs from the early 90s.\r\n\r\nMaybe I shouldn't write this, but we couldn't help but notice that New Orleans on Monday was a very vanilla city.  I'm used to the Saints home crowd to a very diverse one (well, not technically diverse, since there were a whole lot of black people and a whole lot of white people and not many others).  But Monday, the sea of white faces was a reminder that not all of the Saints fans are home.  So that was kind of a disappointment.\r\n\r\nIf it bothered anyone of any race, you sure couldn't tell.  When the doors opened, the crowd surged ever so slowly toward the door.  But spirits were high, and all of the complaining was in a joking fashion.  \"If I could get wood, I'd poke all these guys with it, and I bet I would move right to the front of the line,\" I heard someone say.\r\n\r\nThe teams were warming up when I sat down.  We watched them do their drills for a while.  When they returned to the locker room, the cheer was as loud as in a touchdown during a normal game.  This crowd was ready.\r\n\r\nThe pregame performance featuring U2 and Green Day was fantastic.  As you'll see from my pictures, my live eyes could see only the top\/backs of heads, but the speakers surrounded the stage, and the band sounded great (not withstanding Billie Joe Armstrong's lack of tune at the beginning of the second song).  The second number turned into a rockin' little song called \"The Saints are Coming,\" which is a 70s punk tune that I had never heard, and had not been recorded by either of these bands.  The lyrics and fast music got the crowd on their feet, and the roar got louder.  After that show, I predicted that if the Saints were as fired up as the crowd that they would win by 30.\r\n\r\n<table cellpadding=\"2\" align=\"right\"><tr><td width=\"5\" rowspan=\"2\"><spacer type=\"block\" width=\"5\" height=\"1\"><\/td><td width=\"250\" ><img src=\"\/img\/neworleans2.jpg\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td class=\"caption\" width=\"250\">Coach Sean Peyton communes with the fans after the game.<\/td><\/tr><\/table>\r\n\r\nThere was more pregame hoopla, but the only point worth mentioning is that the PA announcer made it good and clear that the tosser of the coin was President Bush #41, of Clinton\/Bush relief fund renown -- not President W, of \"You're doing a great job, Brownie\" fame.\r\n\r\nI've never been to a huge important playoff game, but I can't imagine that the atmosphere is any more intense than when this game started.  All of the announcers on the broadcasts mentioned it, and the players talked about the crowd noise without exception after the game.  I think it might have been the most consistently loud event in the history of the stadium.\r\n\r\nThe Saints played off it right from the start.  They went on defense first, and the roar of the crowd was so that you couldn't even make out the voice next to you.  The Falcons went three and out, and then had their punt blocked and recovered for a Saints touchdown.\r\n\r\nThe Saints won 23-3, and although the crows simmered down just a little bit for part of the second half, there was hardly an empty seat in the whole Dome.  The crowd stuck around until the last of the Saints were off the field.  \r\n\r\nIt took a pretty reasonable two hours to get home once we got clear of the crowd and out to the parking garage -- one hour to get out of the garage, and one hour to get home.  All drivers on the interstate agreed to cruise along at a steady speed around 90 mph.  I didn't really know that my Jeep would sustain that kind of speed, but I was glad that it did.\r\n\r\nWhen I got back into the house, it was 1:30.  I had an inclination to start watching the recording of the game, but some common sense told me to feed the cats and get to bed.\r\n\r\nThe whole collection of photos from Monday is posted <a onclick=\"window.open('\/pg3.php?spgmGal=44%20-%20Superdome%20Reopens','44SuperdomeReopens','width=625, height=768, toolbar=no, location = no, directories=no, menubar=no, resizable=yes, scrollbars=no');\" href=\"#\">here<\/a>."

With most people -- and sometimes, even with me -- this would signify a project gone hopelessly awry or an urgent need for a vacation.  But my reasons this morning were different.\r\n\r\nI started to laugh at the message.  I was able to hold in the noisy, audible part of the laugh, but I couldn't help the abdominal convulsions, and it jiggled the bed enough to disturb Mrs. theskinnyonbenny.\r\n<!--more-->\r\nCourteous guy that I am, I got up to catch a Timmy and Lassie rerun on cable.  In this one, Lassie adopted a bobcat cub and had to hide it in the barn, as she knew she was doing wrong.  \"Don't scold her mother,\" Timmy implored. \"She knows she did wrong, but she did it for love.\"  And oh yeah, the bobcat cub was clearly a Siamese cat.  I had missed the beginning of the episode, and spent almost the whole show thinking that the mama bobcat wanted to eat Lassie's Siamese friend.  How did people used to watch this garbage?\r\n\r\nAnyway, the message that got me up so early was this:\r\n\r\n<blockquote>From: Dewey ______ \r\nSent: Tuesday, September 19, 2006 1:52 PM\r\nTo: IS HelpDesk\r\nSubject: chair\r\n\r\nCould I swap my chair with one in a conference room?

That and the fact that the corporate help desk does not also serve as furniture police.\r\n\r\nI laughed hard at the thought of their potential reaction to this message.  It wasn't one I considered, but the actual reaction strikes me as no less funny:\r\n\r\nTommy:  \"It looks like Dewey left his desk with his computer unlocked.\"\r\n\r\nKeith:  \"What did Ben send us?\"\r\n\r\nNewsflash to myself:  you are a predictable hack.\r\n\r\nThis was one of dozens of messages sent from Dewey's account this week.

I say it was predictable -- and that guy was noticeably more clumsy than some of his opponents, but I can't honestly say that I can look at their performances and tell a good one from a bad one.  I watch with the same naive innocence that I did when I was real little, watching football without a good understanding of the rules.  Some can just follow the ball and enjoy a football game, where the more experienced viewer will might watch for particular offensive or defensive formations.  The really, really serious viewer will notice the positioning of specific blockers or defensive players away from the ball.\r\n<!--more-->\r\nNow how did I get to posting about football?\r\n\r\nAnyway, I'm like that uneducated viewer, just watching the ball.  I have no idea what distinguishes a foxtrot from a cha-cha.\r\n\r\nHaving only seen a couple of them perform, my pick for this year is the Vivica Fox -- the black chick who mixed it up with Uma Thurman in the first <i>Kill Bill<\/i>.  You can't picture that scene and not realize that she's got moves.\r\n\r\nThe highlight for me was to see Emmitt Smith's big gut.  He apparently hangs right with me when it comes to drinking beer and eating chicken wings.  While I enjoyed seeing the chubby tailback, I couldn't help think about others who I think would make better contestants.\r\n\r\nWithout further fanfare, here's my pick for next season's Dancing lineup.  Apologies to Ellen DeGeneres, but whining to get on the show is a sure way to get left off, as long as I'm a producer.  Besides, I'm a little comedian-heavy anyway.\r\n\r\n<b>Isaac from the Love Boat:<\/b>  Who wouldn't want to see what Isaac is looking like these days?  And I would strongly encourage him to end every dance with that hp-cat double-index finger point toward the camera, just like he did during the opening credits on the show.\r\n\r\n<b>Bill Gates:<\/b>  Don't laugh at me.  You know you would love to see it.\r\n\r\n<b>Monica Lewinsky:<\/b>  Just because she probably needs the work.  And oh yeah, for the blowjob jokes.\r\n\r\n<b>Chevy Chase:<\/b>  Just think of the goofy faces he would make at the camera after tripping on his partner.  I think it's a close race between Chevy and Bill for who's the worst dancer in this group.\r\n\r\n<b>Tom Hanks:<\/b>  It's supposed to be Dancing With the <i>Stars<\/i>.  To a large extent, it's Dancing With People I've Barely or Never Heard Of.  This is a star, a bona fide star.  He doesn't have to last, but you've got to get an A-lister.  Hell, <i>The Surreal Life<\/i> has a better Q rating this year than DWTS.\r\n\r\n<b>Rosanne:<\/b>  What this competition sorely needs is a fat person.  Could Roseanne's body do all of those things that the in shape dancers do?  Of course not.  But wouldn't it be fun to see her try!  And if she sets the crowd to booing, maybe she would spit and grab her crotch, as if the National Anthem were playing.\r\n\r\n<b>That Asian kid who can eat a million hot dogs every few minutes:<\/b>  I don't know his name either, but I'm curious about whether he has any other abilities.  He's a wild card:  maybe out in round one, maybe he's pretty good.  He won't bonk from lack of calories, that's for sure.  \r\n\r\n<b>Cameron Diaz or Angelina Jolie:<\/b>  Just to give us one set of long, good looking legs.  This season lacks a Stacy Keibler, and that's a pity.\r\n\r\n<b>Axl Rose:<\/b>  We need someone with bad hair.  No pulling it back into a pony tail allowed.  He has to dance with his hair in the way.  And you will also recall that the only move he has is to sway his hips back and forth with feet firmly planted on the ground.  It should be good.\r\n\r\n<b>Senator Mary Landrieu:<\/b>  Known nationally for the post-Katrina smackdown that she took from Cooper Anderson, what better way for Senator Landrieu to be taken seriously as a politician than to show her constituents that she can ballroom dance?\r\n\r\n<b>Dale Earnhardt, Jr.:<\/b>  No having athletes from sports where footwork is important.  The dancing comes too naturally to a football player who's been zig-zagging through cones his whole life.  How about a redneck who has spent his whole life making left turns?  That might give us something to see.\r\n\r\nSo there you have it.  Admittedly, it's a little heavy on washed up TV stars, and there aren't enough black people.  But I didn't want any ringers.  It should all be people that might struggle with the dancing.\r\n\r\nHopefully there will be something better on next Wednesday night."

Although it was still dark, it was already kind of hot.  The air was heavy with humidity and there was nary a breeze.\r\n\r\nI sat down to cool off and switched from hot coffee to a cold bloody mary.  About that time, a large group of joggers passed through.  I shouted my encouragement.  \"Hey psychopaths!  Come get a donut and a beer!\"  \r\n\r\n<table cellpadding=\"2\" align=\"right\"><tr><td width=\"5\" rowspan=\"2\"><spacer type=\"block\" width=\"5\" height=\"1\"><\/td><td width=\"250\" ><img src=\"\/img\/blossomskirt.jpg\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td class=\"caption\" width=\"250\">Like many LSU cheerleaders, Blossom has trouble keeping her skirt on.<\/td><\/tr><\/table>\r\n\r\nOne lady yelled something back.  It seemed to be a good-natured reply, but I couldn't make out the words.  How is it that something that makes it difficult to yell could be good for you?\r\n\r\nLater, a second group of joggers got similar treatment.\r\n\r\nIt turns out that this is the week that the exercise gods get to deal the karma cards.\r\n\r\nYesterday at lunch time, the morning rain had cleared, and the sun was breaking through the clouds.  I went home, changed, and headed out for a bike ride.  I got a couple miles in and felt a few sprinkles.  They felt good, so I kept peddling.  It's not relevant to the story, but I want to mention that I was strong as a racehorse early yesterday.\r\n\r\nOf course you see this coming.  I got as far as I get from home, and the sky opened up.  All of a sudden, I'm the exercise psychopath peddling through the downpour.  The water washed over me as if I were riding through a car wash.  As it first ran down my face, it was salty with the sweat from my hair, but in no time, it came down fresh and clean.\r\n\r\nMy shoes and socks became soaked and squished through every pedal stroke.  My shorts sucked up against my skin, but shrinkage prevented me from being an obscenity to the passing motorists.\r\n\r\nI got home, cleaned up, and changed in time to see the weather clear up a bit.\r\n\r\nGetting back to the tailgate party, it was a good time.  Having started on the bloody marys by 6:30, you might correctly guess that I had plenty too much to drink.  The day flew by -- it seems like we were out there a few hours rather than 12 hours.  \r\n\r\n<table cellpadding=\"2\" align=\"left\"><tr><td width=\"250\" ><img src=\"\/img\/benkiss.jpg\"><\/td><td width=\"5\" rowspan=\"2\"><spacer type=\"block\" width=\"5\" height=\"1\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td class=\"caption\" width=\"250\">Ben makes out with Beethoven.  Or Mozart.  Whoever.<\/td><\/tr><\/table>\r\n\r\nI suppose this picture merits some explanation.  From where we set up the tailgate, the nearest restroom is in the music building.  As you come in the door, you're greeted by this statue. I can't remember if this is Beethoven or Mozart;  all of those old composers sport the same hairstyle.  After a full day of going in and out, I for some reason decided to ask a girl to take a picture of me making out with him.  She complied, with the stipulation that she be able to take the picture with her camera also.  All was good.\r\n\r\nAs she took the snapshot, she said, \"This is making me so hot.\"\r\n\r\nSo I replied something like, \"Well, it's good that you have that picture.  You can pull it out and look at it while you masturbate.\"\r\n\r\nShe didn't even reply.  She just grabbed her friend's arm and ran.\r\n\r\nThere aren't a whole lot of photos from that day, but I've posted the good ones that I have <a onclick=\"window.open('\\pg3.php?spgmGal=45%20-%20LSU%20vs%20Arizona%20Tailgate','45LSUvsArizonaTailgate','width=625, height=768, toolbar=no, location = no, directories=no, menubar=no, resizable=yes, scrollbars=no');\" href=\"#\" >here<\/a>.\r\n"

There's just so much that's wrong with that message that I don't know where to begin, starting with the fact that next week <i>is<\/i> the Arizona game.  And how about a subject line that has something to do with the subject of the message?  I already knew it was intended for me.\r\n\r\nSo anyway, I'm frying the armadillo on Saturday the ninth.  If you've forgotten the location, here's a map.\r\n\r\n<table cellpadding=\"2\" align=\"right\"><tr><td width=\"5\" rowspan=\"2\"><spacer type=\"block\" width=\"5\" height=\"1\"><\/td><td width=\"250\" ><img src=\"\/img\/TailgateMap.jpg\"><\/td><\/tr><\/table>\r\n\r\nI'm really looking forward to it all this year.  Last year, the tailgate regulars were scarce, as the hurricane had them scattered all over the place.  Eddie didn't make it out other than one short appearance, as he failed to count months correctly and ended up with a newborn right in time for football season.  So we're long overdue for a good throwdown.\r\n\r\nToday is that first day of the year where the summer humidity is gone.  This is unusually early, but so so nice.  There's also a breeze.  I can't remember an August 31 where it seems like it would be nice to sit outside, but today is the first.  We probably won't have weather like this again for three more weeks, at least.\r\n\r\nGetting back to football, I like the way LSU's season shapes up.  The toughest game early in the season is a visit to Auburn, but Auburn is installing a new defense, and we'll be the first major college challenge.  If this game were late in the season, I would worry, but I think they will blow a coverage or two, and the talented Tigers (as opposed to the War Eagle Plainsman Tigers) will make them pay.\r\n\r\nI am so extremely happy to be <a href=\"\/ve\/page.php?fn=ve_s4.content\">sailing again<\/a> for the fall.  It usually works out that I catch at least half of the Saints games on the radio from the sailboat, and with almost every game at noon on Sunday, this season promises to be no different.  I'm a fan, so I'm able to convince myself that the Saints have a shot at the playoffs every year.  But every year they become a minor embarrassment.  (At least we don't have a quarterback who laughs at his interceptions any more.  That should make it a little better.)\r\n\r\nSpeaking of sailing -- and I'm off on a tangent now -- I just took a call from Mrs. theskinnyonbenny to let me know that she had obtained new boat insurance.  After a couple of queries about how much they're sticking us for and what a hassle it was to get insurance for a boat that was previously totaled by a hurricane, I concluded my questioning.  She wrapped up with a deadpan, \"So I guess you can go ramming other boats willy-nilly now.\"\r\n\r\nLiability insurance is nice.\r\n\r\nOn to my predictions:\r\n\r\nLSU:  10-2 regular season.  The tigers lose at least one of the games that they should win (Arizona, Ole Miss, Kentucky, or Fresno State), and one where the game could go either way (Auburn, Florida, Tennessee, or Alabama.  I'll go ahead and hesitantly throw Arkansas into this category too).  They sneak into the SEC championship against Georgia or Florida, win that, and take care of business in the first post-Katrina Sugar Bowl.\r\n\r\nSaints:  8-8.  The Saints back door into the playoffs when three other teams choke and collapse during the last two weeks of the regular season.\r\n\r\nMy response to Eddie's message was this:\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\nFrom: Ben  \r\nSent: Thursday, August 31, 2006 2:39 PM\r\nTo: Eddie \r\nSubject: RE: Ben,\r\n\r\nAre you drunk now?  Next week is the Arizona game.  I'll fry the armadillo though.  Doesn't matter to me.\r\n<\/blockquote>\r\n\r\nTo which he responded,\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\nFrom: Eddie \r\nSent: Thursday, August 31, 2006 2:41 PM\r\nTo: Ben \r\nSubject: RE: Ben,\r\n\r\nno, but i'm naked ....\r\nSincerely,\r\nFloyd Cramer\r\n<\/blockquote>\r\n\r\nI guess that's probably not funny to anyone but us.  We've just always thought that it was funny to work a naked (or sometimes a masturbating) <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Floyd_Cramer\" target=\"_blank\">Floyd Cramer<\/a> into conversation.\r\n\r\n"

This summer has featured really bad television along with Mrs. theskinnyonbenny being out of town or at work dinners more often than I'm used to.  The result is that I've been reading books like Burgess Meredith in <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Time_Enough_at_Last\" target=\"_blank\">that old <i>Twilight Zone<\/i><\/a> episode.\r\n\r\nAlthough I've been pretty happy with most of my choices, I'm compelled to pass along some praise for <a href=\"http:\/\/search.barnesandnoble.com\/booksearch\/isbnInquiry.asp?z=y&EAN=9780743250627&itm=1\" target=\"_blank\">this book<\/a>.  I've been reading a little bit every day, and rarely does a day pass where I fail to laugh out loud, even when reading all by myself.\r\n<!--more-->\r\n<table cellpadding=\"2\" align=\"right\"><tr><td width=\"5\" rowspan=\"2\"><spacer type=\"block\" width=\"5\" height=\"1\"><\/td><td width=\"250\" ><img src=\"\/img\/smartest_big.jpg\"><\/td><\/tr><\/table>\r\n\r\nThe jist of it is this:  the author gives us a running narrative as he reads the <i>Encyclopaedia Britannica<\/i> all the way through from A to Z.  As he reads, he comments on entries.  Sometimes, he highlights an odd fact that was learned in the Encyclopedia, but other times, he relates real-life stories that touch only tangentially on the coincident Encyclopedia text.  Either way, it's a riot.\r\n\r\nLast night, I was reading in the P's.  In the midst of his comments for <b>Plato<\/b>, he dismisses some notion of Plato's that there is a separate universe where everything exists in its \"ideal\" state.  After a couple of examples of why this is \"hogwash\" (good word there), he uses the ideal of personal beauty as an example.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>And what of beauty?  Anyone who says that it's eternal needs to take a look at the stone cutting they show in the <i>Britannica<\/i> representing Helen of Troy, the great beauty of her day.  She looked like a drag queen in need of a nose job.  Today, that Helen of Troy wouldn't make it past a local Miss ZBroccoli pageant, much less Miss Universe.  She wouldn't launch a dinghy today.<\/blockquote>\r\n\r\nI'm a little bit disappointed in one thing.  I hit an entry one day recently where he used the phrase \"va-va-voom.\"  You know -- the goofy phrase that old men used to say when they would see a good looking woman.  I had just mentioned that I was going to start trying to bring back \"va-va-voom\" and lo and behold, here it is in a popular book.  Now I will get none of the credit when this term comes back as a full blown popular expression.\r\n\r\nI also just realized that A. J. Jacobs is the same writer who did <a href=\"http:\/\/search.barnesandnoble.com\/booksearch\/isbnInquiry.asp?z=y&EAN=9780553373752&itm=3\" target=\"_blank\"><i>The Two Kings<\/i><\/a>.  This was a fifteen minute illustrated booklet which hillariously and blasphemously compared Jesus and Elvis.  For example, I remember a page that was something like, \r\n\r\n\"Jesus healed the sick...\"\r\n\r\n\"...Elvis provided prescription drugs to his friends and family.\"\r\n\r\nThat book was also good stuff.\r\n\r\nThere are a couple of things that endear me to the quest of reading the entire Encyclopedia Britannica.  First, my father is also an encyclopedia reader.  As a kid, he read the World Book -- admittedly much more of a low-brow Encyclopedia -- from A to Z.\r\n\r\nWhen I was a kid, we had that same stack of work out and outdated World Books.  Want to know about space exploration?  Too bad.  Hadn't happened yet when these books were published.  Vietnam War?  Don't make me laugh.  Korea might have even been a single country in this edition of World Book.\r\n\r\nThe second thing that endears me to this is my own quest -- first mentioned well over a year ago -- to listen to every song on my IPOD alphabetically by title.  \r\n\r\nI like listening to the music that I'm in the mood to hear.  I say this in order to make an excuse for this:  I'm only into the D's.  It appears that I have two or three more years to go on this project.\r\n\r\nI should explain this mission in more detail in a future post, but for now, I'll just pass along a lyric that I've been fond of for many years.  Beck's \"Debra\" came up on the IPOD as I sat outside and read last night.  I've always liked this song a lot, and it's been a long time since my own twirling through the playlists brought it up.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>I wanna get with you\r\nAaaaaaaaaaaaaa girl\r\n...and your sister\r\nI think her name's Debra<\/blockquote>\r\n\r\nI've never \"gotten with\" a girl and her sister, but I suspect that it would be avisable to firm up one's knowledge of <i>both<\/i> girls' name before asking for the tryst."

		"post_content" : "The other day, I was bicycling around the lakes near LSU.  I was coming up behind a walker who was cruising down the center of the bike path.  This isn't uncommon, and it's not a big deal.  But I don't want to just fly up past with an inch or two to spare.  I would either scare the shit out of her, or if she veers the wrong way, cause an accident with no serious injury, but one that features a lot of spilled blood.\r\n\r\nThe normal etiquette for this is a clear warning call.  \"ON YOUR LEFT!\"\r\n\r\nI'm used to the person sliding casually to the right as if he intended to move out of the center all along.  Rarely does anyone glance back and acknowledge me.\r\n<!--more-->\r\nBut the woman this week leapt immediately, doing a quarter-turn as she hopped all the way off the path.  She looked back at me with wide, terrified eyes.  I expect that it's an expression common on an Israeli who had heard \"INCOMING KATYUSHA!\"\r\n\r\nI wanted to show her that there was nothing to fear without breaking my stride, so I gave her an extra-friendly, \"Thanks!\" as I passed.  At the same time, she said, \"Sorrrry.\"\r\n\r\nI don't know if she heard my \"No Prob!\" before I was out of there.  Next time, she'll know not to be so scared.\r\n\r\nThe demographic that usually scares easily is the small dog.  Please owners, keep the leash pretty tight when on the path during crowded times of the day and near the road.  The dogs get spooked, try to dart, and the tightening leash spins them either right in front of the bike, or the other direction which is often right into the traffic.  I've seen a couple of close calls that would give me nightmares if I wasn't such a sound sleeper. \r\n\r\nThis bike path episode isn't the only exercise-related encounter with an odd woman that I've had this week.  \r\n  \r\nI went to the YMCA to play basketball at lunch on Tuesday.  The Y has a really big gym, but there are always a lot of things going on.  I commonly see a class where elderly people work out with small weights while seated in chairs that appear to have been lifted from an elementary school.  There's a class where a hard core trainer makes the people do all kind of painful looking exercises in a short period of time.  And there are the mentally challenged people who walk slowly around and around the perimeter of the gym.\r\n\r\nTuesday this week featured the mentally challenged gymnasium circumnavigators.\r\n\r\nAt one point, I was chasing down a loose basketball.  The ball bounced in the way of one of the walkers, who had to stutter-step to keep from tripping on it.  I gave her my charming, apologetic half-smile, which she might have misinterpreted as a flirtation.\r\n\r\n\"What's your name?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"Ben.\"\r\n\r\n\"<i>Ben!?<\/i>\"  She asked this in a disgusted look and tone.  The response would have been appropriate if I had ignored her question and replied, \"I like to eat turds,\" but it was a wholly inappropriate response to a common first name.\r\n\r\n\"What's wrong with that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I know another guy named Ben, and he is EVIL.\" \r\n\r\n\"Hmmm.  Well, maybe I'm extra nice.  To balance it all out, you know.\"\r\n\r\nShe seemed to accept this explanation and continued walking.\r\n\r\nAs they made their turn around the end of the court and started back past on the other side, I heard her say to her companion, \"...but he says that he just balances it out....\""

I think it just stands as funny on its own.  I will, however, let you know when this guy kicks my ass for making fun of him on the internet.\r\n<!--more-->\r\n<center><img src=\"\/img\/greenline.gif\"><\/center>\r\n\r\nLast Friday night, at around 11:00, we were sitting outside in the back yard having drinks and shooting the shit.  We had cooked some fish a number of hours earlier (which were delicious, by the way) and were several drinks into the night. \r\n\r\nMrs. theskinnyonbenny asked that I fix her a gin and tonic.  That's a new drink for her, but I agreed to go ahead and fix it.  I knew the gin bottle was green, so I poured it over ice, and added liquid from the can next to the bottle.\r\n\r\n\"What are you making?\" Sharples asked me.  He had kind of an incredulous tone in his voice.\r\n\r\nI looked down at the hand with the can, and I was actually pouring Black Cherry Fresca.  I don't know where the heck Black Cherry Fresca came from, but that's what I was pouring, sure enough.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, so I guess she gets Gin and Black Cherry Fresca.  That shouldn't be too bad.\"\r\n\r\n\"No dude.  What did you pour from that bottle?\"\r\n\r\nI gave the green bottle a close inspection, and found that it was the smaller green bottle.  That is, it was olive oil, left out from when we had cooked fish rather than the larger green bottle, which was the gin.\r\n\r\n\"Mmmmm.  Olive oil and Black Cherry Fresca.  That can't be good.\"  I gave it a little taste.  Other than being greasy, it wasn't too awful.  \"Let's serve it to her!\"\r\n\r\nI started to walk toward Mrs. theskinnyonbenny, but I found myself unable to wipe the shit-eating grin off my face.  Sharples had to take it over there and serve it while I pretended to look for a dropped bottle cap on the ground.\r\n\r\nYes, we actually served up an Olive oil and Black Cherry Fresca and let her drink it.  I am such a dick.\r\n\r\n<center><img src=\"\/img\/greenline.gif\"><\/center>\r\n\r\nI've entered the ranks of casino-going high rollers.  I received a card in the mail that entitles me to two free room at the casino's hotel.\r\n\r\nBut there are different levels of high-rollers, and I'm clearly on the very very bottom rung.  Here's how I know.\r\n\r\nFirst the coupon is for the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.harrahs.com\/casinos\/horseshoe-bossier-city\/hotel-casino\/property-home.shtml\" target=\"_blank\">Horseshoe Casino in Bossier City, LA<\/a>.  Not exactly the Bellagio.\r\n\r\nThen, I'm only allowed to the first of my free nights between September 4 and September 18.  And I'm only allowed to use the second of my free nights between September 19 and October 10.  Here's the kicker:  my free nights have to be <i>on a school night<\/i>.  That's right.  If I want to go to the Horseshoe Casino in Bossier City, LA, and if it happens to be a Friday or Saturday night, I'm going to be paying full price, just like everyone else.\r\n\r\n(I was just informed that this is actually a very nice hotel, so I'm glad that I was at least invited somewhere nice.  But still, it's Bossier City on a weekday.)\r\n\r\nSo there's no way I'll ever use this, but it's nice to in the high-roller club.  \r\n\r\nEven if it is just the shitty high roller club.\r\n"

Since this is a blog rather than journalism, I'm not going to do the research, but I'm going to guess that for every Rhode Islander killed by the Japanese in WWII, there were at least a few hundred Californians.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the early colony of Rhode Island had their own war against Japan.  But considering that there is no way to get from Rhode Island to Japan without traversing at least one continent and one ocean, it's hard to imagine how that could be possible.  Or how they could have irritated each other that much.\r\n\r\nOne more odd thing that I notice.  Japan does not have the word \"Island\" in its name, but it is actually an island nation.  Rhode \"Island\" is just as connected to North America as Nebraska is.\r\n\r\nHappy Victory Over Japan Day."

But after you've eaten several hands full, you start to feel sick to your stomach.\r\n\r\nThis is the week that I've officially turned on <a href=\"http:\/\/abc.go.com\/primetime\/wifeswap\/\" target=\"_blank\"><i>Wife Swap<\/i><\/a>.  For a few weeks in a row, I've found that I uncharacteristically didn't want to watch.  The episodes that were starting looked to be just like other episodes (or maybe the same ones) that I had already seen.  But I've come to realize that pretty much <i>all<\/i> of the episodes are exactly the same, and that I've had enough.  Just like potato chips.\r\n<!--more-->\r\nIf you've somehow missed this show, the basic idea is that they take two women who are as opposite as they could possibly be, and make them switch homes for a couple of weeks.  Hilarity ensues.  A couple of extreme examples include the switching of a bible thumper with a Wiccan and of a black lady with a racist.\r\n\r\nAlthough it would land me a quick trip to divorce court, I like to imagine what kind of swap wife I would get if I signed us up.\r\n\r\nShe would be a \"stay at home and watch soap opera\" type.  She would probably lecture me on the importance of having an adult in the home all day (we don't have kids, by the way), and of how I'm wasting my life by going to work.\r\n\r\nShe wouldn't deal with the money.  She might even come to me and ask if she could spend money on groceries or shoes or something like that.  This would be a disaster, as I would grant unfettered access to the check book, and we would be broke in no time.\r\n\r\nShe would hate animals, and insist that my dogs and cats be relegated to yard-only pets.\r\n\r\nShe would be willing to let the cleanliness of the house go to pot.  I probably woudn't notice, because with the animals outside, it would be cleaner than I'm used to anyway.\r\n\r\nShe would make me attend church, perhaps even on a weeknight.  But then she would come home and live in a most-unholy way.  For example, she would expect to be on the receiving end of charity.  Or she might steal from our friends when they weren't looking.  But by God, we wouldn't miss services on Wednesday night!\r\n\r\n(Speaking of stealing from one's friends, someone -- probably Carmel -- lost a necklace at our house on Saturday.  I got $40 from a pawn shop on Government Street.  Hope I didn't get ripped off.  If it was yours, let me know, and I'll tell you which pawn shop to visit so that you can buy it back.)\r\n\r\nMy swap wife definitely wouldn't appreciate football.  She would probably be one of those who bitches when I want to watch an LSU game.  By contrast, this past Sunday night, I went in to the bedroom after watching an HBO show.  Mrs. theskinnyonbenny wasn't really paying attention to the bedroom TV, but to her credit, it was tuned to the NFL preseason game.  It wasn't even a team with local interest, and the starters had long been benched.  That's a wife for you!  \r\n\r\nMy swap wife wouldn't drink, and would object to my drinking.  This is probably what would cause us to hurl f-bombs at each other, which leads to the show's producers high-fiving and taking each other out for drinks to celebrate another succesful show.\r\n\r\nMy swap wife wouldn't whine when I want to watch junk on TV.  Like <i>Wife Swap<\/i>."

It's just me spending my July evenings alone with Paul Sherwin and Phil Liggit on OLN.\r\n\r\nBecause people know I'm a fan, I get asked about the whole Floyd Landis thing a lot.  But before getting to the details, I should disclose that I've never been much of a Floyd Landis fan.  It always looks like he's sneering on the bike, and you never see a sign of really good sportsmanship from him like you do from a lot of the other riders.  Plus, should the name of the winner of the Tour de France evoke memories of the barber in Mayberry?\r\n<!--more-->\r\n<table cellpadding=\"2\" align=\"right\"><tr><td width=\"5\" rowspan=\"2\"><spacer type=\"block\" width=\"5\" height=\"1\"><\/td><td width=\"250\" ><img src=\"\/img\/landis.jpg\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td class=\"caption\" width=\"250\">Floyd Landis<\/td><\/tr><\/table>\r\nEven before the second test was in, I didn't think Landis's excuses rang true.  For one thing, the story didn't stay consistent.  At one point, the excuse was \"a false positive, caused by a shot of whisky after the previous day's race.\"\r\n\r\nI don't know much about doping in sport, but I'm pretty sure a shot of whisky doens't ever, ever manifest itself as synthetic testosterone in the urine.\r\n\r\nHow about, \"I just have naturally high testosterone?\"\r\n\r\nElevin times the level found in the average guy?  Try again.  I would be hard pressed to believe in a superman with four or five times the normal level.\r\n\r\nI heard yet another one today, but for the life of me, I can't remember what it was.  But it's sufficiently clear that this isn't the behavior of the non-doper.\r\n\r\nAn innocent guy would have had one story after the first positive result:\r\n\r\n\"I'm sure this is all just a big mistake. I had three negative tests before this stage and four negative results after.  There's no way this could possibly be anything other than a laboratory mistake.  And if the second test doesn't clear me, then there are big, big corruption problems in this sport.\"\r\n\r\nHe would have repeated that like George Bush said \"he waffles\" in 2004.\r\n\r\nIn athletics, it takes two positive tests of a sample to indict an athlete.  When the second test came back positive, the story should have changed, but only ever so slightly.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know who is responsilbe for this or why, but this is a scam of some sort.  I had negative tests just the day before and the day after.  Testosterone takes days or weeks to get out of the system.  I demand to know who is behind this, and what their motives could be.\"\r\n\r\nThis sort of thing would have us all talking about who is behind the scam.  The French organizers, looking to avoid another yellow jersey coming back to America?  The Discovery Team itself, in retaliation for leaving the team a few years ago?\r\n\r\nI really do have a question about that point that I make.  How is it that his testosterone could be through the roof on one stage, but be back to normal the very next day?\r\n\r\nThe good news is that I really like Oscar Pereiro, the defacto winner of the race.  The main reason I like him so much is that he's the star of this segment, which I saved from the 2005 Tour de France.  Oscar wasn't expected to compete this year.  Had he won a fair race over non-juiced opponents, it would be a great story.  It's a shame he was deprived of that.

I am 100% convinced that rumors of his drug use are nothing but false.  Every time he addresses such rumors -- which is really, really frequently -- he comes across convincingly and credible.  While drug tests got better and better in the first half of this decade, his competitors fell by the wayside.  Only Armstrong and Jan Ulrich got stronger year after year after year.  Let's also not forget that Armstrong was subject to one of sport's most demanding testing programs.  These guys are subject to random testing 365 days a year, no matter what country they are in, whether there is a race coming up, or whether they are expected to participate or not.  They are geared toward more frequent tests for the sport's elite.  And for all of that, Armstrong never failed a drug test."

Well that's how Mrs. theskinnyonbenny looked yesterday morning.\r\n\r\nIt started at 3:30 in the morning.  For some reason, I was awake, watching a show about crocodiles on the National Geographic channel.  To my great surprise, Mrs. theskinnyonbenny bolted out of the bedroom angry enough to be fitted for a straight jacket. \r\n<!--more-->\r\nI should back up.\r\n\r\nA couple of weeks ago, I was out of town.  While I was gone, a little cat -- who happens to look almost exactly like one of our current cats -- showed up, let himself in through the dog door, and helped himself to a cat food dinner.  He continued to stick around for attention and free cat food for the next couple of weeks, caring not about being chewed on by dogs or making friends with the native house cats.  \r\n\r\nWe called him Fletch -- after the Chevy Chase character who dresses up like something he's not and goes where he doesn't belong.  (Which is Chevy Chase's best character?  Irwin Fletcher vs. Clark Griswald.  Debate amongst yourselves.)\r\n\r\nFletch had let himself in trough the dog door, jumped up into bed, and taken a whiz right there by my sweet, slumbering wife.\r\n\r\nI sent her to bed in the spare bedroom and scrubbed cat pee out of the mattress.  Around 4:00, I fell asleep on the couch.\r\n\r\nLater in the morning, we were getting ready for work, and Mrs. theskinnyonbenny was still steamed.  She pulled out some underpants, only to find they had been chewed to ruin by one of the dogs.  She stomped around more angrily still.\r\n\r\nThen, when she was almost dressed and ready to leave, she stuck a foot into a sock.  I guess the sock was pretty threadbare, because her foot went right through the end, turning it into a flimsy sort of leg warmer.\r\n\r\nShe wadded up the sock in a rage, and threw it as far as possible (about 1 foot -- it was a torn sock).  My brain was telling me to stay cool, but my gut couldn't stifle the laugh.  I've never seen a foot go through a sock and for that to happen on the tail of these other disasters was just too funny.  It was like watching a cartoon, but with real people in your own house.\r\n\r\nI'm sure my laughing didn't help matters any, but I don't remember.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I had a pretty good day.  I was scheduled to have to go to a training class in Atlanta next week, but it got canceled yesterday.  I was in a group of people who chose to not go to this session earlier this year.  Procrastination pays.\r\n\r\nI got this message from one of the guys who went to the earlier session.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>From: Jerrod\r\nSent: Tuesday, August 01, 2006 2:25 PM\r\nTo: Ben \r\nSubject: \r\n\r\nI guess it really does pay to be a lazy mother fucker...\r\n\r\nJerrod<\/blockquote>\r\n\r\nI'm going to add that quote to the bottom of my personal stationary.\r\n\r\n"

The photo came to me with the following stream of consciousness:\r\n\r\n<blockquote>These are the \"newbie\" pictures of Caleb. We have a bunch more, but they are in a slide show that I don't know how to turn into individual pictures. He's even cuter now! Ben- why isn't there a picture of this gorgeous baby on your web page??

They asked that exclamation points be used sparingly until the current drought is alleviated.\r\n\r\nSo we're all very proud to have another kid in the family. Yet...\r\n\r\nI have to be honest.  All newborn babies look alike to me.  Almost exactly alike.  Race of the child doesn't seem to even make a difference.  I've seen black babies who look just like this.\r\n\r\nI think this is true for everyone, but it's just taboo to say so.  And I'm guessing that lots of people withhold their opinion that the red, wrinkly things aren't all that cute.  As with brides, you have to pretend that all babies are beautiful.\r\n\r\nSince we all looked pretty much like this, it causes me no surprise to learn, \"I think he looks just like you!\"  I think all uncles -- but particularly those of use who live in different cities -- get told this sort of thing in an attempt to endear the new kid to the new family.  \r\n\r\nHeck, my previous nephew got saddled with Benjamin as a middle name.  Perhaps that was to bribe me into liking him when he was a wrinkly red prune, or perhaps I deserve a namesake because I'm a really cool guy.  The fact that I like him now is because he's a great kid rather than the fact that he was named for a really neato grown up.\r\n\r\nLet's call a spade a spade, and just for today, agree to admit the following rules of thumb.\r\n\r\n<b>Newborn babies:<\/b>  Usually kind of ugly.\r\n\r\n<b>One year olds:<\/b>  Have their own look and personality, and they are usually pretty cute by then.\r\n\r\n<b>Toddlers and Little Kids:<\/b>  Almost always adorable.\r\n\r\n<b>Older kids:<\/b>  Develop their own way.  We all know someone who was an awkward kid that one year returned from Summer break as a beauty.  Heck, we saw Marsha Brady facilitate such a change for a classmate in the course of one episode.  Conversely, we've also known people who peaked in cuteness when they were six.  It's part of what makes people interesting.  No matter how you slice it, they ultimately turn into snotty teenagers.  Sorry parents, there's nothing you can do about that.\r\n\r\n<b>Brides:<\/b>  They aren't all beautiful.  Just check the wedding page in Sunday's paper.  But when we're together in person, it's okay to pretend that they all are."

The jist of it is a guy who goes and does really nasty jobs that real people have.\r\n\r\nThere was a close-to-home episode that premiered last week.  The episode is titled \"Skull Cleaner,\" but before we got to the stripping of skin, tendons, and brains from animal skulls, the host (Mike) went to a couple of those coon-ass meat shops to learn how to cook Louisiana-style.  Mike explained that they were going to make boudin and cracklins.  \"Boudin is a kind of... sausage?  Cracklin is...I don't know....\"\r\n<!--more-->\r\nSome old guy called Rocky explained that cracklins were fried ham skin\/fat, and that boudin was boiled liver stuffed into an intestine.  That made the boudin sound a lot grosser than it rally is.  \r\n\r\nNaturally, they highlight the nasty part of a job, but even so, it wasn't really as gross as I had expected.  First, he made boudin.  (For out-of-staters, I would describe it as dirty-rice dressing stuffed into a sausage casing.  Yes ladies, when you eat a good piece of sausage, you are eating intestine.  Don't sweat it.)\r\n\r\nMike starts out by handling cured, clean intestine with a woman named Phyllis.  Intestines start out looking like rather large, wide shoestrings.  Phyllis knows that it's a large intestine rather than a small.  Well into it, they mention that white rice and green onions are \"essential ingredients in boudin,\" giving the viewer his first insight into the fact that it's not a mess of liver stuffed into intestines.\r\n\r\nThey actually grind liver and pork together.  The product of this grinding comes out of a machine looking nasty as hell.  They add boiling broth and mix it into a slurry.  From there, it gets sloshed into a \"water cylinder,\" which is basically like a big funnel.  The pressure there shoots meat into the casing.  \r\n\r\nRocky flies through the making of these things.  He estimates that he's made a million links.\r\n\r\nThe discovery channel guy gives it a whirl, and does pretty well.  And nothing was really gross or dirty at all.\r\n\r\nAfter a commercial break, they came back to do cracklins.  The jist of cracklins is this:  when a pig gets butchered, there's this whole layer of skin and fat that a sane butcher would throw out.  In Louisiana, we fry this trash, and treat it as if it were food.  \r\n\r\nMike comes back on another day. I think it's a different place, but I'm not sure.  Phyllis and Rocky aren't there for sure.  He stars with a question.  \"What are we going to do?  We're going to mess up a pig, aren't we?\"\r\n\r\nThe guys in the shop pull out a big frozen brick of pigs' skins, about the size of a desktop computer console.  (\"Is this a pig or a series of pigs?\")  While it's frozen, they use a band saw to cut into strips, and then cut the strips into chunks.\r\n\r\nThe recipe is pretty simple:  drop the chunks of frozen skin and fat into boiling grease, and bullshit while they fry.\r\n\r\n\"Don't want to miss any crumbs.  Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"Fat is money.\"\r\n\r\nThey fry for 90 minutes.  Then they get pulled out and dropped into  a new super-hot grease to \"make the eyes pop.\"\r\n\r\n\"Stir!\"\r\n\r\n\"Smells up the neighborhood.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's nice how the frozen pig starts to melt on me.  Goes through the shirt and into the skin.  Cools you off.\"\r\n\r\nThe final step is to spread them out on newspaper and blot up the pools of grease with a towel.  \r\n\r\nI recently heard of a place that is supposed to have very good cracklins.  I was over at a friend's house for dinner, and our host had gotten our food at the same shop.  I can't remember the name for the food we were eating, but it was basically pork sausage stuffed into a pig's stomach for cooking.\r\n\r\nHe prepared it in a red sauce with onions, mushrooms, bell peppers, and probably other vegetables.  It was really, really good.  So good, in fact, that I worked up the nerve to try the stomach part of the meal.  \r\n\r\nStomach slow cooked in a sauce tastes a lot better then you might expect.  The stomach itself didn't really add much in the way of flavor.  It just tasted like the sauce.  The texture was kind of slippery, but not nearly as slick as a piece of sushi.  Also, it wasn't too tough or chewy.  Just a sort of neutral bite of okay food."

In other words, I've pretty much kept up the routine that I described in the last post, but I am indeed ready to go home.\r\n\r\nThere are a few moderately amusing things from the office this week.\r\n<!--more-->\r\n<ul><li>One day, there was a power outage.  The power only went off for a few seconds, but it was long enough to turn off people's computers.  When it came back on, there were a few people who just sat there staring at their monitors, which were showing that \"check input signal\" moving box that they do to show you that there's no video signal coming through.  Loretta -- the technical expert on the floor -- had to leave the room and instruct some of them to power their workstations back on.\r\n\r\nNo shit.<\/li>\r\n\r\n<li>There's one particular guy who really, really, really wanted to make sure that we went shopping for gifts back home.  At the end of every day, he would recommend that we do some shopping that night.  Every morning, he would ask, \"Did you get a chance to do any shopping?\"\r\n\r\nIt was funny in its predictability.  I asked if his wife owned a souvenir shop in Waikiki, but that wasn't it.\r\n\r\nI'm traveling with another guy, who is in his 20s.  There's about as much chance that we cruise through the mall together as there is that the water I've been swimming in every evening is teaming with jellyfish.\r\n\r\n(Come to find out, the water I've been swimming in every evening is indeed teaming with jellyfish.  I just caught the report on CNN after I came up from my swim today.  The location that they shot was immediately in front of my hotel.  Pretty much exactly where I've been swimming.)\r\n\r\n<table cellpadding=\"2\" align=\"right\"><tr><td width=\"5\" rowspan=\"2\"><spacer type=\"block\" width=\"5\" height=\"1\"><\/td><td><img src=\"\/img\/hawaii-clouds.jpg\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td class=\"caption\" >I took this photo of a kind of cool looking cloud formation from my room.<\/td><\/tr><\/table>\r\n\r\nThe story I got was that it was an attempt to make sure that I went home with generosity.  Everyone we dealt with at the bank was exceptionally nice.  I've not experienced better hospitality anywhere.  They put the hotel and restaurant staff to shame.  And they wanted to make sure that we spread the goodwill back home.  And I do believe this explanation.<\/li>\r\n\r\n<li>Perhaps the funniest thing about this week was the fiasco that was the parking garage at the facility where I worked.  They built a very large building with a parking garage underneath.  But whoever did the design for the facility failed to estimate the number of desks that would be in the building, or failed to equate the number of desks with the number of parking spots needed.\r\n\r\nThe result is that they have to have a staff down in the garage to move cars all around during the day.  You park down there in a long line in the morning, and leave your keys for them.  They shuffle cars around throughout the day.\r\n\r\nWhen you're ready to leave at the end of the day, there's a peg board in the lobby with all of the remaining keys hanging from hooks.  A valet tag on your keys lets you know which spot your car occupies.\r\n\r\nJust consider the expense of this valet staff.  Also figure in the costs to their health, with the constant breathing of carbon monoxide.  It's a doozy of a garage.\r\n\r\nEven the people with reserved spots don't have it that good.  On one side of the garage, they have to double up.  So the first person to get there pulls way into a spot, and then the next person just parks right behind them.  I guess if you're on the inside and have to leave, you have to track down your parking spot partner.  This garage is really something to behold.<\/li>\r\n\r\n<li>One of the credit bureau products is known as a \"FICO score.\"  We usually pronounce it as \"FIE-co.\"  I heard one person this week call it the \"FEE-co\" score.  I had to get her to repeat it three times, and I still wasn't sure what she was saying.  It sounds like the result of a test that your veterinarian would run on your cat.  As in, \"Your cat's feeco is a little low.  I think we might want to get him started on an antibiotic.\"<\/li><\/ul>\r\n\r\nI have been eating like a pig.  Honolulu has the biggest selection of Asian and Pacific foods that I have ever imagined.  I have eaten Thai, Teppan, Sushi, Dim Sum (they actually have duck feet, which I didn't get the chance to witness), Hawaiian, as well as a couple of fish dishes and a burger one night that really hit the spot.\r\n\r\n<table cellpadding=\"2\" align=\"right\"><tr><td width=\"5\" rowspan=\"2\"><spacer type=\"block\" width=\"5\" height=\"1\"><\/td><td width=\"250\" ><img src=\"\/img\/hawaiianfood.jpg\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td class=\"caption\" width=\"250\">Hawaiian Food<\/td><\/tr><\/table>\r\n\r\nHawaiian food kicks serious hula-skirted booty.  Laulau was one of my favorites.  Think of a stuffed grape leaf, but the size of a regular sandwich.  I also really liked Luau Squid, which looked like a bright green paste.  It had the coconut-milk taste of a curry dish, but wasn't spicy.  The squid was as tender as a piece of fish.  All of the Hawaiian food was fantastic.\r\n\r\nBesides food the words, I learned a little Hawaiian this week.  \r\n\r\nPUKA = holes in information.  \"I've read over your request, but there's a lot of <i>puka<\/i> to resolve before I'm able to prepare an estimate.\"\r\n\r\nPAU = done.  \"This trip is one day from being <i>pau<\/i>.\"  I like this one, mainly because it sounds like \"POW!\"\r\n\r\nBut there were few anecdotes about being out and about that are worth sharing.  In fact, there is only this one.\r\n\r\nI was walking the beach one night, heading back toward my hotel.  I had stopped in front of a little bar, trying to decide if I should stick to my abstinence of alcohol (so far, so good on that, but I'm feeling adequately detoxed, and might end my self-imposed ban later tonight), or if I should keep walking.  Not being willing to forgo vice altogether, I had purchased a decent cigar, and was kind of looking forward to smoking that on my balcony.  But still, the bar looked fun, and I was tempted.\r\n\r\nI got to talking to a hippie who was at the edge of the bar and the sand.  He explained that it was illegal for him to smoke his cigarettes in the bar and illegal for him to drink his cocktail on the beach.  He had found that he could stand at the edge and enjoy both of his poisons without being accosted by anyone.\r\n\r\nHe was a nice guy, and we bullshit for a little while.  Mostly, it was him telling me information, as he had lived on the island for a number of years.  \r\n\r\nWhen he explained to me about the no-drinking\/no-smoking conundrum, I expressed my sympathy.  I happened to mention, \"I was just walking back to my hotel to have a smoke on the balcony.\"\r\n\r\nHe quickly offered a cigarette, which I immediately declined.  He said, \"Ooohhh, you mean to smoke the real stuff.\"\r\n\r\nAs his implication began to be clear to me, he went on to explain that the marijuana that you get in Hawaii is of very top-notch quality.  He told me about how much he used to smoke pot when he lived here, and how he just can't find such good stuff back on the mainland.  He said that the locals pretty much stick with pot, as alcohol dehydrates a body and makes it difficult and dangerous to ride surfboards all day.\r\n\r\nI have to admit that I found his lecture kind of interesting, and never once did I correct his notion that I was headed back to my room to smoke a bit fatty.\r\n\r\n"

Of course, there's the excitement that you're going to such an awesome destination, but then again, you're being sent away for business, so you spend your days working while you know that all of your co-guests at the hotel are swimming, taking in sights, and doing generally fun vacation things.  You get back to the hotel at 6:00 pm, just in time to see all of the beautiful tan people head in to wash the salt and sand out of their cracks and to hit the nightlife.  You, on the other hand, have time for a swim, a bite, and a relatively early bed time.\r\n<!--more-->\r\nNowhere does the fact that you aren't a tourist hit home more than the early morning.  I've been waking up early, getting a coffee, and taking a long morning walk on the beach.  It's just an excellent, excellent way to start the day.  But then when the walk is over, it is TORTURE to go up, shower, and put on workplace-appropriate clothes.  The worst part is the elevator ride down, wearing kakhis -- PANTS!

(Although I cut my foot on a pice of coral while swimming yesterday evening, and it sure does bother me now.  I'm not counting on sympathy.)\r\n\r\nMrs. theskinnyonbenny would love this place for the summer weather.  High temperatures in the 80s appear to be among the coolest in the nation this week.  The sky is clear and blue rather than the hazy vanilla blue that I'm used to seeing in the summer time.  Ten degrees cooler and it would be football weather.\r\n\r\nMrs. theskinnyonbenny tops the list of who I wish could be here, but she's not the only one.  The hotel hosted a party sponsored by the Bicardi distributor on Sunday night.  It was a fun party, but I couldn't help but think that if Eddie or the Sharples had been here, we would have shown all of the young college-aged kids how to really throw down.  We might have ended up in jail, but they would all still be telling stories on us.\r\n\r\n<table cellpadding=\"2\" align=\"right\"><tr><td width=\"5\" rowspan=\"2\"><spacer type=\"block\" width=\"5\" height=\"1\"><\/td><td width=\"500\" ><img src=\"\/img\/hawaii-outrigger.jpg\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td class=\"caption\" width=\"250\">This is the finish of an outrigger race Sunday morning<\/td><\/tr><\/table>\r\n\r\nThe party featured a DJ and several cash bars on a pool deck and lawn right in front of the ocean.  I have some standards when it comes to rum, so I stuck to beer.  Their beer choices were Budweiser and Bud light, seved in bottle-shaped aluminum.  I thought at first that they were those lined bottles to keep beer colder, but in fact, they were the worst of all worlds.  The taller narrow bottle shaped and heat conducting aluminum conspired to ensure that you could not possibly drink a whole beer in the time that it took the beer to get warm.  The bottle-shaped can is a horrible, horrible invention that should go the way of the dodo bird as quickly as possible.\r\n\r\nI didn't drink enough warm beer to do anything regretable, but I did tell a guy that he had made a good choice in which girls to hit on, only to be told, \"Dawg, that's my cousin!\"  He wasn't too mad about it though.  \r\n\r\nI think I had six beers, but I only got charged for half of them, thanks to a very nice but incompetant waiter.  I talked to him a lot, and as I closed out the tab, he confessed that it was his first day on the job.  I gave a generous tip, understanding that he had a tough assignment for the first day, and as thanks for putting half of my beers on someone else's bill.\r\n\r\n<table cellpadding=\"2\" align=\"right\"><tr><td width=\"5\" rowspan=\"2\"><spacer type=\"block\" width=\"5\" height=\"1\"><\/td><td width=\"250\" ><img src=\"\/img\/hawaii-falls.jpg\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td class=\"caption\" width=\"250\">The little spec beneath the waterfall is me.  This was also on Sunday.<\/td><\/tr><\/table>\r\n\r\nI saw the same waiter this evening, and he clearly remembered me.  I didn't order a drink, and I didn't have the heart to admit that I've given up the sauce for a short time.  I'm not on some moral high ground or anything.  It's just that I had our New York trip, followed by Fourth of July weekend, followed by Mrs. theskinnyonbenny's birthday, followed by this hotel party.  All of these have involved a lot of drinks, and I'm feeling the need to detox for a while.\r\n\r\nMy goal is to abstain from now until the start of college football, about five weeks from now.  That's approximately four and a half weeks longer than I've gone without drinking since I started at LSU in 1989.  Wish me well.\r\n\r\nGetting back to island-related topics, I've noticed that the Hawaiian words use only the letters H, K, L, M, N, P, W, plus all of the vowels.  If the natives had an alphabet before the Europeans arrived, all they needed was a dozen letters.\r\n\r\nThere seems to be a rule that vowels can be all strung together, but there can never be two consonants in a row.  So KLAUWI can't be a Hawaiian word, but WALIOPIPI, KIOLU'U'UPEA, and POUAWA'APOLOLOMEAMEALU would be fine.\r\n\r\nSince there are only so many syllables that you can make with these rules, you have to make your words pretty long if you want them to be unique.  (It reminds me of the <i>Futurama<\/i> episode where they find a new food, do a trademark search, and find that the only word not already used for a product is \"Popplers.\")  The end result of all of this is that all of the words with Hawaiian roots look pretty similar.  Finding a particular street is an excercise in examining the finest details of street signs, since pretty much every street name looks the same at a glance.  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n"

We Sopranos fans are a patient group.\r\n\r\nWith the end of that series, Entourage and Curb Your Enthusiasm become the only two series for which I would be willing to subscribe.  (I like Big Love too, but wouldn't pay extra just to see it.)  But it would be difficult to justify the monthly charge just on the strength of a couple of half-hour comedies.\r\n<!--more-->\r\nThen again, maybe I would with Entourage.  It's one of the few shows where I have that experience where you see the closing credits and look immediately to the clock, hoping that it can't possibly be time for the show to end already.\r\n\r\nThe shame is that no one I talk to watches this show, and I never get to talk about it.  Let me give you a quick rundown, so that the next part of this post is as funny as it should be.  If you watch, skip the next section.\r\n\r\nThe show is about a movie star, his agent, and his buddies.  The main story line ending last season and going into this season is that the star was cast as the lead in <i>Aquaman<\/i> -- a made up movie.  At the beginning of this season, the movie premiered, and broke <i>Spiderman's<\/i> record for opening weekend sales.\r\n\r\nThe publicity folks at HBO took out an advertising in one of the real trades congratulating the fake movie for its box office success.  It generated some buzz for the show, and that should have been the end of a not-very-interesting story.\r\n<embed src=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/v\/YPvorO0EGIY\" type=\"application\/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"425\" height=\"350\"><\/embed>\r\n\r\nUntil a donkey at CNBC got hold of this information, put it into a script, and got another donkey named Joe Kernan to report it as if it were true.  This video is top-notch.  In fact, that's really the whole point of this post:  to make you see what a fool this guy is.  I don't really care if you watch HBO or not.\r\n\r\nBut have you seen the new lineup on Showtime?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

What on earth is a buhTAtuh?\"\r\n\r\nSilence.  It's tough to rope mom in.\r\n\r\n\"Did you mean potatoes?  Potatoes sound good.  Can we have those instead of buhTAtuhs?\"\r\n\r\nBut she would never dignify my merrymaking with a response.\r\n\r\nAlthough I haven't done it much here, I get a lot of comedic mileage from making fun of my mom's cooking.  I won't get into it much here, but it's a telling fact that most of my family thinks the food at Red Lobster is good.\r\n\r\nHere's another mean thing that I did as a teenager:\r\n\r\nMom cooked up some sort of stew or casserole one night.  I don't remember what it was -- only that it was a bunch of food scrambled together in a bowl.  As soon as it was set in front of me, I put the bowl on the ground and said, \"Here kitty kitty kitty.\"\r\n\r\nIt makes me laugh to recall this scene, but it would chap my hide in a big way if I ever had a kid who did that to me.  And as I recall, she was pretty annoyed at it all.\r\n\r\nEven though I make fun, I always ate every bite of food put in front of me.  The one exception was a dish that she really liked, a Beef Stroganoff.  The way she made it included a healthy portion of beets  (aka the anti-food).  I know a lot of people who claim to like beets, and I've seen them eat enough to believe that the really do.  But I don't understand <i>how<\/i> they could really like them.  Beets are the nastiest, most foul tasting root ever to grow beneath a weed.\r\n\r\nWhen we were in New York, Mrs. theskinnyonbenny was enjoying a soup in a Russian restaurant one afternoon.  It looked good, and I asked for a bite.  I was completely unsuspicious of its purple color and even asked, \"Is that cabbage?\"\r\n\r\nThe bite went into my mouth, and I just enough time to say, \"Yeah, that's pretty good,\" before the beet-aftertaste hit me.  It was a little like someone puked in my mouth, but without the acidy burn that puke carries with it.\r\n\r\nYum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Putting this in writing makes me realize that it's odd behavior, but I'm sure it was to make some point or other.  Amanda asked, \"Goodness, you aren't riding your bike any more?\"\r\n\r\nThe embarrassing part is that I have indeed been riding some.  \r\n<!--more-->\r\nThe other time was even less expected.  I was coming from the front of the house after resetting a song back to its beginning.  I had done that because I had taken too many Pisco Sours (more on that later), and wanted to dance a little, and this song was striking me right.  As I was shaking my tail on the way back to where all of the people were, I crossed paths with Eddie on his way to the bathroom.\r\n\r\nHe laughed and said, \"Man!  You need to lose some damn weight!\"  Apparently my gut was bouncing around like Santa Claus after a Krispy Kreme binge.  Honest friends:  at least I have that going for me.\r\n\r\n<EMBED  type=\"application\/x-mplayer2\" src=\"\/sound\/AverageMan.mp3\" autostart=\"0\" showcontrols=\"1\"   height=\"50\" border=\"1\" align=\"right\" \/><noembed>You will just have to imagine the tune.

There was some worry about heavy rain in the morning getting in our way, but it cleared up just before 12:00, and stayed dry through the afternoon.  We cooked and drank all afternoon.\r\n\r\n<table cellpadding=\"2\" align=\"right\"><tr><td width=\"5\" rowspan=\"2\"><spacer type=\"block\" width=\"5\" height=\"1\"><\/td><td width=\"250\" ><img src=\"\/img\/bellman.jpg\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td class=\"caption\" width=\"250\">Mrs. theskinnyonbenny shows a concierge all about the Pegu, which he hadn't known about.<\/td><\/tr><\/table>\r\n\r\nHeather mixed drinks based on lessons that she learned while we were in New York last Wednesday through Saturday.  I mentioned the Pisco Sour, which was <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Pisco\" target=\"_blank\">Pisco<\/a>, lime juice, some other mixer that I can't remember, and an egg white, shaken and served on the rocks with a few drops of bitters.  It was very, very good.\r\n\r\nOur New York cocktail tour started at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.peguclub.com\/flash\/\" target=\"_blank\">Pegu<\/a>.  Over the next few days we continued to other higher-end bars and sampled from their drink specialties.  It was a good way to spend a long weekend, and I have no regrets about having missed the Statue of Liberty.\r\n\r\nThe main reason for flying to New York was that we had tickets to Madonna last Thursday night.  As you might expect, Madonna put on a hell of a show, with tons of acrobatic dancers, lights, video, etc.  The show went for a full two hours, with many set and costume changes that all happened while other things were going on, so there was never a break in the music.  \r\n\r\n<table cellpadding=\"2\" align=\"right\"><tr><td width=\"5\" rowspan=\"2\"><spacer type=\"block\" width=\"5\" height=\"1\"><\/td><td width=\"250\" ><img src=\"\/img\/madonnastage.jpg\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td class=\"caption\" width=\"250\">The stage.<\/td><\/tr><\/table>\r\n\r\nHere are a few other cool things about the show:\r\n\r\n<ul><li>Knowing that there was a \"riding a horse\" portion of the show, I predicted Madonna straddling one of the dancers, all covered in leather in a pseudo-horse ride type of thing.  That played out before Madonna even hit the stage, with pairs of dancers.  Madonna appeared when a disco ball lowered from the sky, and after the horse-people pranced around some, the disco ball opened like a space pod to reveal Esther herself.  And then mounted a dancer's back to start singing.  I am money.<\/li>\r\n\r\n<li>If you've seen any press about the show, you know about the part where she rides up and down on a saddle (which was on a stage spur right near us), and about the cross of mirrors.  If you haven't done your homework, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.thesop.org\/article.php?id=1488\">this article<\/a> is pretty good.<\/li>\r\n\r\n<table cellpadding=\"2\" align=\"right\"><tr><td width=\"5\" rowspan=\"2\"><spacer type=\"block\" width=\"5\" height=\"1\"><\/td><td width=\"250\" ><img src=\"\/img\/madonnahorse.jpg\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td class=\"caption\" width=\"250\">The horse riding thing.<\/td><\/tr><\/table>\r\n\r\n<li>The most common question I get asked is, \"Did she sing any of her old songs?\"  Fortunately, in my opinion, she kept those to a minimum.  I can remember three songs from the 80s, so let's say there were four or so.  Lucky Star was sung to the beat of Hung Up -- that latest MTV hit, with the dancing around the ugly room in a leotard -- and one of the others was put to the beat of a (Donna Summer?) disco hit.  So it really didn't seem like we were subjected to much 80s Madonna pop music.  I get the feeling that Madonna dislikes that old stuff as much as I do.\r\n\r\nBy the way, I remembered the details of what songs went with what beats much better directly after the show, but the specifics fail me these many days later.<\/li><\/ul>\r\n\r\nThere's some footage from this tour on YouTube.  <a href=\"http:\/\/youtube.com\/watch?v=nt-b7wV0AzE&search=madonna%20concert\r\n\" target=\"_blank\">This one was a good one<\/a>, although not chronologically correct.\r\n\r\nWe went to the show with three gay couples.  As this show sort of capped off gay pride week in New York, there were not that many apparently straight males to be seen.  I'm not sure that I saw any others, but there were probably 12 or 15 of us in the crowd of 25,000 people.  But of course, I'm just guessing.\r\n\r\nToward the end of the show, Madonna dropped a white disco suit looking outfit to reveal a swimsuit looking dance thing.  When she did that, there was a guy's voice behind me that said in awe, \"Look at that Ass!\"\r\n\r\n<table cellpadding=\"2\" align=\"right\"><tr><td width=\"5\" rowspan=\"2\"><spacer type=\"block\" width=\"5\" height=\"1\"><\/td><td width=\"250\" ><img src=\"\/img\/madonna2.jpg\"><\/td><\/tr><tr><td class=\"caption\" width=\"250\">Madge in the white disco outfit.<\/td><\/tr><\/table>\r\n\r\nI turned around with arm in air to high-five someone who was like-minded, but when I saw the guy, it was clear that he was just another homosexual, whose awe meant, \"Man, I'm really impressed with her dedication to leg lifts,\" rather than the intention that I thought he meant:  \"I'm not sure these seats are worth $186, but I would gladly pay four times that amount to slap one of those cheeks.\"  Even though it was clear to us both that we were on different pages, he gamely participated in my high-five.\r\n\r\nI should elaborate on the seats.  They were expensive, and they were close, but they were directly to the side of the stage.  It was kind of cool to be able to see how they quickly changed out sets and props, but annoying to see a lot of backsides, and miss the video behind the stage altogether.  We had to wander around and watch from where we could, occasionally being bounced by a creepy usher-type.  That was by far the most annoying part of the whole trip.\r\n\r\nBeing both straight, and directly to the side of the stage, I bet I was the only guy who noticed the lights dancing over Messier's retired number at the top of the Garden.  I didn't see any Knicks numbers, but I couldn't see the whole top circle.  Surely, they've retired at least a couple of numbers in their history.  Ewing must be up there somewhere, right?\r\n\r\nAnyway, after the show, we went to a bar across the street to cool down.  (It had been kept very hot in the arena.)  It was more of a sports bar type of place, whose usual crowd is probably post-basketball or hockey fans.  We got to talking to a couple of nice English people and had a really nice time.  Mrs. theskinnyonbenny was offered a free triple of whatever she was drinking, plus a free beer for me and both Brits, if she would only give up her brassiere to the bartender.  Unfortunately, she held out for eight free drinks rather than six, and an agreement couldn't be reached.  Not that we needed any more drinks.\r\n\r\nI have one more story before I complete this backwards chronology of my past week.\r\n\r\nWhen we first got to New York, we were walking out of the airport.  We passed through a group of drivers trying to sell a ride into the city outside of the normal taxi line.  The first guy we talked to gave me too high a price, but the second guy had a reasonable offer, so we followed him to his car.\r\n\r\nHe motored along without incident until we got to the Midtown Tunnel.  A tunnel cop (honest to God, his uniform indicated that he was truly nothing more than a tunnel cop) busted out of the toll booth and yelled for our driver to stop.\r\n\r\nHe stopped the other lanes so that he could make our driver pull over.  He came to the window and chastised our guy for having a cracked windshield.\r\n\r\nI was right behind the driver, and Tunnel Cop asked me to roll down the window and produce some ID.  That was annoying, but I handed him my license.\r\n\r\nHe used that to grill the driver about who I was.  He had claimed to be driving \"friends,\" since he didn't have a taxi drivers' license.  The cop took his stuff and went to his palace -- a booth about 4 feet square, to write tickets for the guy.\r\n\r\nHe was in there for 20 minutes.  Finally, he came back out and returned my license to me.  Then he started explaining the normal stuff about your court date and bench warrants and all of that crap to the driver.  The driver looked straight ahead.\r\n\r\nTunnel Cop interrupted his own spiel.  \"SIR I'M OVER HERE.  LOOK AT ME WHEN I TALK TO YOU.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can hear you just fine.  I don't have to look at your face to be listening to what you say.\"  Our driver had the accent of a Caribbean or African.\r\n\r\n\"I DIDN'T F--KING ASK YOU, I TOLD YOU TO LOOK AT ME.  YOU WILL GIVE ME THE F--KING RESPECT THAT I DESERVE.\"  (respect?  deserve?  please.)\r\n\r\nThe driver stayed very calm, but didn't look him in the face either.  Tunnel Cop finally lost the last shred of his cool and threw the tickets in the window at him.\r\n\r\nWe pulled away, and Mrs. theskinnyonbenny observed that Tunnel Cop must have a very small penis.\r\n\r\n"

I dragged her into the house, but she just went back out the door and started up again.  Blossom is her faithful sidekick, and hung out outside with the crazy beagle.\r\n<!--more-->\r\nAfter my one warning trip outside, Lili got stuffed into the garage to spend the night.  Ever-loyal, Blossom went in with her to stay as well.\r\n\r\nThis wouldn't make me feel bad by itself, but little do they know that tonight they will be spending the night in a kennel at the vet's office.  And the next two nights after that.  To top it off, Blossom is getting her belly opened and her reproductive system removed tomorrow night.  So really, she wouldn't have wanted to spend the night on the garage floor had she known all of that.\r\n\r\nI imagine that some of you will think I'm a real jerk.  Especially those who heard only my side of a conversation with Mrs. theskinnyonbenny yesterday.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>(General Greetings, etc.)\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\n\"Well, okay, but you can't be in my way.  You'll have to sit out back with the dogs.\"\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\n\"A couple of hours.\"\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\n\"Well, hey, you're the one crimping my style.\"<\/blockquote>\r\n\r\nI don't sound like quite the a-hole when you see the whole conversation:\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\"I think I'm going to skip my thing tonight and just come home.  But will you still mop the floors like you said you would?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, okay, but you can't be in my way.  You'll have to sit out back with the dogs.\"\r\n\r\n\"How long will I have to stay back there?\"\r\n\r\n\"A couple of hours.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hours!!??  Maybe I'll just go somewhere else then.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, hey, you're the one crimping my style.\"<\/blockquote>\r\n\r\nSee?  I'm not the bastard that I seemed to be.  And I did mop the floors, followed by a coat of polish.  The couple of hours included both steps, plus drying time.\r\n\r\nThat's the kind of thing that I do in those stretches where I don't post for a long while.  In addition to writing a decent blog (and pimping myself for links from other bloggers), here are the hobbies that I would choose if I had more time on my hands.\r\n\r\n<ul><li>I would learn to tie really cool knots.  Monkey's fists and Turks heads and the like.  I've seen rope tied into big boat fenders.  People who figure that stuff out can do some really, really cool things.<\/li>\r\n\r\n<li>Play video games.  Yeah, I'm a nerd, but if I had a lot more free time and money, I would be whipping up on you nerds on the XBox.<\/li>\r\n\r\n<li>I've probably mentioned that I like to make up stupid little songs, often juvenile in nature.  You might not know that I have a ukulele so that I could learn to give myself some musical accompaniment.  But I've never taken the time to learn the first chord.  One day, perhaps.  The biggest problem here is that I need to find someone to show me how to tune it first.  And I'm too ashamed to go around asking, \"Anyone know how to tune a ukulele?\"<\/li>\r\n\r\n<li>I would get good at golf, but in secret.  I would still let everyone think that I don't play at all, but then when it came time to be dragged into an unwanted game, I would be sensational.  And then, I would be like, \"What, this is hard for you?  I guess I'm just a natural.\"<\/li>\r\n\r\n<li>I would get good at crossword puzzles.  I like to solve hard puzzles, and it makes me feel smart to solve a whole block of clues.  Unfortunately, I'm nowhere near good enough to solve a whole, difficult puzzle.  Easy puzzles don't interest me, and I'm not good enough for the hard ones.  <\/li>\r\n\r\n<li>I would take up fishing.  I go once in a while, but I would actually learn good spots to go, what kind of lures to use, and buy a nice boat to fish from.  If I had more time.  And more money.  Which I don't.<\/li><\/ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n<center><img src=\"\/img\/greenline.gif\"><\/center>\r\n\r\n\r\nWe're about to embark on a long weekend trip, so this is probably my last post this week.

A quick \"be careful, love you, yada yada,\" and I peeled out of the airport loading lane, free for a day and a half to myself.\r\n\r\nI stopped at a tobacco store, bought three really nice cigars (which I got for a very reasonable price, plus got a fourth cigar for free).  I ducked into the convenience store next door and added a six-pack of beer to my purchases.  Then, I headed for the back yard.  \r\n<!--more-->\r\nI opened a cold beer, put on some tunes, and took off the majority of my clothes.  I sat back there for a couple of hours smoking, drinking, and reading a book, all by myself.  It was awesome.\r\n\r\nWhile the rest of this experience is pretty much standard fare for me, I don't normally treat myself to a good cigar.  In fact, I don't really smoke them more than a couple times a year.  I found myself wondering how the smoke can stink to high heaven on the lit in, but have such a nice taste (kind of nutty) on the mouth in.  It's the same smoke from the same tobacco.  Is there some interaction with the saliva that changes it from foul to pleasant?\r\n\r\nSince I'm a rare smoker, the big stogie gave me a little buzz.  Believe me in this -- I'm not a rare beer drinker, and the one Carona didn't give me the buzz.  The lightheadedness and disappearing light made it difficult to read, so I ordered a to-go box of Outback cheese fries to eat for dinner.\r\n\r\nI ordered from there for two reasons.  First, I remembered their cheese fries being really, really good.  Not only do they put plenty of cheese, but they top it off with bacon.  And they serve it with a pint of ranch dressing, in case the fry grease, cheese, and bacon don't make it quite bad enough for you.  (They did turn out to be good, but not quite as good as I had remembered.)\r\n\r\nThe other reason I ordered from there was that I knew they bring the take-out orders right to your car.  So I didn't really have to get dressed.  I did throw on a T-shirt, because, well, who wants to see my gut in a roll over the seatbelt strap?  I'm courteous that way.\r\n\r\nWhen I got my box back home, I fed my face like Cookie Monster.  That is, my left hand would be stuffing cheese fries down my gullet as fast as I could swallow, while my right hand was loading up another fistful of fries.  I'm not sure how I avoided suffocation, as there was never a point where my mouth wasn't full.\r\n\r\nThose who have seen me eat are saying to themselves, \"Oh yeah.  Gross.  I've seen him when he eats like that.\"  To you, I say \"au contraire.\"  I was so gross that I made the <i>dogs<\/i> lose their appetites.  Did I mention the grease dripping down my wrists?  No chance a napkin was going to get near them.\r\n\r\nAfter that, I shoved the remains of my meal back into the bag, wiped my hands and mouth on that T-shirt, and watched bad movies all night.\r\n\r\n<div><center><img src=\"\/img\/greenline.gif\"><\/center>\r\n\r\n<div><table cellpadding=\"2\" align=\"center\"><tr><td width=\"5\" rowspan=\"2\"><spacer type=\"block\" width=\"5\" height=\"1\"><\/td><td width=\"250\" ><img src=\"\/img\/kkcheeseburger.jpg\"><\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/div>\r\n\r\n<div>While we're on the subject of gluttony, I saw this sandwich in <a href=\"http:\/\/www.usatoday.com\/money\/industries\/food\/2006-06-23-cheeseburger-usat_x.htm\" target=\"_blank\">today's USA today.<\/a>  It's a bacon cheeseburger, with the buns replaced by a sliced Krispy Kreme doughnut.  1000 calories, 45 grams of fat.

		"post_content" : "I got to thinking about <em>Three's Company<\/em> today.  And I've decided that a big part of why it's no big deal for people of my generation to have opposite-sex roommates is that our parents spent so much time in 1979 defending Jack's right to cohabitate with Janet and Chrissy.  I know this sounds ludicrous, but I remember that it really was a controversy when that show was a prime-time series.\r\n\r\nMy parents would have been of that age where they are about 10 years older than our fictional Southern California friends.  I now know that people in their 30s want to think that they are as young and hip as the attractive people in their 20s that they see on the television every week.  I bet a good many of those people had drawn-out debates with their own parents about the morality of this silly little sitcom.\r\n<!--more-->\r\nFast forward 20 years, and their own kids want to live the lifestyle that the parents convinced themselves was moral way back when.  <em>Three's Company<\/em> changed how they perceived \"living in sin.\"\r\n\r\n(That sounds preachy, but unintentionally.  In fact, I strongly recommend a childless live-together period for all young couples before getting married.)\r\n\r\nIt's often commented on that the plot of every episode revolves around an eavesdropper overhearing a piece of a conversation, misinterpreting it, usually in a sexual way, followed by the ensuing hilarity.  The running gag that is less often mentioned is the unfulfilled sexual advance.  Jack would get shot down by Janet (Janet?  Is that the best looking brunette they could find?) and Chrissy.  Lana would get shot down by Jack.  Larry would get shot down by pretty much everyone -- although he hooked up regularly with extras, Mr. Ferley would get shot down by extras on a regular basis, and Mrs. Roper is probably the only wife in the history of the world who constantly got shot down by her own husband.  Good stuff.\r\n\r\nIt's hard to understand whether Mr. Ferley and Mr. Roper were conservative fuddy-duddies, or pretty progressive dudes.  On the one hand, they would put their foot down and disallow a heterosexual cohabitation.  Mr. Roper was especially adamant about it not happening under his roof.  But on the other hand, they had no problem with the perceived open homosexuality of Jack.  I'm pretty sure that there were episodes where they assumed that other males were with Jack.\r\n\r\nThis brings me to the profound conclusion that Mr. Roper -- of all people -- is more open minded than the current President of the United States, who as you have probably heard, has proposed amending the constitution in a way that protects the rest of us from the dangers associated with homosexual couples being able to inherit each others belongings, share an insurance plan, or visit each other in the hospital.\r\n\r\nI wonder if the President was a <em>Three's Company<\/em> fan, and how he would compare himself to Mr. Roper.  (He certainly did better in the wife-picking department.  But wouldn't you pay a hundred bucks to see what Laura looks like in a muu muu?)\r\n\r\nAn what was Mr. Ferley's problem with a heterosexual living with two girls?  He fancied himself a playa, and would have engaged in out-of-marriage intercourse as often as he could get it.  So what, exactly, is his problem with the living arrangement upstairs?\r\n\r\nIt occurs to me now that I should have given John Ritter a little mention on this site when he passed away.  Not because he was one of the last masters of the pratfall -- which he was, and not because his similar minor characters in <em>Sling Blade<\/em> and <em>Bad Santa<\/em> helped push those movies from good to among my favorites of all time -- which he did.\r\n\r\nNo, the real reason that he deserves to be singled out is that he is the biggest celebrity to have shared a birthday with me.  In fact, now that he's passed, I don't know of another celeb with a September 17 birthday (that's a hint -- mark your calendars).\r\n\r\nOne Summer during my college days, I lived with my buddies Jerry and Eddie.  Jerry spent most of his time at a girlfriend's, so it was usually Eddie and me hanging around the apartment.  Every day when I would get in from work, Eddie was winding up an hour-long session of back to back episodes of <em>Three's Company<\/em>.  We would pretty much start drinking beer right then.\r\n\r\nOne day, one of us decided to check directory assistance for the town where Three's Company was set.  I don't remember which Southern California city that was any more, but we called looking for the phone number of a Jack Tripper with no luck, then of a Chrissy Snow, again with no luck.  But what do you know, there was a Janet Woods listed.  Of course, we gave her a call.\r\n\r\nEddie called that first night and seemed to have a nice chat about liking flowers, living with a closed-minded landlord, the importance of getting the whole story before making decisions based on one's eavesdropping, etc.  When he finally hung up, I was insanely jealous of not having been the one to think this up.\r\n\r\nHe mentioned that she seemed not to know what he was talking about.  As if she never considered the coincidence of her unfortunate name.\r\n\r\n<EMBED  src=\"\/sound\/IDontAccept.wav\" autostart=\"0\" showcontrols=\"1\"   height=\"50\" border=\"1\" align=\"right\"><noembed>You will just have to imagine an old, drugged out \"I don't accept.\"  Your browser doesn't support this plugin.<\/noembed>\r\n\r\nWe continued to call her, but I suggested that since we were rather poor college students, that we call collect.  So every night, after getting a buzz, we'd dial her up via the collect call operator.  The way it worked was that a voice tells you to say your name.  Some piece of equipment makes a recording of what you say, and then when the person answers the phone, the voice says something like, \"Press 1 to accept a collect call from...\" and then plays back your recording.\r\n\r\nAt the part where you record your name, we would always yell something like, \"THIS IS MR. FERLEY, AND I NEED YOU TO PAY THE RENT!\" or \"THIS IS MR. ANGELENO!  TELL JACK TO GET TO WORK!\"\r\n\r\nJanet sounded like an older, tired, possibly drug-addled Californian.  She was nothing at all like the Janet that we know from the series.  Her answer was always the same words, but I can't do them justice by just typing them here.  I've made a little sound file of my impression of the answer.  Listen and enjoy.\r\n\r\nTo this day, referring to any young, dark-haired, sort chick as Janet Woods cracks me up."

She kept waiving her hands under the faucet but was puzzled as to why the water would not flow.  \r\nFrustrated, she looked over at me and inquired, \"do any of these work?\"  \r\nI replied, \"yes, turn the nob.\" \r\nShe manually turned the faucet on and washed in silence.  \r\nI've seen people struggle with turning on sinks with sensors, but never the reverse.  I'm beginning to recognize gaps between mine and the next generation.\r\n<\/blockquote>\r\n\r\nI know what you're thinking.  Posting this puts me right there with that dumb shit columnist <a href=\"http:\/\/www.2theadvocate.com\/columnists\/smiley\/\r\n\" target=\"_blank\">Smiley Anders<\/a>.  Insulting, but all too true.\r\n\r\n<center><img src=\"\/img\/greenline.gif\"\/><\/center>\r\n\r\n<table cellpadding=\"2\" align=\"right\"><tr><td width=\"5\" rowspan=\"2\"><spacer type=\"block\" width=\"5\" height=\"1\"><\/spacer><\/td><td width=\"250\" ><img src=\"\/img\/pickles.jpg\"\/ width=\"230\"\/><\/td><\/tr><tr><td class=\"caption\" width=\"250\">Pickles<\/td><\/tr><\/table>\r\n\r\nCheck out this bin of pickles at the Subway yesterday.  And this was at 1:30 in the afternoon.  Just to mess with the lady, I told her how to dress my sandwich like this,\r\n\r\n\"tomatoes, onion, and ... oh are you out of pickles?\"\r\n\r\nShe thought I was serious, and gave my face a close examination to determine whether I was insane or just an imbecile.  It gave me a good laugh, but I was the only one who thought it was funny.\r\n\r\n<center><img src=\"\/img\/greenline.gif\"\/><\/center>\r\n\r\n<table cellpadding=\"2\" align=\"left\"><tr><td width=\"5\" rowspan=\"2\"><spacer type=\"block\" width=\"5\" height=\"1\"><\/spacer><\/td><td width=\"250\" ><img src=\"\/img\/turkshead.jpg\"\/ width=\"190\"\/><\/td><\/tr><tr><td class=\"caption\" width=\"250\">A plainish Turk's head knot.<\/td><\/tr><\/table>\r\n\r\nI don't know what made me think of this story yesterday.  It probably won't be a funny read, but I have nothing else to post, so what the hell.\r\n\r\nSeveral years ago, I went to sailing school with my old man and Mrs. theskinnyonbenny.  About half way through the week, we switched from a basic course to a more serious one, and we got a new instructor and a bigger boat to sail.  The new guy was kind of a hard ass.\r\n\r\nThe big boat had a wheel, and they had tied a knot to one point on the arc of the wheel.  The instructor told us that the Turk's head indicated the point on the wheel where the rudder was lined up straight.\r\n\r\nI offered, \"A <i>Turk's head!<\/i>  That's not very politically correct.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, that's what the knot is called,\" was my very serious reply.  There was no hint of amusement there.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe only guy in our class was a 60-ish pilot named Chuck.  Chuck was a boxer-shorts kind of guy, which I know because when he would take the wheel, the lay of his shorts would give the seated passengers a view right on up to his saggy old-man balls.  \r\n\r\nI wondered if I was the only one who noticed.  One night, I threw out a casual,  \"Ol' Chuck ought to consider briefs while sailing.\"\r\n\r\n\"YES HE SHOULD!\" replied my dad and the Mrs., in unison."

		"post_content" : "I really wish someone would run a weekend marathon of old <i>That's Incredible<\/i> episodes from the 1970s.  I bet that show is so over-the-top bad, that the producers are embarrassed to have been associated with it.\r\n\r\nBut when I was in elementary school, <i>everyone<\/i> watched it every single week.  (I wonder what it's competition was.  Sure, there were just three channels, but still....)\r\n<!--more-->\r\nFor you youngsters, <i>That's Incredible<\/i> had a panel of people in front of a live audience, and they ran clips of things that were \"incredible.\"  Then, the panel would come back and make comments on how \"incredible\" the clip had been.  There was usually a segment on something supernatural, a feel good thing -- a child with no legs who could walk on his hands, for instance -- and a healthy smattering of crap.\r\n\r\nI only remember a couple of specific segments.  In one, the ghost of a dead nurse was blamed for changing all of the clocks in a particular hospital.  I don't know why she did this, but I know is scared the bejesus out of me as a little boy.\r\n\r\nThe other segment I remember was one where the producers had set up a series of races between a guy on a BMX-style bicycle and a racehorse.  There was nothing \"incredible\" about this at all.  The horse smoked the bicycle in every race but one, in which the horse got spooked and went off course.\r\n\r\nBut could a guy on a bike really keep up with a horse?  I did a little math to find out.\r\n\r\nJazil won the recent mile and a half Belmont Stakes with an official time of 2:27.86.  This works out to an average speed of 36.5 mph over that course.\r\n\r\nTom Boonen, one of the elite sprinters in professional road cycling won stage one of the Tour de Suisse last week in 3:51:14.  The course for that stage was 95.7 miles, and because Boonen won it, I can assume that it was relatively flat.  This works out to a speed of 25.0 mph over the course.\r\n\r\nI don't think there's any horse that could keep up that sort of pace for four hours.  Is there a cyclist who could average 36.5 mph for a mile and a half?  Certainly not over dirt.  But there's definitely a surface and distance where the guy on a road bike could beat a horse.\r\n\r\nJust for kicks, I worked out some other speeds.  A Kenyan named Cheriuyot won the Boston Marathon (26.2 mi) this year in a time of 2:07:14.  This works out to an average of 12.4 mph.  \r\n\r\nDo you realize how sick this pace is?  I'm in decent shape, but I would just be able to match this pace on my mountain bike.  It would be a tight race.  If I actually tried to run a marathon, I would drop dead at mile 16.  But even then, I would only be on pace to finish the race in something in the neighborhood of 6 hours.  Maybe worse.\r\n\r\n(At least in cycling, I'm only twice as slow as the elite athlete.  I'm quite sure I can finish a relatively flat 95 miles less than 8 hours.  Especially if I'm in a peloton.)\r\n\r\nLet's continue.  If you aren't in Baton Rouge, you may have missed the story that LSU wide receiver Xavier Carter ran one of the fastest 100m dashes in the world this year.  He covered the distance in 10.09 seconds, which works out to an unbelievable 22.2 mph.  With a race that short, you have to consider that they start running from a dead stop.  And watching that race, you see that there's a special burst of speed that gets let out for the last 50 meters.  I speculate that the max speed might have been up around 26-28 mph.  Ladies and gentlemen, <i>that's<\/i> incredible.  If you don't think so, go get your car up to that speed, and then open the door.  Look at the ground and see just how fast you're moving.\r\n"

And it isn't getting to my desk and dealing with whatever comes my way.  In fact, there has been a crisis each of the past few Mondays.  Perhaps I'm jaded, but the client crisis doesn't get me too worked up any more.  Sure, I'll try to address the problem right away, but it's not something I sweat.  Or dread.\r\n\r\nNo, the part I hate is the whole part about getting dressed appropriately for work.  This is especially annoying to me in the summertime.  If it was entirely up to me, I would be dressed something like a native on an island -- nothing but a loincloth of some sort -- accessorized by a big hat to keep the sun out of my face.  Loincloth and hat.  Nothing more.\r\n<!--more-->\r\nI'm able to get pretty close to this during the weekend.  For example, between when I left work Friday and got dressed this morning, I had on shoes for about 5 hours (a longish bike ride, a movie, and a quick trip through the grocery store).  I wore a shirt for maybe 10 or 12.  But at least my legs were free the entire time.\r\n\r\nThis morning, I picked a pair of nice slacks.  Cotton, but thick.  And starched.  Let me just tell you that pulling those up over my ass was torture to me.  It really was.\r\n\r\nWhen I pulled into the parking lot at work, I pulled on socks and shoes, which made me feel even more hot and constricted.  I feel tight and constricted.  I know, I have problems.  Perhaps I need some anti-anxiety drugs to help me get dressed on Mondays.\r\n\r\n(At least I don't have to put down a long sleeved shirt or a tie or jacket.  When I first started my current job, I had to wear a tie every day, and I'm not a computer geek to the level that would allow one to wear a tie with a short-sleeved shirt.  Top that off with wool pants and wing tips.  Yikes.  I would barely dress that nice for a wedding in this day and age.)\r\n\r\nCompounding the discomfort, it is officially \"Mexico hot,\" now.  Just last week, the weather turned from a normal hot, to a boiling, steaming, melting agony that can barely be tolerated.  \r\n\r\nAt least in long pants.\r\n"

I had the whole hotel room to myself.  I could rub one off anywhere I wanted.)\r\n\r\nAnyway, I laughed to myself about this for a good two days.  Ever since then, I've made a note of the euphemisms for masturbation as I've used them, recalled them, or heard them used.  Here are the others that made list.\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><b>Choke the chicken, spanking the monkey, beating ones meat<\/b>  Animal abuse is a common theme.  I list these because they're so prevalent, and to encourage you to drop them.  They aren't funny.  To be honest, they never really were, but they're especially not-funny now that they get constant use.<\/li>\r\n\r\n<li><b>Wanking<\/b>  This import from Britain seems to be skyrocketing in use by us Yanks.  I'm not sure why, but it is an unobjectionable way to say it.  <\/li>\r\n\r\n<li><b>Feed the ducks<\/b>  I remember my buddy Perv using this expression once about a million years ago.  I didn't get it, until he had me visualize male masturbation while standing up.  Pretty much the same motion as feeding ducks.  Don't you agree><\/li>\r\n\r\n<li><b>Getting the last pickle out of the jar<\/b>  This one is for the ladies.  I don't think any additional elaboration is necessary.<\/li>\r\n\r\n<li><b>Cheating on your other hand<\/b>  I can't remember who I know that says this.  But I know I hear it said every once in a while.<\/li>\r\n\r\n<li><b>Having a staff meeting<\/b>  I just saw that used recently on someone else's blog.  I think it's hilarious, and hope to remember it at during an appropriate conversation one day.<\/li>\r\n\r\n<li><b>Dropping the kids off at the pool<\/b>  Those who drop real kids off at real swimming pools this summer will now flinch as they drive off every morning.<\/li>\r\n\r\n<li><b>Badgering the witness<\/b>  This one is clever.  I laughed.<\/li>\r\n\r\n<li><b>Checking for squirrels<\/b>  Another one for the ladies.  Crude enough that you would prefer to stifle that involuntary laughter.<\/li>\r\n\r\n<li><b>Jerkin one's gherkin<\/b>  A cousin of mine told some story to the rest of us (this was when we were all kids), about some old geezer who was quoted as saying, \"Boys, now don't go around jerkin' your gherkin'.\"  I don't know if the story is true, but the rhyme is nice, and the visual that it gives is pretty accurate, assuming you know the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.webster.com\/cgi-bin\/dictionary?va=gherkin\" target=\"_blank\">definition of gherkin<\/a>.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\nI figured that there were web sites dedicated to the topic of \"other phrases for masturbation,\" and of course there are.  The funniest ones I saw were <a href=\"http:\/\/www.worldwidewank.com\/funniest.html\" target=\"_blank\">here<\/a>, but even that page has a lot of clunkers.  It turns out that quantity does not correspond to \"more funny\" when it comes to this topic.\r\n\r\nThere were two definitions on <a href=\"http:\/\/www.urbandictionary.com\" target=\"_blank\">urbandictionary.com<\/a> that warrant a mention.  The definitions provided are theirs.\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><b>California Style<\/b>  A strange form of masturbation where (if right handed) you lift your right leg up and put your right arm underneath your right leg. You then proceed to whack off with your arm underneath your leg. To be done correctly, the inside of your elbow should be rubbing against the bottom of your thigh.<\/li>\r\n\r\n<li><b>The Danger Stranger<\/b>  This is an intense form of masturbation. Combining the popular stranger method with the less-known danger method. You sit on your hand until it falls asleep. You then proceed to start whacking off so it feels like someone else is doing it, and about halfway through, you yell out for your mom very loud so that she hears you. This is what makes it dangerous, you have to finish the job before she makes it to your room to see you doing your business. Be very careful, for as exciting as this may sound, it has gotten many a young man in a lot of trouble.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\nCalifornia Style?  You must be kidding me.  Please, please, please send me an email if you are a California Style enthusiast.\r\n\r\nNow, aren't you glad I don't have any pictures on this post?\r\n"

It came in a little tube with a plunger, which I use to force a jet stream of medicine to the back of her throat.  Lili had no idea that a dose of medicine was coming, and thought I brought her some little plastic toy to chew up.  She happily took it deep-throat, and when I hit that plunger, she jumped straight up, and looked at me pissed off.  Then, she ran to Mrs. theskinnyonbenny and asked for protection from the more evil human.  But hey, it's her own fault.  If she would keep the cat's mite-infested head out of her mouth, she wouldn't have had to be medicated.  <br \/><br \/>Fortunately for her, the only medicine in her future is a dose of the neck stuff that prevents fleas and heart worms (but apparently lets ear mites party unabated).<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><img src=\"\/img\/blossomthumbnail.jpg\" \/><\/td><td>Blossom handled the ear-mite plunger like a champ.  She's so naturally hungry and dopey that I'm not positive that she knows I even did anything.  We topped that off with some ear-cleaner, which allowed me to wipe out an impressive amount of dark brown goo, not unlike <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Vegimite\" target=\"_blank\">vegimite<\/a>.  That was followed by some drops to get the yeast infection out of the ears.  It seems that yeast cells are fixing up the vegimite.<br \/><br \/>Blossom gets to have the ears done every morning and evening for the next two weeks, followed by another plunger full of ear-mite poison.  And a dose of anti-flea and heartworm next week.  And oh yeah, in another couple of months, the good doctor will slice open her belly and remove her reproductive organs.  Good times for a dog.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><img src=\"\/img\/bubblesthumbnail.jpg\" \/><\/td><td>Bubbles' name doesn't do justice to what a fighter she is.  This is a scrappy little bitch, and I'm not exaggerating about that one bit.  She just finished a month-long regimen of twice-a-day milky white medicine to get rid of an infection she had that made her generate snot like a sickly toddler.  And then, the patron saint of pet disease (see below) brings that infection right back into the house.  So, we're going to take the medicine twice a day for another month.  I will be scratched to hell by Friday.<br \/><br \/>To go with that, she had to take an ear-mite plunger full of liquid, had a flea and heartworm dose due, and also has to face the music when it comes to getting spayed.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><img src=\"\/img\/nigelIIthumbnail.jpg\" \/><\/td><td>Nigel II showed up last week, with the ear-mites in tow.  He also carries the respiratory infection that makes him the only cat that I've ever seen blow snot bubbles.  Unfortunately, he makes snot out of his eyes too.  He usually feels to bad to run and play, so he gets two doses a day of the milky stuff, plus the biggest dose of ear mite plunger liquid.<br \/><br \/>  Once he regains his strength, he has three rounds of shots to look forward to, followed by the amputation of his balls.  On the up side, while you're at work all day, he's lying in a cold, air conditioned room, sunk down in the soft pillows and blankets, fast asleep.  Wouldn't you make that trade?<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/div>\r\n<div>\r\nIn other animal news, someone around here other than me finally listened to the guidance from the spirit of my <a href=\"http:\/\/theskinnyonbenny.com\/blog2\/archives\/99\">fat little Daisy.<\/a>\r\n\r\nYou see, since Lili showed up a little more than a year ago, I could hear Daisy's spirit having absolute conniption fits at Lili's behavior.  Things like, \"CHRIST ALMIGHTY!  DON'T GO NEAR THAT CAT!  YOU DON'T KNOW THAT CAT.  IT'S GOING TO SCRATCH THE SHIT OUT OF YOU!!  OH LORD, I CAN'T LOOK.  I CAN'T LOOK.\"\r\n\r\nOr, \"FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, YOUR HUMAN IS RIGHT THERE ON THE FLOOR, NOT PAYING ATTENTION TO YOU.  HUMP HIM!  HUMP HIM!  HUMP HIM!\"\r\n\r\nOr (and this one's in a whisper instead of a shout, so you really have to listen), \"Hey, the humans are just sitting there watching TV.  You oughtta sneak into the bedroom and piss on the floor.  C'mon, it'll be hilarious.\"\r\n\r\nBut Lili just wasn't from the school of Daisy.  In fact, when she first chose to play, ignoring a full bowl of dog food, she got permanently expelled from the school of Daisy.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Daisy has a true disciple in Blossom.  Having been here only five or six weeks -- and having only a handful of nights where we actually cooked from which to learn -- Blossom has figured out the trick of standing on the dishwasher door to hurriedly scour the plates and bottom of the dishwasher for bits of human food.  And she would never, ever, ever choose play over eating.\r\n\r\nNow she just needs to work up a healthy fear of cats, and get that yeast out of her ears.<\/div>\r\n"

Let's not pretend that Major League Baseball is interesting.  (At least not the games.  The steroid controversies are a little interesting.)  I have yet to cut the sleeves off of a collared shirt, and therefore don't have that part of my brain that would also allow me to follow NASCAR.\r\n<!--more-->\r\nGolf is good to put on the TV when you're ready for a nap, and need some birds chirping and soft voices to put you over the edge.  Tennis is okay, but I can't really see myself going to work and saying, \"Hey guys, did you see Nicolas Massu beat Max Mirny in straight sets yesterday?\"\r\n\r\nAnd it isn't just sports.  Summer movies are crowded, noisy, and usually fail to live up to their hype.

May was fantastic.  I bet I watched 30 hours a week of TV.  I had to stay up late and work weekends to keep up with the DVR'd shows from while I had been watching other shows.\r\n\r\nThere's plenty of daylight, but the summer heat has started, so I'm not too keen on outside activities during the afternoon.  A bike ride is nice in the morning, I suppose, but I've been to lazy to get up and go.  Too bad I don't have a boat this summer.  Being out on the water sure would be nice.\r\n\r\nSo, hopefully, life will drum up some excitement.  Otherwise, the only thing I have to post about is all of that TV that I watched during May, and about how the cat won't quit hitting keys as I try to type these posts.

		"post_content" : "If you know me -- either in real life or just through reading here -- you have probably inferred that I'm not a very political person.  You would be right.  It's not that I'm uninterested; I find aspects of politics fascinating.  The thing is that I don't care.  It's just entertainment to me.\r\n\r\nI find that I can't bear any politician who is making decisions from day to day.  I didn't care for Clinton while he was in office, and the current president makes me long for a return of the dysfunctional Clinton administration.  I guess it just boils down to the fact that I hate politicians.\r\n<!--more-->\r\nBut like I said, I am interested in the entertainment value of a political debate.  So I recently did a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.technorati.com\/search\" target=\"_blank\">Technorati search<\/a> on the phrases \"Dick Chaney\" and \"LSU\" to read up on the local argument about whether he should or shouldn't have been invited to speak at this year's commencement.\r\n\r\nApparently, I'm not the only one who is non-political around here.  the only result in a 40-million page search was <a href=\"http:\/\/blog.myspace.com\/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendID=20797959&blogID=123794326\" target=\"_blank\">one guy's myspace entry<\/a>, which pretty much just says that he's part of that whole graduation ceremony.  I'm still baffled.  There's not <i>one single blogger<\/i> out there who wants to criticize or defend LSU for having Chaney as a speaker?  That's unbelievable.\r\n\r\nIt's become clear to me that I should run the country, no matter how difficult it will be to run for president with old pictures of me flexing my muscles in Kathy Michael's panties floating around.  So here's a quick and dirty idea about my platform:\r\n\r\n<ul><li><b>Dick Chaney<\/b>:  Go ahead and euthanize the old bastard.  Actually, why not eliminate the vice president position altogether?  Their only job is to break ties in the Senate and step in when the president croaks.  How about we just say that Senate motions need a 51-49 majority in order to pass, and that Secretary of State steps in when the president gets killed.\r\n\r\nSo there.  Including travel, staff, office expenses, etc. I've just saved the government a couple million dollars a year.<\/li>\r\n\r\n<li><b>Immigration<\/b>:  Look, we're pretty much all here because our grandparents or their grandparents flocked in when the going got bad in their own countries.  And believe it or not, they lived in neighborhoods where few people spoke English.  And we all turned out okay, didn't we?  (Actually, we turned into a bunch of fat shits, come to think of it.)\r\n\r\nOkay, I concede that we probably don't need millions of illegals coming in each year.  So make sure people have the chance to come in legally when the going gets bad in their country.  Immigrants are being hired on construction crews and to clean hotel rooms anyway.  You might as well make it worthwhile to do legally, so you can collect taxes from them.\r\n\r\nYou obviously don't vote for some sort of immigrant amnesty when you don't have a clue how many people you're talking about.  But that's just the sort of thing our government would do.  And then do you think they would reduce the staff of people who are supposed to track and monitor immigration?  What a laugh.\r\n\r\nAnd if you really want to keep the Mexican border closed, then stop putting them on a bus back across, and start shooting.<\/li>\r\n\r\n<li><b>Ga$oline<\/b>:  Sure, it's expensive, but until you quit paying over $5\/gallon of bottled water (do the math), I don't really care.  If we can dig up crude oil from underneath Saudi Arabia, ship it here, refine it into gasoline, distribute it to stations nationwide, and mark up the price by 40% for taxes, and it <i>still<\/i> costs well less than the most abundant liquid on the planet, then what problem, exactly, are we trying to solve?\r\n\r\nHere's the real story:  gas has been so cheap for so long that everyone in the country bought an SUV.  Demand went up.  Prices went up.  Now, they'll start trading SUVs for cars.  Demand will go down.  Prices will follow.\r\n\r\nIf you're bitter about Exxon-Mobil paying the equivalent of 20 average Powerball jackpots last year, buy some shares, go to the meeting, and raise bloody hell.  I think it would be fun if people did that sort of thing at stockholder meetings from time to time.<\/li><\/ul>\r\n\r\nI'm not up for solving the whole Iraq fiasco for you this morning.  Maybe I'll come back to politics in a couple of years.  Until then, &lt;yawn&gt;.\r\n\r\n"

When we discovered this at my office, it was very difficult to get work done for a couple of days, but good lord did we laugh at those monkeys.\r\n\r\nStill, I have the occasional monkey pop up in my email.  I've had monkeys claiming to be Chuck Norris, Johnny Cash, and Fat Bastard from the Austin Powers movies.  But most often, the monkey claims to be someone higher up the corporate ladder at Equifax.  And most often of all, the monkey claims to be CEO Rick Smith.  They mostly sound like <a href=\"http:\/\/www.careerbuilder.com\/monk-e-mail\/?mid=5439343\" target=\"_blank\">this one<\/a>, with a general pattern of \"Good morning and welcome,\" followed by something that Rick might actually say, followed by some sort of insult or asinine comment.  I realize that I'm a child, but it keeps being funny.\r\n<!--more-->\r\nSo when Rick addressed the audience at the users' conference in Las Vegas, I had a bit of hope that he would start with \"Good Morning and Welcome,\" and a little part of me fantasized that he might even mispronounce his company as \"Eequifax,\" like the monkeys do.\r\n\r\nAlas, he failed to provide me fodder for any inside jokes.  His presentation was pretty normal CEO stuff:  strategy, performance, optimism, etc.  This kicked off Monday of last week, and the day turned into a blur of presentations and informal meetings with clients over and over and over.\r\n\r\nI should mention that the walk from the hotel rooms at the MGM out to the conference center is nothing less than daunting.  I'm not exaggerating when I say that had the conference been back in New Orleans, the equivalent walk would allow me to get from one side of the French Quarter to the other.  It was no less than 20 minutes, and could easily take a half hour, if you stopped for a distraction.\r\n\r\nThis is no good, as I arrived in town nursing a broken toe.  A couple of weeks earlier, I had spotted Lily tossing Bubbles -- the new kitten -- up in the air like one of her plush toys.  When I got up to whip her ass, she took off running.  Of course, being young, quick, and having four legs, she's a lot faster than I am.  But I was pretty close, and knew that the dog door would slow her down a step.  I thought I could get there in time to grab her by the tail, drag her into the house, and give her her deserved spanking.\r\n\r\nBut sprinting through the bedroom, I kicked some piece of furniture, causing a pain so intense that I saw colored spots.  I'm no stranger to the stubbed toe, as I regularly turn at least a couple of digits into bloody messes each year, and have lost a toenail a time or two, but this was much different and worse, although marginally nicer to look at.\r\n\r\nSo the walk to the conference center was daunting.\r\n\r\n<table cellpadding=\"2\" align=\"right\"><tr><td width=\"5\" rowspan=\"2\"><spacer type=\"block\" width=\"5\" height=\"1\"><\/spacer><\/td><td width=\"250\" ><img src=\"\/img\/ben_wiped.jpg\"\/><\/td><\/tr><tr><td class=\"caption\" width=\"250\">After the end of sessions on Monday<\/td><\/tr><\/table>\r\n\r\nI hadn't been out late the night before, but I was exhausted by the time of the vendor reception at 4:30.  I had one drink, and sampled the (not very good) selection of breaded and fried food.  And then I got out of there.\r\n\r\nAfter a very quick nap, I got talked into a late dinner and a couple of bar stops with a couple of co-workers and some clients from Boston.  But Tuesday was the day where I really had things to do for the conference, so I was in bed by 12:30 for the second night in a row.\r\n\r\nThe turnout for the first session on Tuesday morning was a little lighter, but there were still a lot of people.  The speaker was the publisher of <i>Forbes<\/i> magazine -- not Steve Forbes, but his employee who actually runs the magazine from day to day.  He's not a name that you've heard of, but he was very interesting.\r\n\r\nMy co-worker Alan hadn't made it down yet when this session started.  And unbeknownst to me, when I had gone to the room the night before, he called several of our co-workers claiming to have gotten in a bar fight and been put in jail.  It was all bullshit, but with Alan, you can't exactly rule it out altogether.  On top of that, his performance was apparently pretty convincing.\r\n\r\nSo while the Forbes guy was speaking, Alan's and my common boss sat down next to me and in a quick, worried whisper said, \"Have you seen Alan since last night?\"\r\n\r\nIt wasn't too long after that first session on Tuesday that I had my most horrifying experience of the trip.  It was about thirty minutes before an interface meeting where I was involved.  I took a restroom break, to have a -- well a \"number two\" is the nice way to put it.  Excuse me for being crude; it's important to the story.\r\n\r\n<table cellpadding=\"2\" align=\"left\"><tr><td width=\"5\" rowspan=\"2\"><spacer type=\"block\" width=\"5\" height=\"1\"><\/spacer><\/td><td width=\"250\" ><img src=\"\/img\/ben_vegaspants.jpg\"\/><\/td><\/tr><tr><td class=\"caption\" width=\"250\">The back of my pants on Tuesday<\/td><\/tr><\/table>\r\n\r\nWhen I pulled up my pants, the back part of my right leg was soaked.\r\n\r\nI about had a little panic attack right there.  There was no way I had time to make the forty-minute round trip to my room to change pants.  And even if I did, I would have had to iron the new pair.  I walked quickly out of the bathroom, talking to myself.  \"It's only water, it's only a leaky toilet bowl, it's just water.\"\r\n\r\nI decided to step outside and let the dry hot air dry off the pants.  I was trying to walk in a way so that the wet part wouldn't brush the skin of my leg.\r\n\r\nYou have to understand too that I was looking pretty darned sharp that day.  Unlike my regular day to day look, I had on stylish clothes that fit right -- including a bitchin' sport coat.  I was cleanly shaved, and had even showered.  In my hurry to get near the door, I passed Charles and Holly, who said, \"Whoh, look at you,\" and \"I've never seen you look that good in all the years I've worked with you.\"  So apparently, the look on my face when I want to puke is appealing.\r\n\r\nAs I stood outside in the sun, drying my pants, I began to calm down.  They started to dry fast, and after all, there was really nothing else I could do about it.\r\n\r\nI've told this story to several people, and there is one detail that I haven't been able to bring myself to say out loud.  When the wet spot was getting close to being dry, I sat down on a bench and pulled my leg up to my face.  I twisted the fabric around to put the almost-dry spot up to my nose.\r\n\r\nIt was piss.\r\n\r\nSo I spent the rest of my day conducting meetings and giving a presentation to a large audience with someone else's dried piss on the back of my pants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The week was scheduled where Sunday evening through mid-day Wednesday, I was there as a representative of a vendor hosting a conference.  There was some time for fun, but not a whole lot.  From mid-day Wednesday through the next weekend, I was there just for my own recreation.\r\n\r\nYou will be as surprised as I was to find out that the stories worth telling were from the work trip.  With only the rare exception, my vacation days can be described succinctly:  gamble a little, eat a good meal, drink too much, sleep it off.  It's not that there weren't good stories from these days.  I'm sure there were.  It's just that I was relaxed and having fun rather than making mental notes about the amusing things happening around me.  The best way for me to tell that story is through <a onclick=\"window.open('\/pg3.php?spgmGal=48%20-%20Las%20Vegas%20-%20May%202006','48LasVegasMay2006','width=625, height=768, toolbar=no, location = no, directories=no, menubar=no, resizable=yes, scrollbars=no');\" >this collection of photos<\/a>.\r\n<!--more-->\r\nStories of this trip will probably drag out a little bit.  I would prefer to put up one mile-long post, but I'm super busy this week, so I'll just post what I can as I can.  I might even mix in other posts before I finish all of the Vegas stories.  \r\n\r\nThe flight from Baton Rouge to Las Vegas connected through Dallas, and was populated by roughly 15 of my coworkers.  Someone, of course, made the obligatory comment about the state of the company should the plane go down, and I pointed out that the group of us didn't really do all that much work anyway, and that perhaps the company would be a little better off.  I didn't get much of a laugh at that.  The truth hurts.\r\n\r\n<table cellpadding=\"2\" align=\"right\"><tr><td width=\"5\" rowspan=\"2\"><spacer type=\"block\" width=\"5\" height=\"1\"><\/spacer><\/td><td width=\"250\" ><img src=\"\/img\/atairport.jpg\"\/><\/td><\/tr><tr><td class=\"caption\" width=\"250\">This wasn't everyone on the flight, but a good contingency of the Equifax people getting ready to board the plane.<\/td><\/tr><\/table>\r\n\r\nThe plane from Baton Rouge to Dallas was one of those tiny little tubes, much smaller than a bus.  I had the first row -- with bulkhead legroom, and the only empty seat on the flight right next to me.  As I was settling in to zone out with a magazine, Steve Uffman -- the Kingpin Honcho of our division -- walked in at the last minute, paused at my row, and said, \"I got your email, let's talk about that when we get a chance.\"\r\n\r\nBeing in my weekend mentality, I could only just barely fathom what he meant by the term \"email.\"  And once I grasped that difficult concept, I realized that I hadn't sent him any email.  So my face was clearly confused.  He gave me a quick out.  \"We'll talk about it later.\"\r\n\r\nWhen he walked off, Lon turned across the 8-inch wide aisle and gave me a heads-up about what he meant.  It was a client problem that I had warned that he should be briefed on.  Once I was told, it was obvious what he meant.  But for some reason, I had failed to see the question coming, and looked like a fool.\r\n\r\nThis is reminiscent of last year's client conference, where a reception was held at the Audubon Zoo in New Orleans.  As one bus was about to leave in order to return to the hotel, Steve got on board.  I was seated next to a co-worker named Holly, who was the only one on the bus who was three sheets to the wind.\r\n\r\nShe decided to play cheerleader, and tried to get everyone in the vicinity to yell, \"HOORAY FOR STEVE\" on her three count.\r\n\r\nYou can see where this is going.\r\n\r\nOn the count of three, she let out a loud \"HOORAY FOR STEVE\" all by herself.  Then, she got mad at everyone and tried to rally their support for a repeat performance.\r\n\r\nOnce again, a single shout of \"HOORAY FOR STEVE\" rang through the bus.\r\n\r\nAfter about three rounds of this cheer, she realized that she was doomed to perform by herself, and put a lid on it for the rest of the bus ride.\r\n\r\nSteve had the class to ignore the commotion altogether.\r\n\r\n<table cellpadding=\"2\" align=\"right\"><tr><td width=\"5\" rowspan=\"2\"><spacer type=\"block\" width=\"5\" height=\"1\"><\/spacer><\/td><td width=\"250\" ><img src=\"\/img\/limo.jpg\"\/><\/td><\/tr><tr><td class=\"caption\" width=\"250\">Getting ready to ride out to the hotel.<\/td><\/tr><\/table>\r\n\r\nI had a chance to get back into my game on the way from Dallas to Vegas, as Steve was seated directly across from me, and I had a chance to answer his questions.  Once we arrived, I saw him go to one of the limo for hire guys, and made sure to stick behind him, so I could save myself the expense of a cab ride to the MGM.\r\n\r\nAnd then the conference began.\r\n"

The worst part is the suddenness of when they begin.  There's a bright flash of emergency light, and then before your mind has time to process the question, \"Am I having a seizure?\" the first horn of alarm goes on.  And off.  And on.  And off.

There's no consistency.  We might go a couple of months without the alarm, and then it might go off two days in a week.  Or three times in one day.  I wish I was exaggerating.  The end result is that there's rarely an orderly evacuation when the alarm goes off any more.  If it doesn't stop after several minutes, people will gradually filter out of the building as their tolerance for the noise dissipates.

I have been advised that the alarms in this area will NOT affect the Solo Building or the Equifax \/ Convergys \/ OPH Building.  However, when activated, the alarms will audibilize in the Concourse (old and new) and in all tenant spaces which connect \/ open directly into the Concourse.  The alarms will be activated three times, each lasting between 15 - 30 seconds.  During this time, please disregard the alarms you may hear. \r\n\r\n2. On Thursday, May 4, from 900am - 1000am, the State Fire Marshal will be testing our fire alarms in the same area.  The same areas will be affected in the same manner as the day before.  Please disregard the alarms you may hear during this time, as well.\r\n\r\nWe hope this advance notice helps ease the pain of the intrusion of the alarms, but know that we are very sensitive to minimizing their interference to your operations and we truly appreciate your companyâ€™s patience.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you have any questions about this matter.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\nNorm {lastname}\r\n\r\nFacility Manager,\r\nBon Carre' Business Center\r\n<\/blockquote>\r\n\r\nTo which I replied,\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n\r\nTell olâ€™ Norman that we're pretty damn sure that the fire alarms work just fine back here.\r\n\r\n<\/blockquote>\r\n\r\nAll I can say is that I hope ol' Norman has a good sense of humor, because Vicky gave it a chuckle, and forwarded my message to him.  And copied me.  He didn't bother to reply.\r\n\r\nAnd I haven't really gotten my due enjoyment out of the new South Parking lot, and I didn't even know about the new West restrooms.

This was probably somewhere around 6-8 years ago, but I think anyone who was there will confirm that it was a mighty powerful throwdown.\r\n<!--more-->\r\nWe come back from the conference every year with stories about co-workers.  There's no way I'm going to start writing them down, but you might be surprised to know that I usually have the sense at these things to not be among the very drunkest ones around.  There's only so much room in people's memories for stories, and you can get pretty wild and still not make the cut.  That's my strategy.\r\n\r\nBefore someone throws this into the comments, I'll confess that I showed my wiener on Bourbon Street for $20 bucks one time.  But I have a small  wiener, and I'm not exaggerating to say that absolutely no one noticed at all.\r\n\r\nI can only think of one other thing that I did which was bad enough that people remembered the next day.  It was a good number of years ago too, so I won't mention it, in hopes that it's forgotten by now.\r\n\r\nAnyway, the House of Blues thing featured copious amounts of alcohol.  At the time, it was the most alcohol ever consumed at a private party at the House of Blues in New Orleans.  Also, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.marvawright.com\/\r\n\" target=\"_blank\">Marva Wright<\/a>, who was great.\r\n\r\nThe highlight of her performance was when she decided to pick on Craig, who was the president of the company.  Craig was an uptight guy in those days (and perhaps he still is).  He was uptight at work, and seemed to get even more stressed in crowds of heavily-drinking employees and customers.  He usually made himself scarce pretty early in the party.\r\n\r\nBut Marva caught him before he left, and came up with the lyric, \"Craig ain't got no drawers on.\"  Just so you can imagine it correctly in your mind, she pronounces \"drawers\" as \"draws\" and \"on\" as \"own.\"  She got the band playing a quick beat and chanted it over and over.  I know it's hard to picture the sound:\r\n\r\n\"Craig ain't' got no draws own, Craig ain't' got no draws own, Craig ain't' got no drawuhs own .\"\r\n\r\nCraig was completely unable to appreciate some fun at his expense.  I didn't see him myself, but the story is that he got flustered and high-tailed it.\r\n\r\nThe correct move, should you ever find yourself in Craig's situation, is to make your way to the stage, climb up with Marva, and drop your pants.  This might prove Marva right or might prove her wrong, but either way, you become the hero rather than the butt of the joke.\r\n\r\nThere are a couple of reasons that this story has come up in conversation lately.  First is that this year's conference is next week.  For the first time, it is being taken out of New Orleans to Las Vegas this year.\r\n\r\nThis is the point where I should complain about taking all of the tourise money that the conference brings in out of our local city, just at the time when they are recovering, and need our conference most.  It really is a shame.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I start to get itchy when it's been a year since I was last in Las Vegas.  I try to go every 8-12 months, just to make sure I don't get to that point.  I had reservations last August, just as the hurricane came in and closed the airport, and my method of departure with it.  So I'm about 4 months past my one-year since Vegas maximum, and I'm overwhelmingly pleased that my airfare is taken care of.\r\n\r\nThere are several things that should conspire to keep this year's group pretty tame.  First, the distance between here and Vegas is going to keep most of the young, wild set at home.  It's mostly management types -- and our management types are probably younger and wilder than at most companies -- but they aren't the ones about whom you tell stories for years to come.\r\n\r\nLas Vegas isn't New Orleans.  They are my two favorite places on Earth to go out, but they are very different.  Vegas doesn't have a row of bars on the strip like New Orleans bars:  places where you can walk in, drink from a dirty test tube, and listen to a live band for free.  And then the exact same type of pace with a different band next door.  No, the bars are separated by thousands of yards of casinos.  You won't be wandering from one to another looking for an impromptu group of comrades.  That will take a lot of wind out of the sails.\r\n\r\nMost of the party-hard bars in the casinos are the high energy, loud music from a DJ type of place, and they usually have relatively steep cover charges.  They also sometimes have lines to get in.  \r\n\r\nAnother problem is that the gambling is a distraction from the drinking.  Yes, it's free at the tables, but you can't put 50 people at the same blackjack table.\r\n\r\nFinally, there are just too many other things to do in Vegas.  After a day of sessions in New Orleans, you can eat great food and get a drink.  That's pretty much it.  But if you're a novice to Vegas, you're going to want to see the pretend pirates fight at Treasure Island, the white tigers at Mirage, the water-light-music thing in front of Bellagio, etc.\r\n\r\nThe work conference ends on Wednesday, at which time Mrs. theskinnyonbenny and a group of buddies show up to close out the week with me.  I should have plenty of stories and pictures to post from this trip.\r\n\r\nThe other thing that has reminded us of Marva Wright is that she's playing a free outside concert in Baton Rouge after work on Friday, May 19.  I checked her web site, and I see that the \"ain't' got no draws own\" song is standard fare, so naturally, I'm very much looking forward to this show.  \r\n\r\nI'll make sure to take a picture or two at this show also. If I'm really feeling industrious, I'll even try to record a snippet of my favorite song to post for you."

		"post_content" : "It was recently brought to my attention that I have a reputation among the neighbors as a peeping Tom, and I know exactly how that reputation originated.\r\n<!--more-->\r\nTwo summers ago, I was doing the finish work on the Regal Beagle, the grill\/bar area in our back yard.  It was August, and scorching, searing hot outside.\r\n\r\nI was up on a ladder, installing some lighting.  The location of the light's junction box necessitated a particular location and angle for the ladder.  It happened to give me a view into the neighbor's back yard, and that view happened to show me nothing but their hot tub.\r\n\r\nA new couple had just rented the house.  I had seen them in and out for a couple of days, and I might haven even told them hello.  Of course you see where this is going.\r\n\r\nThey came out of the house, clad in swimsuits, and got in the hot tub.  I think they're crazy to want to baste in chlorine water when it already feels like a hundred degrees, but whatever.  I tried to keep my eyes on my task.\r\n\r\nBy and by, they started making out.  Then, I glanced over and noticed that the suits were lying on the side.  And then... almost... yes... BINGO!  We have intercourse!\r\n\r\nSo that's when I officially became a voyeur.\r\n\r\nBut before you get titillated, let me describe what I could see.  A giant, hairy, man back and butt.  It sloshed around as if it were a dead sea creature getting rocked by small tidal waves.  There was no sign of the female underneath.  In fact, if I didn't know better, I would actually think that he as trying to make a meal of her.  I don't mean that in a nasty way.  I mean that he looked like a lion gorging on an antelope.  A hairy, fat, sweaty lion.\r\n\r\n(If this story sounds familiar to you, I actually wrote a post about it right after the event.  My provider had some sort of technical problem, and this particular story didn't make it through the recovery.  Either that or big hairy neighbor knows good hackers.)\r\n\r\nThere is no chance that they saw me, or that they know that I had to witness this.  I didn't mention it immediately.  Mrs. theskinnyonbenny showed up with lunch as I was finishing up, and there we sat, just across the fence and some bushes, eating our sandwiches, while they squirmed around in the hot cesspool.\r\n\r\nIt turned out that the man wasn't around much.  Rumor has it that he had a wife somewhere else, and just hopped into Baton Rouge for a quick poke now and then.\r\n\r\nThe chick spent a year or so in the house.  I saw her leave to go work out once or twice, but she didn't get out much.  There was clearly no job, and no hobbies were evident.  She did like to go out in the back yard after midnight, sit alone, and play Coldplay albums really loud.  Sometimes she would be in the hot tub, sometimes just in a chair.\r\n\r\nWhen she would do this, I would go into our bathroom and turn on a light.  Our bathroom light is the only one she could see from that back yard.  I counted on the assumption that she was stupid, and that she would think I could see her better with the light on rather than in the dark.  (Of course, with the light on at night, I could see only my own reflection.  I just wanted her to know I was there.)\r\n\r\nI think my bathroom light episodes were the ones that started the neighborhood tongues wagging about me being a peeping Tom.  As if I would want to watch her sit in a chair and listen to Coldplay.  I just wanted to get some shuteye.\r\n\r\nShe's long gone, and there are now two new guys living in the house next door.  Nice guys.  Louie set out to make nice with all of his new neighbors, and has filled the previously unoccupied role of telling us what all of the other neighbors say about us.  Thus, the new knowledge of being a suspected pervert.  God only knows what he tells the neighbors what we say about them.\r\n\r\nYesterday after work, I dragged the trash to the Curb for Tuesday morning pickup.  As I turned to go back in, I saw a mist coming from the front of their house.  I walked slowly back, trying to stay discretely behind a car and the shrubs.  When I got right up to my front door, I could see the whole picture:  Louie was sitting on his front stoop, smoking a cigarette.  Somehow, he had started a little brush fire in the dry leaves in his flower bed.  He was blowing on it in a futile attempt to put out the fire.\r\n\r\nI got Mrs. theskinnyonbenny to go spy on him out of the window, to make sure the fire went out without incident."

My school library had a series of books on these topics, and I went through them one after another.\r\n\r\nBy far, my favorite topic was Bigfoot.  I went on to read other books that I could find.  Of course, this was before Al Gore invented the Internet, so library books were about my only option.  I knew about all of the highly-publicized sightings, and I had seen pictures of that grainy video that the Bigfoot nuts still site to this day.\r\n<!--more-->\r\nIt was several years ago that a co-worker of mine clued me in to the fact that the (mainly UFO) cooks had their own radio public forum, and that it was broadcast all over the country, if only you have the tolerance for sleep deprivation to get up and listen to them.\r\n\r\n<table cellpadding=\"2\" align=\"right\"><tr><td width=\"5\" rowspan=\"2\"><spacer type=\"block\" width=\"5\" height=\"1\"><\/spacer><\/td><td width=\"250\" ><img src=\"\/img\/bigfoot.jpg\"\/><\/td><\/tr><tr><td class=\"caption\" width=\"250\">Bigfoot, from the famous Patterson Video<\/td><\/tr><\/table>\r\n\r\nWhen I first started listening, it was always hosted by a guy named Art Bell.  Art's dementia (presumably -- I don't actually do any research before writing these posts) sent him into a state of semi-retirement, and the show is usually hosted by another man, whose name I don't know.  Back in Art's day, it was such a low-budget production that they encouraged callers to dial the phone number and let the line ring and ring and ring, so that they wouldn't have phone company charges for time spent on hold.\r\n\r\nOne morning earlier this week, I left for work a bit before 5:00 AM.  I tuned to the local talk radio station, knowing that the UFO nuts would still be calling into the middle-of-the-night show.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that the topic that morning was Bigfoot.\r\n\r\nThe \"expert\" talking to the host was tracking an individual Bigfoot.  (Apparently there are also families of them -- a fact that I've either forgotten, or a fact that wasn't known during my 70's era research.)  To be honest, he wasn't very interesting, and I didn't learn anything new.  But he did get me thinking about my elementary school interest.\r\n\r\nI googled \"Bigfoot grainy video\" (okay, maybe I do about 30 seconds of research per post), and I found that the old footage that I remembered is known as the \"Patterson video\" and that the Bigfoot enthusiasts are known as \"cryptozoologits.\"  And there are a bunch of these nuts out there.  Perhaps I'll start reading up on Bigfoot again.\r\n\r\nI put a self-imposed end to my young fanaticism after a nightmare, which I can still picture.  I was playing alone in my home's finished basement when I looked up and saw Bigfoot staring at me through the little window at the top of the basement wall.  When he saw me notice him, he punched through the glass to try to get in after me.  I started running up the basement stairs, waking up before making it to the top.\r\n\r\nScary shit."

		"post_content" : "I think I mentioned once that Auburn fans think that the LSU fans smell like corn dogs.  I had heard this through word of mouth, and then at the Auburn game last year, I actually heard an Auburn guy walking around LSU's campus say, \"It sure does smell like corn dogs around here.\"\r\n\r\nI never saw anything written before this week, when someone sent me the text from <a href=\"http:\/\/mb8.theinsiders.com\/fauburnfrm13.showMessage?topicID=8.topic\">this message board post<\/a>.  I'm not sure if this is what started the whole corn dog think, or if it was the most eloquent culmination of the rumor.  The post is dated from 2003, so I doubt it's going anywhere.  But just in case it does, here is what it says.  Sorry that it makes this post overly long, but it's worth the read.  \r\n<!--more-->\r\n<blockquote>LSU fans smell just like corn dogs.\r\n\r\nYes, it is often said, but so, so true. \r\n\r\nLSU fans do smell like corn dogs.\r\n\r\nI would never tell them that to their face though. This is something better said at internet distances. Even now, I am afraid.\r\n\r\nI am afraid that they'll know I said it. I'll walk past an LSU fan someday, and he'll see that look in my eye that gives it away. That look that says, \"gee, what is that smell? Is it corn dogs?\" The next thing you know, I'll have flat tires on my car.\r\n\r\nIf you only learn one thing from me today, remember not to tell LSU fans how they smell - you know, like corn dogs.\r\n\r\nLSU fans seem, somehow, sensitive to that whole corn dog issue.\r\n\r\nI think this may be why a lot of fans get beaten up by LSU fans. If you attend a game in Baton Rouge, try to avoid telling them that they smell like corn dogs. Say something else instead. Like, \"Wow, LSU sure does have a great team this year. This is going to be a great SEC game.\"\r\n\r\nIt's hard. I know. It's like when you're having sex and you try to think about baseball. That corn dog smell is just so overwhelming. It makes it hard for you to think about football or baseball or whatever else. Your brain wanders into corn dog topics like: \"Gee, I wonder if I took a bite of your finger, if you would taste just like a corn dog?\"; or \"Is this a real person or is it a giant corn dog trying to make me think it is a real person?\" or \"What did that giant corn dog just say?\" or \"Excuse me, Mister, why is it that you smell just exactly like corn dogs smell?\" or, of course, after a silencer: \"Madam, did you just let the corn dogs out?\"\r\n\r\nHeck, after what I've heard about LSU fans, I think it may be better not to smell them at all. Okay, not all of them. Some of them are nice. Sure. Smell the nice ones. That's okay.\r\n\r\nYou know what else is a bad thing to do? Holding your nose around them. They are real sensitive to that, too. Try holding your breath. But don't be obvious about it. Somehow they know you're trying not to breathe in the corn dog smell. And that offends them. They'll likely punch you for that if they catch on to what you're doing. \r\n\r\nIf you do breathe it in long enough, though, it'll permeate your whole body, and then you'll smell like a corn dog just like they do. But don't say, \"Dang, now I smell like a corn dog.\" They take offense to that. And they will throw things. But not corn dogs. Hard stuff. Stuff that leaves bruises and makes you bleed. Then you may have to get stitches or something. Just don't say it. If you do start smelling like a corn dog, just shut up about it. Okay?\r\n\r\nI think kids are acutely aware of corn dog smells too. Counsel your kids on how to behave around LSU fans. If LSU fans are driving around town, do not let your kids stick their heads out of your car window and sniff the air. No. Keep your windows rolled up. An odd change in their expression - indicating they smell corn dogs - might get a wrench or pipe or some other object tossed at your windshield. So, that's dangerous. Let your kids stick their heads out of the car windows as you drive - on some other weekend.\r\n\r\nI know you are just as puzzled as I am about some of this corn dog stuff. What puzzles me most is that I've never actually seen any of these LSU fans with a corn dog in their hand. Okay, maybe there's no mystery there - maybe they already ate the corn dogs. Who knows? Maybe there's a corn dog factory in Baton Rouge and they all work there. Maybe, there's a corn dog lotion that they wear, or a French perfume. Maybe their city council puts corn dog juice in the water supply - kind of like fluoride. The politics there are probably weird. The big political issue during the city election is whether they should add more ketchup or more mustard to the water. Don't comment on it though. It's not politically correct over there. It's like a malnutrition issue or something. It's like the corn dogs are probably added to the water to prevent starvation or something.\r\n\r\nI know when you go to Baton Rouge, you're thinking: \"Ahhhh. Here I am in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. I'll bet the people here smell just like boiled crawfish or shrimp etoufe' [sic] or some fancy Cajun food.\" But just stop thinking that. That's just a myth. They smell just like corn dogs.\r\n\r\nIn fact, please listen to my advice. Leave them alone about the corn dog odor. And don't try masking the odor with something stronger. They'll curse at you. They'll say something like: \"WTF, how dare you smoke a cigar in my home.\" or \"WTF!! Are you too good for the smell of corn dogs?\" and they'll cuss out your kids too: \"WTF!!! Little Mister fancy pants over here acts like he doesn't want to smell like corn dogs.\" \r\n\r\nCajuns are not like us. Don't you see that, yet? They are really sensitive about being sniffed and about their corn dog aroma. They know they smell like corn dogs and it is no laughing matter to them at all. I know. I know. We sniff the bammers and the UGA dawgs and the Ole messes, and we keep a straight face with each of them, but don't press your luck with the Cajun tiger fans. Don't refer to Death Valley as corn dog valley either. I mean that's just wrong. Even if you've been drinking, they'll beat you up and curse out your kids.\r\n\r\nAlong these lines, be extra careful when you laugh in their direction - even if you're laughing about something else. Like baseball or football, or sex or whatever. If you can't control yourself and you must laugh though, do not snort. The snorting makes them think that you smell their corn dog body odor from a distance or that you're choking on it or something. They'll likely burn your van for that. We lost a campus building over just one snort. \r\n\r\nSo, just remember. You can love one another without sniffing each other. You can enjoy the clash of a couple of good football teams. You can enjoy the thrill of the rivalry. But after the game, please heed my words. Please just move along. No sniffing the opposing fans this Saturday. Okay? Get your corn dog jollies at home. \r\n\r\nEnough with this corn dog talk. Let's play ball...\r\n<\/blockquote>\r\n\r\nI kind of like the whole running theme about being afraid of the violent LSU fan, and I kind of dislike it at the same time.  But the fact that I smell like a corn dog to Auburn fans isn't even the point of this post.  I have a couple of corn dog stories that are worth telling on their own merit.\r\n\r\n<center><img src=\"\/img\/greenline.gif\" \/><\/center>\r\n\r\n<table cellpadding=\"2\" align=\"right\"><tr><td width=\"5\" rowspan=\"2\"><spacer type=\"block\" width=\"5\" height=\"1\"><\/spacer><\/td><td width=\"250\" ><img src=\"\/img\/corndog.jpg\"\/><\/td><\/tr><\/table>\r\n\r\nThis story probably won't seem funny when you read it, but it certainly was to me at the time.\r\n\r\nAmber went out to lunch one day.  She came back to her desk and spread out a corn dog to eat.  It wouldn't have been that funny except that it was such a production.  She had a piece of paper under it, and the cardboard sleeve over that, and the corn dog and mustard arranged just so.  It probably wasn't actually there, but I picture a fork on the left and a knife on the right as well as a cloth napkin in her lap.\r\n\r\nI hadn't seen a corn dog in years and years, and I wasn't the only one who found the scene to be hilarious.  The corn dog's appearance was so random and surprising that we continued to talk about the whole thing for a couple of months.  Amber took corn dog related abuse until it stopped being funny any more.  And with this childish group, that was a long time.\r\n\r\n<center><img src=\"\/img\/greenline.gif\" \/><\/center>\r\n\r\nI have a better corn dog story than that from back in college.  But I have to introduce a few characters that you don't yet know.\r\n\r\nThis was from when I lived in a fraternity house at LSU.  We had lunch there every day, cooked by an obese black lady known only as \"Mama D.\"  I have no idea if she had any other name.  Her cooking was mostly horrible, and mostly soul food.  It always -- and I mean absolutely always, without exception -- caused me serious heart burn.  But when something was good, she got all of the credit.\r\n\r\nThe menu was prepared and food ordered by the house mother, Miss Mary.  Miss Mary was elderly, and a bit off her rocker.  She was usually intoxicated by dinner time.  When the food was bad, Miss Mary always took the blame.\r\n\r\nMost of the guys who would be eating lunch around us were just (what I would consider) normal college guys.  Often, lunch would be the first time some of them would emerge from their hangover sleep.  I knew a lot of guys who never seemed to have class in the morning.\r\n\r\nThere was one guy at lunch during this incident who was short and thin.  He was kind of a dark and hairy kid, and when he came out of the closet a year or two later, no one was all that surprised.  This guy's name was Steven, and you have to picture him as a small weenie type of guy.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time, we would have corn dogs for lunch.  These corn dogs were the most horrible tasting things that anyone's ever tried to pass off as food.  The meat parts had to have been the pigs' guts and hoofs, the corn meal was bland and tasteless and too mushy.  They were truly God-awful.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the first person would see that it was corn-dog day, the incessant bitching would begin.  Sometimes, I could laugh at just how bad they were, but most of the time, I was hungry.  I needed something edible.  Just writing about it is starting to piss me off again, all these years later.\r\n\r\n(deep breaths....)\r\n\r\nOkay, back to my story.\r\n\r\nOne day, we were sitting at the table, watching Price Is Right, and trying to swallow as many corn dogs as the palette could stand.  Miss Mary was out there eating her lunch out there too, and the conversation went something like this...\r\n\r\nEddie:  \"Man, these corn dogs sure do suck.\"\r\n\r\nBen (watching TV):  \"NO! What are you thinking ?!  Klondike bars are always $1.99!  What an idiot!\"\r\n\r\nSomeone else:  \"Man, my stomach doesn't feel so good.\"\r\n\r\nSuddenly and loudly, Steven interrupted the inane small talk.  He held his fork right up into Miss Mary's face and said in his gay little voice, \"MISS MARY, IF YOU SERVE US CORN DOGS ONE MORE TIME, I'M GONNA STICK THIS FORK IN YOUR EYE!\"\r\n\r\nMiss Mary, either unconcerned, drunk, or both just smiled her crazy little grin.\r\n\r\nA couple of us started laughing immediately, but most people just kept eating their corn dogs.  Just another day eating Mama D's cooking.\r\n"

The makings of a boring post?  Perhaps, but there were a few things worth sharing.\r\n\r\nDuring our meetings, I had some mental down-time, while the bankers discussed (in excruciating detail) some aspect or other of the new system that they were implementing.  For example, there was about a thirty minute debate on the definition of a branch to them.  So I had an opportunity to stretch my brain and write limericks about the trip, which I will use to punctuate this post.\r\n<!--more-->\r\n<table><tr><td>\r\n\r\n<table cellpadding=\"2\" align=\"right\"><tr><td width=\"5\" rowspan=\"2\"><spacer type=\"block\" width=\"5\" height=\"1\"><\/spacer><\/td><td width=\"250\" ><img src=\"\/img\/ben-rcadome.jpg\"\/><\/td><\/tr><tr><td class=\"caption\" width=\"250\">Ben in front of the RCA Dome a couple of hours before game time.<\/td><\/tr><\/table>\r\n\r\nFirst and foremost, if it weren't for the fact that I was traveling with Tyler, I would have been <i>totally<\/i> unprepared for the weather.  I honestly didn't occur to me that April could still be winter in some places.  We had been in the 80s pretty consistently, and I had talked the week before to someone in Cincinnati (pretty much in Indiana, more or less), who was excited about temperatures in the 70s.  Therefore, my bag had clothes to wear to meetings, plus short sleeve shirts and shorts.\r\n\r\nAt work Monday morning, Tyler said something like, \"You know that it's going to be freezing there, right?\"  And was he ever right.  We walked around downtown on Monday night, which coincided with the NCAA basketball championship game.  It was cloudy and gray.  The temperatures were probably in the low 40s, but it felt a lot worse than that, and the wind blew like a sonofabitch.  I was in a sweatshirt, jeans, and jacket and still freezing my tail off.\r\n\r\nWe set up in the Champps sports bar right below where the ESPN pre-game broadcast was taking place:<\/td><\/tr>\r\n\r\n<tr><td><table cellpadding=\"2\" align=\"center\"><tr><td width=\"5\" rowspan=\"2\"><spacer type=\"block\" width=\"5\" height=\"1\"><\/spacer><\/td><td width=\"250\" ><img src=\"\/img\/indychammps.jpg\"\/><\/td><\/tr><tr><td class=\"caption\" width=\"250\">The building with the purple light is visible in this blurry photo on both the ESPN broadcast and out of the window.<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/td><\/tr>\r\n\r\n<tr><td>The place was packed with people, all of whom had some affiliation with one of the four Final Four teams.  I realized too late that my blue cap made me appear to be a UCLA fan, and I had nothing to indicate that I was a Tiger.  I'm sure this cost me an enjoyable bullshit session or two with like minded fans.\r\n\r\nThe Indiana locals were mostly unattractive, which I mention only to bring me to my first limerick.<\/td><\/tr>\r\n\r\n<tr><td class=\"caption\"><center><br \/><br \/>Hoosiersâ€™ diets include much corn\r\nBut they do not produce much porn\r\nBecause the women get fat\r\nWho wants to see that?\r\n(This limerick will buy me much scorn)<\/center><\/td><\/tr>\r\n\r\n<tr><td>The bar pretty much cleared out by game time.  We started watching the game, without a whole lot of interest.  What became more interesting was the lack of good dish washing at the place.\r\n\r\nThe bar back would dunk beer mugs into one tub of water, and then into another.  Presumably, the first one included some sort of cleanser, but there was no effort to actually \"wash\" anything.  It was just two dunks, and then back into the cooler.\r\n\r\nYou know the nice frosty coating on your mug at Champps?  Rinse water.  Nothing more.\r\n\r\nThe most egregious offense was when he was putting a wine glass back into one of those things where the glass hangs upside down.  The rinse water was dripping down, so he puckered his lips, and blew all of the excess water away.<\/td><\/tr>\r\n\r\n<tr><td class=\"caption\"><center><br \/><br \/>At Champps dishes do not get washed\r\nAnd germs never ever get quashed\r\nThe man with the trash\r\nPuts hands in the bath\r\nAnd spreads filth through the water with a slosh<\/center><\/td><\/tr>\r\n\r\n<tr><td>Appetites quashed, we left during the first half, and walked up to the ESPN set to lookey-loo.  Surprisingly, the set was just sitting there empty, and we were able to wander around without anyone saying anything about it.  We didn't actually go sit at the desk or anything, but I did steal a copy of their plan for the pre game.

There are nine pages in all, but they're all pretty much like this souvenir.\r\n\r\nThat night, Tyler woke up and spent a good bit of time puking.

But I did write three more limericks that were related to the meetings.

		"post_content" : "I have a little bit of news about things that happened over the weekend, but first, I have an entertainment note.\r\n\r\nI noticed a trend in television this week that I doubt any others will point out.  In the course of <i>one<\/i> week, I have witnessed no less than three realistic-looking vomitings on scripted television shows.  I can't remember which show started the trend (<i>Lost<\/i> maybe?), but it was followed by last week's episode of <i>Huff<\/i>, and then capped by a multiple Tony Soprano puking last night.\r\n<!--more-->\r\nI know all of these episodes were filmed months ago, so they aren't copying each other.  My theory is that someone in Hollywood came up with a device that allows the simulation of a very realistic looking puke, and successfully pitched it to a lot of TV execs.  I don't really watch too many shows in a week, so if I extrapolate, I have to believe there were more than a dozen characters blowing chunks on TV last week.\r\n\r\nBack to my weekend.\r\n\r\nMrs. theskinnyonbenny and I dragged my family to the Ponchatoula Strawberry Festival this weekend.  It's one of those big festivals in Louisiana that you always hear about, and the weather was perfect on Saturday.  Unfortunately, that didn't translate into a time that I would recommend.\r\n\r\nMy main complaint is about the music.  There were three stages, and during the daytime portion of Saturday, I saw the following acts:\r\n\r\n<ul><li>A chick on the smallest state, singing Karaoke style (that is, to a recording, with no band) bad country music.<\/li>\r\n\r\n<li>On the biggest stage, an auction, where people payed around $150 for a flat of strawberries to support various charities.  By contrast, we paid $16 for a flat that supports no one but the strawberry growers and sellers.<\/li>\r\n\r\n<li>We finally saw a band with instruments setting up on the third stage.  We walked over there just in time to see a Jon Benet Ramsey looking little girl belt out loud, bad country music songs.  As this was our best choice, I actually stayed there and hated life through the entire set.<\/li>\r\n\r\n<li>Walking away for a porta-potty break, I noticed a band on the auction stage playing -- you guessed it -- country music.  Shit, organizers, get it together.  If you have three stages, consider that someone might want to hear something -- anything else.<\/li><\/ul>\r\n\r\nThe good included a booth that sold strawberries that were deep fried.  I also ate a couple of pretty good meat pies, which were free of strawberries, and had a strawberry daiquiri with an undetectable amount of alcohol.  (Hmmm, this paragraph was supposed to list the good things, wasn't it?)  I was too full for a strawberry sundae, but there was one calling to me.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday, I did a little bit of cleanup in the yard, then went for a bike ride.  It honestly might have been the best weather day in the entire history of South Louisiana.  I won't go on, but it was unbelievable.\r\n\r\nWhen I got back from the ride, we had gotten a new kitten.  Our neighbor found a couple of strays somewhere.  He offered us one and kept the other.  Then, to top it off, we got a new puppy yesterday evening.  So, there are a lot of noisy, whiny animals around here this morning.\r\n\r\n<table cellpadding=\"2\" align=\"right\"><tr><td width=\"5\" rowspan=\"2\"><spacer type=\"block\" width=\"5\" height=\"1\"><\/spacer><\/td><td width=\"250\" ><img src=\"http:\/\/theskinnyonbenny.com\/img\/gal\/49%20-%20New%20Animals%20-%20Spring%202006\/data\/normal.jpg\"\/ width=\"250\"\/><\/td><\/tr><tr><td class=\"caption\" width=\"250\">The new dog, who has no name yet.<\/td><\/tr><\/table>\r\n\r\nLast night after dinner, we were sitting in front of the TV (between puke scenes) with some strawberry short cake.  The puppy and kitten were becoming acquainted with each other on the couch with Mrs. theskinnyonbenny.  There was a distraction, and the puppy somehow ended up with a nose full of Cool Whip, some of which she transferred to the cat's eyebrow.\r\n\r\nNow, the scene of the puppy and kitten sitting side by side, oblivious to the fact that they are wearing whipped cream on their nose and eyebrow was probably the cutest damned scene that's ever existed on this planet.  Unfortunately for posterity, I was too busy feeding my face to get up and take a picture.  But the fact that I considered putting down my food to get the camera gives you some indication of how postcard-worthy the scene was.  You can see the pictures that I did take <a onclick=\"window.open('\/pg2.php?spgmGal=49%20-%20New%20Animals%20-%20Spring%202006','49NewAnimalsSpring2006','width=625, height=768, toolbar=no, location = no, directories=no, menubar=no, resizable=yes, scrollbars=no');\"  >here<\/a>.\r\n\r\nI can't tell if the little cat is a boy or girl, because he\/she freaks the f--k out when I try to flip him\/her over.  I should be scratched to shreds by the end of this week, unless I give up, and just name it something gender neutral."

		"post_content" : "Over the few years I've been doing these posts, I imagine that I've told a number of stories where the principal theme is some boneheaded thing that I did, which lead to odd consequences.  This one should top all of the rest of these.  \r\n\r\nOn Saturday night, we had a group of people come over to eat and watch the NCAA semifinals.  Even though the LSU game was late, we got a relaxed, early start.  Eddie brought over a couple of sacks of crawfish, and Shelly brought the stuff to fry onions and pickles.  We had beer galore.\r\n<!--more-->\r\nThe burner that I have has a propane tank, connected to two burners, with each burner having its own valve.  It lets you run both at once, with varying degrees of flame.  I started boiling the water for the crawfish, as it takes a while for a big tub of salty water to get boiling.\r\n\r\nWe fried a couple of batches of onions.  One came out good, one slimy due to too-cold grease.  We vowed not to ruin another batch and turned up the fire under the grease.\r\n\r\nAbout that time, the crawfish water started to boil.  To make it easy on ourselves, we poured both sacks of mudbugs into the one basket.  The basket weighed a ton, but the two of us lifted it up, and lowered it into the boiling water.  At the time, I wondered how we would possilby lift the boiled ones out of the water, but I just took another swallow of beer, to give me strength.  I also put a batch of batter-covered mushrooms in the fryer.\r\n\r\nWe started to lower the hot basket of crawfish into the water, and as suspected, it weighed about a million pounds.  We lifted the basket several inches above the crawfish pot, and some water splashed into the hot grease on the burner next door.  This causes a little flame to shoot up, but it immediately went out.  \r\n\r\nI shoved the arm of a little wooden paddle through the handle of the basket in order to help lift out the basket.  We both pushed up on each side of the paddle, which made it a lot easier to lift.  As we lowered the crawfish into the boiling water, I heard a cracking noise.\r\n\r\nThe next few paragraphs might take you a minute or two to read, but everything here happened within a second or two.\r\n\r\nThe paddle snapped in two, dropping the crawfish basket back into the pot of water.  This sent a huge wave of boiling water into the scorching grease next door.  The next thing I remember, I was looking into a huge wall of flame.  It was way over my head, as I couldn't see the top or sides of the flame.\r\n\r\nI really got scared when I turned my back to the flame, and I was still looking at fire.  Instinct told me to run, and I was clear of the flames by the time my mind told me, \"Fuck, you're in the middle of the fire.\"\r\n\r\nYou know how when you get hurt really badly, you don't feel the pain when it happens, and it just starts to hurt as you get clear of the immediate danger?  I was fine until I was out, and then the left side of my face and next started to burn.\r\n\r\nI looked up, and saw the faces of my friends near by.  Absolute terror.  I asked, \"Am I still on fire?\"  Someone said that I wasn't.  I put my hand to my burning face, and was immensely relieved to feel flesh and lack of blood.\r\n\r\nMrs. theskinnyonbenny shouted, \"YOU ALMOST BURNED DOWN OUR HOUSE!!!!\"  She claims that the fire ball was up to the roof line.  I was still freaked out, and gave a panicky response that I don't remember, but was vaguely centered on my own well-being.  I remember that even to my own ears, I sounded slightly insane, and I think there was an f-bomb in the response.  \r\n\r\nI turned and looked back where the fire ball had been.  No kids and no pets were in the area.  Nothing was still on fire.  No one was injured.  Don't they say, \"God looks after those with heads up their ass?\"  I don't think that's the exact expression, but there is some saying where that's the jist.\r\n\r\nAbout that time, Eddie poked his head (and just his head) from around the side of the house.  His eyes were as big and round as if there were golf balls glued to his head.  It was clear that he didn't know whether to expect a normal back yard, or whether to expect to see Beirut.\r\n\r\nThe stinging on my neck and face disappeared pretty quickly.  But my nerves were shot.  I put on my game face, but I had a pretty healthy case of the shakes, even as I finished the crawfish, and finished the frying -- after the boiling water had been safely removed.\r\n\r\nSo, to recap, here are the things I won't be doing any more:\r\n\r\n<ol><li>Cook near the house.<\/li><li>Boil right next to the fryer.<\/li><li>Overload the crawfish basket.<\/li><li>Try to lift heavy basket with a wooden handle.<\/li><\/ol>\r\n\r\nBy the way, I have another recent experience with passing unharmed through a large section of flame, which I haven't yet shared on this site.  I will -- but I haven't gotten around to it yet.\r\n\r\nBased on these two experiences, I am not yet ready to concede that I am without superpowers.\r\n\r\n"

		"post_content" : "I haven't updated my site too much lately, and there are a lot of reasons for that.  First off, I've been busy at work, and there are three things that make it hard for me to post about my work life:  <ol><li>The risk of giving away some supposedly confidential information, and thus terminating my employment<\/li><li>The even risk of causing my employers grief and embarrassment, and thus terminating my employment.  To that end, I am refraining from posting a recent picture where I took the stock photo of new (and bald) Equifax CEO Rick Smith and gave him a full head of hair, a big porn mustache, and a hairy bare chest.  I'm sure it's spot-on how he looked in the mid 70s.<\/li><li>The fact is, that most of the geek stuff I do at work is pretty boring.<\/li><\/ol>\r\n<!--more-->\r\nThe second reason that I haven't done much posting is that I've been pretty darned busy away from the office too.  Of course, there's basketball.  When both of your school's teams are making a run to their final fours, there's a huge demand on you for hoops viewing. I end up watching every game, as if my scouting the other teams can help LSU in some sort of way.  I could go on and on, but other than yesterday's short little post, I've written about nothing but basketball in a couple of weeks.  I'm afraid I'll start getting the comments like, \"who the f--- are you, and what makes you such a basketball expert?\"  And we know that I don't want to have to come down on some fool about the extent of my expertise.\r\n\r\nAlso on the home front is a project that I just finished to put new floors and baseboards upstairs.  It's pretty much done now, but I spent most evenings up there last week, and then finished the paint yesterday.\r\n\r\nThe last distraction that I'll report is that I got a new video ipod, and a cooler gadget is yet to be invented.  So that demanded that I rip videos to mp4, and update my itunes library (now venturing into geek speak...).  Now I just have to find that video of the puppet dog making fun of the Star Wars nerds, so I can watch it whenever I want.  \r\n\r\nAnyway, since I really have nothing to say, I'll share a quick email exchange that I recently enjoyed:\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\nFrom: Clarence Darrow [sue_you_bigtime@yahoo.com]\r\nSent: Tuesday, February 28, 2006 1:49 AM\r\nTo: Ben Schultz\r\nSubject: Libelous statements\r\n\r\nDear Mr. TheSkinnyOnBenny,\r\n\r\nIF that is your REAL name!\r\nThis is to notify you that our law firm has been retained by a person in your city who claims that you have libeled him on your alleged web site.  According to our client, you have besmirched his good name, have held him up to the ridicule of his peers, and have damaged his reputation with local employers.\r\nMy client insists that you remove all references to him on your web site, derogatory or otherwise, and that you desist from any such statements, written or oral, in the future.  Should you refuse to do so, you will be served with the appropriate papers and the matter will be brought before a civil court as our client has instructed my firm.  He will seek damages in the high 6 or 7 figures.\r\nAnd, though I have not mentioned my client's name, I believe you know full well of whom I speak.  However, just to insure that there is no misunderstanding, I will inform you that our client, the fine young man whose boots you are not worthy of licking and who may never fully recover from the psychological abuse and ridicule to which you have subjected him is that paragon of civility and exemplar of kindness ... none other than Mr. Tyler Cummings!\r\nI await your, no doubt, inadequate response.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\nClarence Darrow, Esq.\r\n<\/blockquote>\r\n\r\nIn case you were put off and just skimmed the message, or in case you just don't read very well, here are the things that were especially funny:  <ul><li>writer bothered to create email address of <a href=\"mailto:sue_you_bigtime@yahoo.com\">sue_you_bigtime@yahoo.com<\/a><\/li><li>\"IF that is your REAL name!\"<\/li><li>\"the fine young man whose boots you are not worthy of licking\"<\/li><\/ul>\r\n\r\nI think there was a follow up note after I didn't respond to this one, but I don't see where I saved it.  I guess it wasn't as brilliantly written.  Anyway, when I finally responded, it went like this...\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n\r\nFrom: Your Fired [sueyoubigtime @gmail.com] \r\nDate: Mar 8, 2006 4:16 PM\r\nSubject: Re: Libelous statements\r\nTo: Your Fired [sueyoubigtime @gmail.com]\r\n\r\n\r\nMy Dear Mr. Darrow,\r\n     \r\nPlease be advised that Mr. theskinnyonbenny has retained my services, in order to respond to your most preposterous and ludicrous claims sent by email in recent weeks.  The content which you describe is indeed far from being deleterious, detrimental, disadvantageous, evil, harmful, injurious, nocent, nocuous, or even prejudicial.  The content regarding Mr. Cummings on theskinnyonbenny.com is in fact what has propelled Mr. Cummings into a state of celebrity, and is among the main reasons that he hold his current position as a pillar in our society.  Many of his interviews in the press, and his recent appearance on \"Live with Regis and Kelly\" can be traced back to the free advertising that he receives from this site.\r\n     \r\nWe will thank you now to renounce your silly little campaign against Mr. theskinnyonbenny.  You will no doubt be awed by his ability to secure such impressive legal council, and discontinue your action post haste.\r\n\r\nWe retain the opportunity to counter-sue, for the damage and lost revenue that your actions are costing Mr. theskinnyonbenny.\r\n\r\nOr to put it another way,\r\n\r\nIf the web-site don't malign,\r\nYour ass will be mine!\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJohnny Cochran\r\n<\/blockquote>\r\n\r\n...to which I received this response...\r\n\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\nFrom: Clarence Darrow [sue_you_bigtime @yahoo.com]\r\nDate: Mar 11, 2006 9:02 PM\r\nSubject: Re: Libelous statements\r\nTo: Your Fired [sueyoubigtime @gmail.com]\r\n\r\nDear Mr. Cochran,\r\n\r\nMy Fired what?\r\n\r\nOh, you must have meant \"You're\" instead of \"Your\", but that inattention to detail is precisely why I shall prevail in this little legal matter.\r\n\r\nI will not bother to point out the outrageous inaccuracies in your note as you know very well what they are.  However, the fact remains that I doubt very much if you have any grounds to counter-sue \"for the damage and lost revenue that your actions are costing Mr. theskinnyonbenny.\"  It is a well known fact that theskinnyonbenny.com is a money losing proposition and, in fact, is on the verge of bankruptcy.  In support of that claim, I offer evidence that Mr. theskinnyonbenny often shaves his head in order to sell his hair for extra income in the attempt to keep the site afloat.\r\n\r\nBe that as it may, despite whatever my client, Mr. Cummings, may have been saying at work, he has directed me to press forward in his demand to have any reference to him or his works removed from your client's web site.  The poor lad is on the verge of an emotional breakdown over this continued harrassment.\r\n\r\nPressing matters prevent me from continuing this particular email, but I do feel it incumbent upon me to point out, Mr. Cochran, that you are legally dead and, therefore, are unable to initiate a legal action of any sort.\r\n\r\nWhile it must be admitted that I, Clarence Darrow, am also legally dead, I died first, so I can claim the right of Primus Mortificus Judiciare and conduct all current legal affairs with the able assistence of the disembodied spirit of Spencer Tracy or his estate's attorneys.  I believe that Mr. theskinnyonbenny may be familiar with Mr. Tracy's spirit, as he has glimpsed his youthful apparition on the second floor of a house near to his own on more than one occassion.\r\n\r\nProceed at your own peril, Mr. Cochran.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\nClarence Darrow, Esq. (deceased)\r\n<\/blockquote>\r\n\r\nAhh yes, there's a grammatical error in the name.  Any reader of this page should be less than surprised. Here's an offer that stands for any of you:  find three more writing errors on the current page, print them out, and mail them to me.  Include a $3.50 handling fee, and I'll send you a free box of Girl Scout Cookies!\r\n\r\nUm, I also feel compelled to point out the misspelled words \"harassment, assistence, and occassion, which I would have never noticed without a spellcheck."

		"post_content" : "I'm sure that there's an age when a man's body and mind go through a change, and that change causes the first thought in the morning to be about the need to urinate, rather than \"I'm horny.\"  I don't know when that happens, but I'll let you know when I get there.\r\n\r\nI mention this, because I had an unusual first thought this morning.  \"What a basketball game.\"  In case you missed it, or if you're looking back at this post from years in the future, last night LSU's basketball team beat top seeded Duke to move on to the Elite Eight.\r\n<!--more-->\r\nI don't think I complained here about Tennessee getting a 2 seed in the tournament.  LSU won the conference outright, and we beat them outright during the regular season.  Also, LSU went to the semifinals of the conference tournament.  I don't remember when Tennessee got eliminated, but it was much earlier.  ESPN was with Tennessee during the days before the selection, and the coach and team talked about hoping for a 4 seed over a five.  How they got a 2 is anyone's guess, but it was good to see them lose to Wichita State in the second round.\r\n\r\nLSU looked like an extremely good team last night.  Duke Senior J. J. Redick might have been removed from the \"player of the year\" debate, as he was held to 2-11 shooting from the field by LSU freshman Garrett Temple.  Freshman Tyrus Thomas as credited with 13 rebounds and 5 blocks, but his shot blocking threat kept all of Duke's shots tentative while he was in the game.\r\n\r\nI would have never thought that Thomas and Glen Davis could combine for 52 minutes because of foul trouble, and LSU still be in the game.\r\n\r\n(Can you tell that I've had a chance to study the box score?)\r\n\r\nBest moments from the final minute of the game:\r\n<ol><li>Tyrus Thomas dribbles the ball right past a pressing Duke defense for an uncontested tomahawk jam.<\/li><li>Seconds later, Thomas is in the paint on the other end of the floor, and swats a Duke shot right back over the head of the shooter.<\/li><li>Big Baby is at the free throw line with a handful of seconds left.  He could sink both free throws to put the game where Duke would need two scores in order to win.  He hits the first.  LSU pulls everyone off the lane and back on defense in case he misses the second.  Clank goes the ball, but the only purple shirt in the TV picture -- the shooter -- jumps between the entire Duke team to get his own rebound.<\/li><\/ol>\r\n\r\nBut my absolute favorite part of the game -- and I'm going to reveal a bit about my evil inner nature here -- was watching Redick cry at the end.  I wrote this a couple of hours before posting it, just to give myself a chance to find a picture of Redick crying.  I didn't have as much time as I would have liked to search, but I couldn't find one on the main sports sites Friday morning.  The Duke sports site didn't help me out either.  If I find one later, I'll post it somewhere around here.\r\n\r\nTwo last things to mention.  First, I saw <a href=\"http:\/\/www.apple.com\/pr\/library\/2006\/mar\/14hoops.html\" target=\"_blank\">this article<\/a> about the games from this years' tournament being available for video ipod.  I'm certainly willing to pay $2 for the ipod version of this game.  I searched the itunes store this morning, but I guess the games aren't out yet.\r\n\r\nFinally, a note of warning to anyone who happens to be with me Saturday, or in other games if LSU happens to win on Saturday.  I happened to be wearing a new pair of shamrock pajama pants during the game.  So if we're at a bar during a game during the rest of this too-short season, I'm going to look like a fool."

It's perhaps the most unimpressive day one can have when picking basketball results.\r\n\r\nAs of now, I'm firmly lodged in second-to-last place in our pool.  But, I seem to be the only one who picked Memphis to win, so if they go all the way, I can still come home with the cash.  They have some college called Bradley up in the next round, and they have looked as strong as anyone so far.  I like their odds as much as anyone else's.\r\n<!--more-->\r\nI just made the travel reservations for an upcoming work trip, and as I was doing it, I realized that I'm going to get to Indianapolis the night of the championship game.

Hopefully, the matchup would end up being LSU vs. Bradley, so ticket demand wouldn't be that great.\r\n\r\nThat won't happen, but I'll at least have a chance to drive down and witness the hoopla before the game, and maybe I'll catch it at a sports bar near the stadium.

Your browser does not support plug-ins for digital video.<\/noembed>\r\n\r\nEvery year, the NCAA basketball tournament, St. Patrick, and perfect Spring temperatures conspire to make this the best weekend of the year.  Either the basketball or the St. Patrick's day parade alone would make this a big deal for me, but the combination of the two make this bigger than Christmas, Thanksgiving, New Year's Day, or the highly overrated Fourth of July.  Heck, it might eclipse all of the fun in those days combined.\r\n\r\nYesterday was the first day of the basketball tournament, and I picked 14 of 16 games correctly.  That's without a doubt the best day that I have ever had picking games.  I mention it this morning, because there's equally as good a chance that I pick 2 of 16 correctly today.\r\n\r\nI liked <a href=\"http:\/\/today.reuters.com\/news\/newsArticle.aspx?type=topNews&storyID=2006-03-16T202709Z_01_N16357150_RTRUKOC_0_US-SECURITY-NCAA.xml&archived=False\" target=\"_blank\">this story<\/a> about a bomb sniffing dog whose attention was distracted by a hot dog cart.  I can picture exactly how this happened, as my first beagle Daisy would have handled it the exact same way, had she been trained for bomb sniffing duty.\r\n\r\nThe dog put her nose to the ground, and slowly made her way, sniff, sniff, sniff, all through the section of the arena to which she was assigned.  She smelled lots of concessions, but knew her duty was to find explosives, so she initially ignored those smells.  Only after she had made one pass through her section -- knowing good and well that there was no explosive to find -- did she decide to score some human food.\r\n\r\nAbout that time, she caught the scent of a hot dog cart, even though that cart was around a bend and invisible to the eye.  She kept her nose to the ground, and walked right up to the cart.  She pointed her face at the tub where the dogs boil, and then looked back at her human.  In her mind, it was clear that she was just asking for a hot dog.\r\n\r\nThe human, mistaking the request for an indication of explosives, called in the bomb squad.  They cleared out the arena, kept the fans back, and disassembled the cart, only to find a tub with several hundred dogs floating in hot weenie water, which then had to be thrown out.  I doubt the fat little beagle even got to eat one.\r\n\r\nNo doubt the dog will be retired from bomb duty after that lapse.  I hope he gets the chance to be adopted by a basketball fan.  If she were my dog, I would have a tradition where we share a couple of hot dogs the first day of the basketball tournament every year.\r\n\r\nBack to tomorrow, we have the parade near by, and then I've got the pots going to make pastalaya and to boil crawfish after the parade.  I've reserved a keg of green beer, and made a playlist which of course includes the song at the top of this post.  I'll be up by 5:00 AM, giddy and excited.\r\n\r\nHappy St. Patrick's Day!<\/embed>"

Before we left for work, Nigel nuzzled and licked his dog, and they curled up on the bed for a long nap while the humans were at work.  When I came home at lunch time, they were still curled together, apparently having failed to move over the course of the morning.  He was a happy cat.\r\n\r\nRest in Peace, little friend.  Until we're together again."

Just based on the location, the look of the building, and how long they took to renovate the building, I expected high prices, average food, and overworked, unattentive staff.  I guess I'm a pessimist.\r\n<!--more-->\r\nHappily, I was wrong on all of these expectations.  I've tasted about half of the menu, and everything I've had has been very good.  A couple of dishes are even better than very good.  The atmosphere is open and bright.  The barstools are made for the wide behinds typical in Louisiana, and the bartender who works Monday-Wednesday is among the best in town.\r\n\r\nTuesday night, we went by there for a drink after work.  I couldn't decide what to order, and numb-brainedly ordered a Bud Light.  As it turns out, they guy next to me at the bar was a rep from a beer distributor, and of course, Bud isn't one of his brands.\r\n\r\nTo make things even more uncomfortable for him, he was meeting a supplier, and he really wanted the people around him to be drinking the beer that these particular people supply.  So, he bought my next beer, upgrading me to a similar-tasting watered down brew that was imported and more expensive.  It's not what I would have picked had I known I was going to get a free beer, but hey, free beer of any kind tastes a lot better than beer you had to pay for.\r\n\r\nWe got to bullshitting, and the beer distributor (whose name was out Jordan something or other) turned out to be a heck of a nice guy.  I know a job's a job, but when you get to buy beer for strangers, you are going to be popular.\r\n\r\nWe ended up sitting around and shooting the breeze for several hours.  Jordan went to a table to entertain his dignitaries, but he would walk up to the bar from time to time and offer me another free beer.  Like I said, he was a good guy.\r\n\r\nOn a barely related note, I saw in last Sunday's local paper that one of the arrests was a guy for sixth offense DWI and illegal possession of Xanax.  There was no mention of driving without a license, so I'm assuming that he can legally drive as long as he's sober.\r\n\r\nI figure that to be arrested for your sixth DWI, you've been driving drunk more nights than not for several years.  Which could lead your thoughts one of two directions.\r\n\r\nThe obvious train of thought is to wonder why the guy isn't locked up with the key thrown away.  Did the Judge think that after the fourth or fifth DWI that the guy was finally serious about his rehabilitation?  If this guy kills someone's kid next time he's out driving drunk, then whoever keeps letting him drive shares some responsibility.\r\n\r\nThe other argument that you could make is that maybe he's been driving drunk for so long and so often that he really isn't all that dangerous.  You have to think that if he had killed anyone or caused any serious, major damage, he wouldn't be out on the road.  But since he hasn't, maybe he's good to pop a Xanax, wash it down with a few vodka rocks, and drive on home.  His record is pretty good.  Hundreds and hundreds of attempts driving drunk, six stops, and no one killed.  \r\n\r\nMaybe I didn't make that last argument very well.  I don't really believe it, but it's a fun point of view to consider.  Are there super drinkers out there who are fine to drive drunk? "

		"post_content" : "The biggest question that I always have while watching the Oscar broadcast is, how do they phase out celebrities that no longer make the A-list?\r\n\r\nOn Sunday, for example, there was old Jack Nicholson, sitting front and center for the whole broadcast, and then being the presenter for the Best Picture award.  Has he been an A-lister so long that he has tenure?  <!--more-->I think it's been a while since he was nominated for anything.  How does he keep his clout?\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there was no sign of Tom Hanks, other than an appearance in a video segment.  Did he choose to forgo the party?  I would think that he's just as well entrenched.  To think that Tom wasn't invited to be a presenter, but Keanu Reeves was is a bigger leap than my mind can manage.\r\n\r\nAs we would have expected, gay cowboy jokes were pretty common.  There was a video segment of old cowboy movie shots that could have been taken as gay, which was great.  It started with one cowboy looking down at another's nether regions, and asking, \"Mind if I look at your Winchester?\"  That's good comedy.\r\n\r\nI also liked the very beginning, where a camera zoomed in on the Brokeback Mountain tent, as an announcer introduced Billy Crystal as the host.  Crystal stuck his head out of one side of the tent and said, \"Um, I'm busy right now.\"  Then, the other side of the tent opened, and Chris Rock said, \"I'm busy too.\"\r\n\r\nEveryone seems to have an opinion about <i>Brokeback Mountain<\/i>, but damn near nobody has seen it.  Well, I went and watched it, and really, all of the hype is because of gay cowboys in the 70s.  Suppose you swap out gay cowboys for the same story, but make it interfaith or interracial or some other reason why society didn't want them to hook up.  What you're left with is a slow moving movie where you feel moderate pity for the characters.  It's a yawner.  But the scenery is really pretty, if that makes it worth your seven bucks.\r\n\r\nI think the real reason that people are afraid to go see it was expressed by Larry David, in <a href=\"http:\/\/select.nytimes.com\/gst\/abstract.html?res=F50917FA3B540C728CDDA80894DE404482\" target=\"_blank\">this article<\/a>.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>I just know that if I saw that movie, the voice inside my head that delights in torturing me would have a field day.  \"You like those cowboys, don't you?  They're kind of cute....  You can't fool me, gay man.  Go ahead, stop fighting it.  You're gay!  You're gay!\"  Not that there's anything wrong with it.<\/blockquote>\r\n\r\nAs you certainly know by now, <i>Crash<\/i> actually won the Best Picture award, and it was a far better movie.  It was pretty interesting, written from the template of <i>Traffic<\/i>, which was better yet.  I do like movies where a lot of stories are loosely tied together.  It makes you pay attention a little more.  In my opinion <i>Capote<\/i> might have been a little better, and <i>Munich<\/i> was definitely more exciting.  If they had lopped the first hour of <i>King Kong<\/i> down to about 10 minutes, that would have been an excellent, excellent monster movie, which is one of my favorite genres.\r\n\r\nThe only award that I thought was bad was Reese Witherspoon's Best Actress.  I haven't seen the other movies in that category, but she wasn't nearly as good in <i>Walk the Line<\/i> as she was in <i>Election<\/i>.  I figure that your Best Actress award should come from your best performance.  I don't really understand how <i>Election<\/i> didn't turn into a cult hit, along the lines of <i>Napolean Dynamite<\/i> or <i>The Big Lebowski<\/i> (where, incidentally, you can spot Best Actor Philip Seymour Hoffman in a bit role).\r\n\r\nThe \"moment to put Walt's corpse in motion\" was during the performance of \"It's Hard to be a Pimp,\" which later won the award for Best Musical something or other.  Back when I used to pimp for spare income, I always knew I should make up words about my experiences.\r\n\r\nI haven't heard much talk about Jennifer Garner nearly busting her ass as she walked to the microphone to give an award.  She had the perfect opportunity to drop a line that Electra would have said after administering an ass-kicking.  Something that only the coolest comic book nerds would have gotten, but everyone would have had to laugh and pretend that they knew what she was talking about.  But she missed her chance.\r\n\r\nI haven't really blogged about all of these movies as I've seen them, so there's one more note that I feel compelled to mention.  In <i>Good Night and Good Luck<\/i>, the amount of cigarette smoking is absolutely astounding.  It's hard to imagine that they actually smoked cigarettes on the air back then.  Every character <i>always<\/i> had a smoke going.\r\n\r\nI understand that people really smoke this much back in the 50s.  At Antione's in New Orleans, there is (or was before Katrina) a dining room with portraits of old important guys from that era.  Almost all of them are posed in their photos with a lit cigarette held thoughtfully over their breast bone.  If you picture a wall full of photographs of your grandfather and his buddies, and all of them in suits, and all of them with cigarettes, you get the picture.  "

Besides, I think the broken car is metaphorical.  As big a man as Jim Holt must surely be, a real car still wouldn't fit in the palm of his hand.\r\n\r\nI wonder if I'll need a three piece suit and a cowboy hat for when we go to negotiate with the insurance company?

I had been watching one about a bar that was haunted by a former bartender who had blown out his brains with a shotgun in the back room.  It was one of those shows where actors play the parts, and then they switch over to the actual people for little interview segments.  \r\n\r\nIt's a cheaply made program.  By showing the same acting segment several times, sandwiching commercial breaks, they end up having an hour-long show with fifteen minutes of actual acting footage.\r\n<!--more-->\r\nEven though the shows are 100 percent cheese, this one gave me a little fright at 2:00 Saturday morning.  I figured that cowardice was an indication that it was time to turn off the TV and go to bed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm happy to make fun of those shows, but at the risk of sounding like someone who should himself be ridiculed, I think there's a house in my neighborhood that's haunted.\r\n\r\nAs regular readers know, I walk the dog at night.  The people who live in this house must spend their time in the back, because the front rooms are almost always completely dark.  It never really bothered me, and it's a very average house.  I never really paid much attention to it.\r\n\r\nOne night, as I was passing, I just started to feel creeped out for no real reason.  I got something like a little chill, and started to feel nervous.  Or maybe anxious is the better word.  I looked up at the dark windows, and I could just make out a face looking back out at me.\r\n\r\nI think I shit myself a little bit, but I forced a deep breath and looked back.  I stopped and stared.  The face didn't move, and I couldn't see it very well because of the dark.  I had the sense that it was a boy's face.  It wasn't at the height that it would have been a full grown person.  As it wasn't changing, I convinced myself that I was seeing a statue or a plant with an unfortunately human sort of shape or something like that.\r\n\r\nA week or so later, I worked up the nerve to walk past again.  This time, the front rooms were alight.  I slowed way down and craned my neck to take inventory of everything in the rooms.  I didn't see anything by the window, and I didn't see anything at all that looked remotely like a child's face.  I just chalked it up to imagination.\r\n\r\nA couple of months after that, I had nearly forgotten about all of this.  Then I got another chill.\r\n\r\nI looked up at the dark house and didn't see anything.  My eyes were set on the spot where I had seen the face, and there was nothing.  But as I was moving my gaze back to the road, there was a small face in the next window over.  I glanced back once to make sure that I wasn't imagining it.\r\n\r\nI wasn't.\r\n\r\nI made haste, and got the heck out of there.\r\n\r\nSince then, I've walked past the same house dozens and dozens of times without seeing anything unusual.  From time to time, the front is lit up, and there are people living there.  Once, I passed as the people were dragging their trash to the curb.  I passed up the opportunity to ask if they sensed that their house was haunted.  I would rather think that it is.\r\n\r\n\r\n<table cellpadding=\"2\" align=\"right\"><tr><td width=\"5\" rowspan=\"2\"><spacer type=\"block\" width=\"5\" height=\"1\"><\/spacer><\/td><td width=\"250\" ><img src=\"\/img\/lunarpark.jpg\"\/><\/td><\/tr><tr><td class=\"caption\" width=\"250\">Bret Easton Ellis's <i>Lunar Park<\/i><\/td><\/tr><\/table>\r\n\r\nThat's my whole ghost story, but if you like creepy stories, I have a book recommendation for you.

		"post_content" : "Well, winter finally arrived to Baton Rouge this weekend.  By winter, I mean that on Saturday, there were only a handful of hours during the middle of the day where it was warm enough to wear shorts, and even then, only because the hatred of long pants outweighs the discomfort of cold legs in my book.\r\n<!--more-->\r\n<table><tr><td>Our coldest Saturday of the year coincided with \"bring your dog day\" at Bluebonnet Swamp.  Bluebonnet Swamp is a small swamp and wooded area smack in the middle of a busy part of town.  It's crossed with gravel trails over the dry land and boardwalks over the marsh, and at least until your cell phone stars vibrating your groin area, it quickly feels like legitimate wilderness.\r\n\r\nAs soon as it warmed up enough to be outside in shorts, I took Lili for her first trip.  It turns out that there's nothing that beagle likes more than charging down a trail in the woods.  She was so anxious to head down the trails that she declined the free treat and water that we were offered at check-in.  So, down the trail we started.\r\n\r\n<table cellpadding=\"2\" align=\"right\" style=\"float:left;\"><tr><td width=\"250\" ><img src=\"\/img\/liliSwamp.jpg\"\/><\/td><td width=\"5\" rowspan=\"2\"><spacer type=\"block\" width=\"5\" height=\"1\"><\/spacer><\/td><\/tr><tr><td class=\"caption\" width=\"250\">Lili, forced to stop her sprint through the park so that I could tie my shoe.<\/td><\/tr><\/table>\r\n\r\nAt the dog's urging, we charged up and down trails at breakneck speed, and we found that we had pretty much seen everything -- or rather, we had passed by everything -- in ten minutes.\r\n\r\nOn my previous trips to the swamp, it had been muddy.  This weekend, the swamp was a glorious, thick gray-green soup, with water in some places up to the bottom of the boardwalk.  There's also a new trail that loops around to a locked door, through which you can see the Bluebonnet library.\r\n\r\nWe made a couple of other passes around the park, sniffed a few butts, got our ears scratched by a kid, and avoided a particularly mean dog.  Then, a park official came out and asked me to kindly refrain from sniffing other patrons' butts, so we had to leave.\r\n\r\nAfter watching the end of an LSU basketball game, I took a little nap.  The house was cold, so I woke up a couple of hours later on a small couch, covered in a dog and a couple of cats.\r\n\r\nAfter my nap, I got a call from Mrs. theskinnyonbenny, requesting that I meet her and a bunch of coworkers at The Chimes East.\r\n\r\nThe Chimes East is a new restaurant and bar, and I had never as much as seen the building.  But I had assumed that I might just never go there, on account of two big strikes.\r\n\r\nFirst, it's in my \"no-go\" zone for Baton Rouge.  I've been here long enough that I know all parts of town, but with only a couple of exceptions, I have no use for anything North of Florida Blvd. or East of Airline Highway.  Sure, I occasionally go North for Tony's Seafood or a Krispy Kreme.  Or I might venture East for a movie or for....  Well shit, I don't know why, but I might go that way for something or other.\r\n<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>\r\n<table cellpadding=\"2\" align=\"right\" width=\"100%\"><tr><td><img src=\"\/img\/btrmap.JPG\"\/ width=\"685px\"\/><\/td><\/tr><tr><td class=\"caption\" >The New Official Map of Baton Rouge<\/td><\/tr><\/table>\r\n<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>\r\nMy \"go\" quadrant of town really has everything I need.  It includes LSU and downtown.  I added a little hump that allows me to get to work without leaving the \"go\" quadrant.  I've probably been to every bar and restaurant in there, most of them dozens of times.\r\n\r\nThe second and more important strike on The Chimes East is that it isn't the original Chimes.  Most of you probably know The Chimes, but if not, I'll give you the briefest of summaries.\r\n\r\nThe Chimes is a bar and restaurant at the edge of LSU's campus.  It's been where it is for I don't know how long, but it's at least been on its current corner since before I came to town in '89.  In short, it's probably one of the world's best bars.  They have hundreds of beers, and dozens on tab.  The food is top-notch and reasonably priced.  It's the type of place where you will see the heavily pierced Goth kids next to a table of sorority girls next to a table of yuppies next to a professor at the bar next to a bum next to a drunk old woman.  It's just about always crowded.  If you're looking for elbow room, convenient access, or a non-smoking section, The Chimes probably isn't your type of place.\r\n\r\nI know this is a bit of a tangent, but since this post is already ridiculously long, I'll indulge myself.  Some time ago, I wondered what toilet, outside those at my home or at work, I've used the most.  I decided on the stainless steel urinal trough in the men's room at the back, rightmost corner of The Chimes.  I conservatively estimate that I've peed there an average of four times a month every month since September, 1989.  That comes to 784 urinations into that trough.\r\n\r\nSo I was a little bit disappointed to see how nice The Chimes East turned out to be.  It's a nice two-story brick structure with lots of big windows.  Even though it's a new building, it has the feel of a renovated warehouse.  The inside is very open, and it's actually kind of pretty.\r\n\r\n<table cellpadding=\"2\" align=\"right\"><tr><td width=\"5\" rowspan=\"2\"><spacer type=\"block\" width=\"5\" height=\"1\"><\/spacer><\/td><td width=\"250\" ><img src=\"\/img\/ChimesEastToilet.jpg\"\/><\/td><\/tr><tr><td class=\"caption\" width=\"250\">The way-too-normal toilet at The Chimes East<\/td><\/tr><\/table>\r\n\r\nThe menu and beer selection was the same.  But there were some big differences:  there was plenty of on-site parking, we were seated in a non-smoking section, and twice, our waitress called me \"sir.\"  I don't think that has <i>ever<\/i> happened at the real Chimes.  I should also mention that I peed (three times) in a porcelain toilet rather than in a steel trough.\r\n\r\nOverall, it was pretty good.  I won't make the frequent drive to that part of town just to go there, but in all honesty, it probably is worth the occasional trip.<\/td><\/tr><\/table>"

Haven't -- and probably won't -- tried the other one) and Georges.  Again, the original George's seems better than the other one, but maybe it's just my appreciation for the originals.  These two places have fries where you can actually taste some potato and grease.  It's the perfect complement to cheese or chili.  \r\n\r\nYou probably know someone who knows exactly which wine would taste great with a particular fish.  I know exactly what fry grease tastes good with cheese.\r\n\r\nThose who defend the waffle fries could be brainwashed.  I compare them to those who maintain that their <a href=\"http:\/\/theskinnyonbenny.com\/blog2\/archives\/108\">knock off watch<\/a> i as good as the real thing, or that Easy Cheese from a can tastes just like cheese that actually has to be refrigerated.\r\n\r\nAnyway, it's high time that Baton Rougans start expressing a little outrage.

		"post_content" : "Last Summer, I noticed an odd new mole on my shoulder.  It was skinny, and it stuck up enough that you could wiggle it back and forth.  When Summer ended, I started wearing a shirt more often, and since it was at the base of my neck where I couldn't see, I forgot all about it.  Heck, it might have gone away altogether.\r\n\r\nLast week, in this same spot, I noticed my mole again.  It had gotten sore and turned red.  This was a bit worrisome, so I made an appointment with a dermatologist to get it checked removed.\r\n<!--more-->\r\nBut while I waited the few days for my appointment, my body took care of itself.  Saturday morning, I was bored, and I wiggled it around a little just to pass the time.  It was harder than before, and gave me more wiggle room.  Nervous about this change, I went to check it out in the mirror.\r\n\r\nIt had turned into a scab and was to the point of almost falling off.  I gave it a sort of vigorous rub with a flat hand, and voila! I was cured.  A barely discernable red spot was left on normal looking skin.\r\n\r\nI suppose that now that I'm on the express train to middle age, I can expect more weird growths and pains.  But maybe -- just maybe -- I'm a freak who's aging in reverse.  Have you ever heard on anyone else's weird growths just taking care of themselves?\r\n\r\nSpeaking of aging, there's an Italian restaurant near our house called Monjuni's.  Their food is pretty good, but their staff appears to be made up entirely of sixteen year olds, and their service is expectedly poor.  We ate there Saturday night (mere hours after my miracle healing), and I was quite surprised that the waiter we had had on our previously visit was still employed there.\r\n\r\nThe oddest thing about Monjuni's is the number of old people with walkers that you see there.  I don't want it to sound like I'm making fun of people with walkers.  I'm not.  I just don't understand why they (as a group) eat at Monjuni's more than at other places in town.\r\n\r\n<table cellpadding=\"2\" align=\"right\"><tr><td width=\"5\" rowspan=\"2\"><spacer type=\"block\" width=\"5\" height=\"1\"><\/spacer><\/td><td width=\"250\" ><img src=\"\/img\/monjunis.jpg\" width=\"245\"\/><\/td><\/tr><tr><td class=\"caption\" width=\"250\">The entrance to Monjuni's, uncharacteristically without a person with a walker.<\/td><\/tr><\/table>\r\n\r\nBefore Saturday, I had eaten there in person once, and ordered takeout from there twice.  On each visit, I had seen a person with a walker.  On Saturday, there were three patrons with walkers.  This is way out of line with a random disbursement of patrons with walkers to restaurants in town.\r\n\r\nDo older people just have a preference for reasonably priced lasagna with a lot of sugar in the marinara?  Do there just tend to be more elderly in our part of town?  Are they the only ones with the patience for the youthful wait staff?\r\n\r\nI'm not sure."

Now, not all of the girls who hung around got nicknames.  In fact, most of them really didn't.  I've omitted ones that include part or all of a real name, which weren't usually that funny anyway.

I did the installation of the lights in the back yard myself.  It's a much more complicated system, with three transformers and probably three times as many actual lights.  But the front yard was done by contractor.\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\r\nFor the sake of this post, let's call they guy Perry.  He was hired to do our front yard before I did the back, and therefore before I knew how easily it could have been done.  Basically, you just need to trench a path for one wire going to the left of the driveway, and one wire going to the right.  Easy as can be.  The lights snap directly to the wire, and get their low-voltage power as easily and safely as Thomas Edison could have dreamed.\r\n\r\nBut Perry's crew spent a week where they dug up every blade of liriope (looks like fancy dark monkey grass) in my front yard.  They uprooted several large, important shrubs, and turned much of the bedding into seas of mud.\r\n\r\nThen, they left all of these living plants out in the driveway to dry up, while they went home over a three day weekend.  Then, they didn't even return to finish up on the next work day.  We replaced tons of dead plants after it was over.\r\n\r\nAnd that's just the tip of the iceberg.  The letter I sent in response to the final bill that we refused to pay documented 10 or 12 instances of damages, work unfinished, and failures to show up on schedule.\r\n\r\nPerry took Doug LLewellyn's advice and started the process of going to court.  But it seems that he started with Judge Mathis.  We got the letter from the Judge Mathis show several months before being served papers for the actual suit.\r\n\r\nI think Perry wanted to do the Judge Mathis show, because there's no way to lose.  See, if you are the one who was sued, and if you lose, the show pays your damages.  If you are the one who filed suit and you lose, the show pays you anyway.  On top of all of this, you get a free trip to Chicago.  Doesn't get much better than that, does it?\r\n\r\n<table cellpadding=\"2\" align=\"right\"><tr><td width=\"5\" rowspan=\"2\"><spacer type=\"block\" width=\"5\" height=\"1\"><\/spacer><\/td><td width=\"250\" ><img src=\"\/img\/judgemathis.jpg\"\/><\/td><\/tr><tr><td class=\"caption\" width=\"250\">Judge Mathis<\/td><\/tr><\/table>\r\n\r\nI checked out the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.askjudgemathis.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Judge Mathis web site<\/a> this week, and the most interesting part is the link where you can request the good Judge as a speaker for your seminar.  His speaking fee is up to $15,000, and he requires a first class plane ticket, as well as a ticket and accommodations for an assistant.\r\n\r\nI can't help but wonder about who in the world would want a television judge to speak at their event.  If you haven't watched his show, then you should check it out (just once).  This guy isn't Judge Wapner.  He tries to be all \"in your face\" for good television.  Good television, it is not.  Neither is it good jurisprudence.  Having Judge Mathis as your speaker will not impress your employees or clients.\r\n\r\nIn case you were still wondering, we decided to pass on Judge Mathis.  Perry let the whole matter drop when he saw his fifth-grade level lawsuit responded to with a legal brief filled with \"heretofore\" and \"whereby\" and lots of indecipherable mumbo jumbo.\r\n\r\nBut I really think he was just looking to be on Judge Mathis."

I didn't get too obnoxious with it.  It was just a medium-volume, low-pitched booooooooo, similar to what I would do when the opponents come out on court to warm up before a basketball game.\r\n<!--more--><br \/><br \/>I didn't really think about doing this to the poor woman; it just came naturally.  I didn't realize that I was acting like an ass until I looked up from my keyboard and noticed others staring at me.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nSo I did what any egotist would:  I started laughing at myself.  About a minute and a half later, still laughing, I realized that I should have been apologetic.  I hollered a half-hearted, \"Oh, sorry about that.  Welcome aboard!\" which probably wasn't heard anyway, since the walking tour had continued on to other areas.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nSeveral years ago, a company that we considered to be an important strategic partner came to demonstrate some of their software.  I was one of 15 to 20 people invited to watch the demo in a large conference room.  They had a sales lady at the podium performing the demo, and several of their executives in the audience.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nIt was a little slow.  The lady was going through the motions of entering a loan application in a web browser form.  It's hard to make that very exciting.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nShe got to a field where she was supposed to select the type of decisioning that their system would run.  Since they were a new partner to us, our company's products weren't listed, so she picked one that would work for her demo.  Somewhere in the name she selected was the acronym for a little-known competitor of ours.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe guy who was Chief Sales Officer at the time (a guy named Brett -- not <a href=\"http:\/\/www.theskinnyonbenny.com\/blog\/archives\/00000131.php\">Date Rape Dan<\/a>) was not one who would have normally been characterized as stable.  But he had been well behaved up to this point.  But, he lost his battle for appropriate behavior when the lady picked a competitor's product.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nHe put his fist over his mouth, lowered his voice a fake octave below normal, and let out a loud, bellowing \"SSSUUUUUUKKKKKKSSSSS.\"<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nWell, the lady at the podium didn't really understand that this was directed at her selection.  In her mind, she was ten minutes into the demo, and the CSO of this strategic partner was telling her bosses that the demo sucks.  And he wasn't doing it during open discussion.  He just interrupted her speaking to holler it out in front of everyone.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nUnderstandably, this blew her concentration by quite a bit.  She stuttered for a half minute, and then just gave up and quit talking altogether.  The room sat silent for a long 10 seconds.  Then ten more.  No one spoke or even laughed.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThis was certainly one of the most awkward professional moments that I can remember.  I remember looking down at my notepad, afraid that eye contact with my coworkers might push me into a solo fit of laughter, making things even worse.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nAfter another half minute of complete silence, she regained her form, and continued with the demo.  The little outburst was never mentioned or acknowledged in any way.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nBut I would pay $100 to hear what they said about it on their drive away from our building.\r\n"

Mrs. theskinnyonbenny was out of town, so I had the house to myself.  I decided to make a pot of coffee.\r\n<!--more--><br \/><br \/>Our coffee maker is one of those that keeps a pot's worth of water hot, so that you don't have to wait the couple of minutes to heat the water that you put in.  For sure, a good feature on a pot that you use every day.  But maybe not on a maker that you haven't used in three weeks.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe first pot I tried was a failure.  The preceding three weeks of keeping the water warm had evaporated my reserve, so that all I got was a trickle of really thick, sludgy coffee.  It wasn't enough for a cup full, but it wouldn't have been drinkable had there been enough anyway.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nFor the second pot, I left the same grounds in, and tried with full supply of water.  Unfortunately, the amount of coffee grounds I put into the plastic bucket overwhelmed the system.  The water coming into the bucket (is there a real name for that part of the coffee maker?) came faster than the water could trickle through the grounds and filter and leave the bottom of the bucket.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe inevitable result was that the coffee started coming out of the top of the machine, spitting brown liquid full of grounds all over the counter, sink, floors, and part of the refrigerator.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nBy the time I had this cleaned up, I was 40 minutes into my day without coffee.  I started pot 3 but with 3 tablespoons of coffee grounds instead of four.  <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n(Note:  when I measure tablespoons, I really mean one of my soup spoons, in which I make a big, rounded scoop.  I'm sure the actual measurement is nowhere near an actual tablespoon.)<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nFinally, pot number three made without any disaster.  But it was a weak, tasteless coffee.  But at least it was hot, and wasn't all over the floor.\r\n"

The first thing to understand is that our house was built before that most innovative technology:  insulation.  There's none in the walls, there's none above the ceiling, and there certainly isn't any beneath the wood floors, built on piers above a big, cold, muddy plain beneath the house.\r\n<!--more--><br \/><br \/>And because summer is so miserable, we have the biggest, hungriest, turbo-powered air conditioning unit that average people could possibly afford.  But it's just as powerful a heater.  The result of this is that the house turns into a sweltering rain forest, complete with monkeys calling from upstairs and the occasional flash of Macaw plumage within about five minutes of cranking on the heater.  So, we usually just leave the central heat off.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nWithout insulation, it takes little time for the 40-degree air to seep into the house, and cool it down.  Most of the time, this isn't a problem.  The gas fireplace warms the TV room to bearable, and the down comforter makes sleep possible.  Most other activity comes to a halt.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe exception is in the old bathroom downstairs.  It was probably the only bathroom in the house originally.  It has one of those old in-wall, fire hazard gas heaters.  Then, during some subsequent renovation, someone put in a modern light\/vent\/heat fixture in the ceiling.  I turn on both the electric heater and the gas heater and run a hot bath.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nNormally, within 15 or 20 minutes, my chill is gone, and I've turned into a fat, pink, sweating body bobbing gently in a steamy pool.  At that point, I could walk naked through a snowstorm for 100 yards or so before feeling chilly again.  It's quite nice to be that hot when the house is so cold.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nMy current problem is that cat who I call \"Director of Aquatics.\"  He has a fascination with all things related to the plumbing.  As soon as he hears a sink running, or hears you splashing around in the tub, he has to be there to oversee the experience.  Rarely do I finish a shower without opening the curtain to find him there.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nHis biggest threat (although he has no idea) is that I will piss over the back of his head, as he steps up on hind legs to get a look into the bowl as I urinate.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nLast night, I started a bath, but hesitated before closing the door.  I knew the Director of Aquatics would be banging on it with his paws as soon as I got wet, forcing me out of the tub and into the still-cold room to open it for him.  Don't suggest that I could ignore the racquet he makes when he detects unauthorized use of the plumbing.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nSo, I decided to leave the door open a crack.  Just wide enough for a skinny cat to slide through.  Unfortunately, the dog decided to nudge it all the way open.  I didn't want to get out of the warm water, so I just let my double-heated air rush out into the frigid house, to be disbursed and cooled.  <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nMy bathroom never did warm up right, but at least the Director of Aquatics was happy.\r\n"

I had been waiting for this to become available since hearing about the music genome project on an <a href=\"http:\/\/www.npr.org\/templates\/story\/story.php?storyId=4661167\r\n\">NPR story<\/a>.\r\n<!--more--><br \/><br \/>Here's the jist of it:  they had a bunch of music experts listen to thousands and thousands of songs, and categorize something like 80 technical qualities about the sounds that only music theorists really understand.  Then, you tell the system what artists or songs you like, and the system looks for songs that are musically similar based on those categorizations.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI set up a few channels a couple of weeks ago.  When songs I don't like come up, I give it a thumbs down.  When a particularly good one comes up, I give it a thumbs up.  The system keeps track of this, learns my preferences, and makes better and better suggestions.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nAfter a couple of weeks, it is just about perfect.  It plays song after song after song, and I like them all.  And it's playing 75% songs I've never heard before.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nNow, here's the amazing part.  I started with a list of mostly hard rock artists I like:  Jane's Addiction, Foo Fighters, etc.  I figured I would get back hard rock only.  But, it comes back with a lot of folksy alt-rock and some pop, and I even got one tune that I would classify as \"funk.\"  The common thread: all of it is really good.  It's algorithm is somehow good enough to filter out all of the pop music that I don't like.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThere's a menu item that you can click to tell you why it's playing a certain song.  It's basically a way to ask the artificial intelligence which characteristics of the song matched the things it thinks you like.  Here are some examples that I got back:<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<blockquote>Based on what you've told us so far, we're playing this track because it features mellow rock instrumentation, a subtle use of vocal harmony, mild rhythmic syncopation, acoustic sonority and major key tonality.<\/blockquote><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<p>Of course, I have no idea what this means.  I probably know someone or other who could explain \"mild rhythmic syncopation\" or \"acoustic sonority,\" but I won't remember to ask.  The one thing that I need to tell it is that female vocalists are okay.  I don't get any sings with female singers at all.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nHere's a five-song playlist of songs I never heard before this morning.  I know that no one will actually follow up and try to listen to any of these, because I see such things, and I don't follow up and try to listen.<\/p><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<ul><li>Jets to Brazil - You're Having the Time of My Life<br \/>\r\n<\/li><li>So Beautiful - Dashboard Confessional<br \/>\r\n<\/li><li>Placebo - Pure Morning<br \/>\r\n<\/li><li>Diamond Nights - Dirty Thief<\/li><\/ul><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<p>Happy listening.<\/p>\r\n"

Every item had some little animal visible, giving 1970s parents across the nation the misguided notion that their kids would look as cool as those kids wearing genuine izods.  Their gimmick was that every piece of clothing with one animal on it would match every other cloth with that same animal.  It's a very good idea (I could certainly use such a system as an adult), but one that was doomed by stretchy cheap polyester as the material of choice.\r\n<!--more--><br \/><br \/>I haven't really thought about Garanimals until Friday, when they came up twice in one day.  First was when I read a message from Jodie, who wants to do something similar for children's fashion, but with corny food related names rather than animals.  I'll do my best not to give away any trade secrets, but chances are that if you feel like you should put your kid's shorts on top of a bowl of ice cream, that some of your money made it into Jodie's checking account.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe best part of the exchange was actually this clip, regarding her husband's proposed company name, which left out her initial:<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<blockquote>not only are you trying to cut your friends out...but you're trying to cut your wife out, too.<br \/>\r\nthis is sad.  i don't know if i can go into business with someone this manipulative.  being married to you is one thing, but business is business.<\/blockquote><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<p>We all need to resolve to use, \"this is sad\" in our writing more often.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nAnyway, it was later that night when we went to a local sports bar to watch the LSU\/Miami bowl game, where we ran into Rex.  Rex was a friend of ours during college.  He was known for his regularity at the campus bars, and for blurting out drunken nonsense  (\"ASPARAGUS!!!\"....\"Yassir Arafat called to see if you were going out tonight\"....miscellaneous Spanish, which was probably nonsense).  He was also older than most of us, and the rumors were that he was anywhere from early thirties to late forties back when we were in our twenties.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nRex actually looks younger now than he did in college, which isn't really saying much more than that he isn't yet wheelchair bound.  Coincidentally, his shirt appeared to be a cotton polo style Garanimal.  It was blue and peach colored, and had a pelican to show which pants to wear with it.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n(That makes me wonder, do the khaki pants in the Garanimals collection just have the logo of every single animal, lined up side by side?)<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nWe drank steadily and watched the first half of football, and I really enjoyed catching up with Rex.  At halftime, he cut himself off, as his pager had been steadily buzzing to get him to come do his X-ray tech job.  Apparently, setting up X-rays is something you can do after five bourbons.  But he had a number of good stories for us while he was there.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nFor example, he had recently gone to pick up some middle of the night hot dogs at the Wienerschnitzel on Highland Road.  Back in college, there was always a middle of the night run to either Wienerschnitzel or to Taco Bell.  (I was partial to Taco Bell, unless I was really, really short of money.  Like if I was paying in pennies, Wienerschnitzel was the first choice.)<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nRex noticed that the guy working the Schnit in the middle of the night was the exact same Asian student who had been working there all of those years ago.  He asked about it.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n\"Aren't you the same guy who was working here about 12 years ago?\"<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n\"Yes sir, you have a very good memory.\"<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n\"I thought you were a grad student finishing a degree.\"<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n\"Yes.  I am finished with school now.\"<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n\"So there are no jobs in your field of study.\"<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n\"No.\"  (Hangs head in shame.)<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nYou would think that the guy could move up to Burger King, or at least to the day shift at the Schnit after twelve years of service.  I suspect that he isn't really a go-getter.  This is sad.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<\/p>\r\n"

That's just crazy.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nBy far, the biggest drawback of Cox's standard issue DVR box is the fact that it sometimes just decides not to record your show.  There seems to be no rhyme or reason, and an informal poll tells me that it happens to some people more than others.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nWe used to have TIVO instead of the cable DVR.  There are several things that were better about TIVO:<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<ul><li>Online scheduling:  If you forgot to set your DVR for something, you can just log onto a web site, and schedule the recording from wherever you are.  Very good feature.<br \/><br \/><\/li><li>Quality control:  Chose to record programs in lower quality, and use less space on your disk.  It's nice to be able to control that.<br \/><br \/><\/li><li>Home media:  Assuming your TIVO is hooked to your whole home entertainment system, it can be used to stream your MP3's from your stereo through the computer.  However, the user interface for this is kludgy, and it loses its connection with annoying regularity.<br \/><br \/><\/li><li>There are some TIVO boxes that allow you to burn your programming to DVD.<br \/><br \/><\/li><li>Better yet, some boxes will let you copy the programs to your computer.  This will allow you to share video illegally, and to upload it to your portable devices.  A pretty good feature if you ask me.<\/li><\/ul><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<p>TIVO has also announced (but not released) a feature that would let you watch programming from other TIVO boxes.  This would not only work for two boxes in the same house, but also across the internet.  So, if the Saints game is blacked out in your city, you could be watching that game -- a second or two behind the live broadcast -- from your friend's TIVO in a different state.  <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI haven't heard them tout this in a long time, so someone must have gotten wise to the potential copyright Pandora's box that this would unleash.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nOn the other hand, the DVR has two big features that are both huge:<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<ul><li>Two tuners:  You can watch one program while a different one is recording.  Or if you aren't watching TV, you can record two at once.  The disk access speed is good enough to be recording two, while you watch a 3rd recorded program.  I've tried, and it works.<br \/><br \/><\/li><li>HD:  This is the biggie.  It's inexplicable that TIVO doesn't yet support HDTV programming.  They didn't see that coming?  I would chose DVR over TIVO for that one feature alone.<\/li><\/ul><\/p><p><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nIf only it would record everything that it's programmed to record.<br \/>\r\n\r\n<\/p>"

It was a real high-fluff, low-content thing from a good speaker who knew nothing about the realities of doing business. <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe program was really hokey, but I distinctly remember that Steve Helmke was enthusiastically into it, offering suggestions, asking questions, and adopting their lingo on the fly.

It asked which LSU coach was the best.  The results were...<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<table cellpading=\"15\"><tr><td width=150>John Brady<\/td><td width=150>Men's Basketball<\/td><td>3.42%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Pokey Chatman<\/td><td>Women's Basketball<\/td><td>83.15%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Smoke Leval<\/td><td>Baseball<\/td><td>2.60%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Les Miles<\/td><td>Football<\/td><td>10.82%<\/td><\/tr><\/table>\r\n<!--more--><br \/><br \/>Wow, who would have suspected such a skewed result?  Especially since it's skewed in favor of the coach of a minor sport, a woman, and an African-American.  Perhaps the business people in Baton Rouge aren't the Neanderthals that I had imagined that they are.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThere's a ton of interesting information in that result, but let's compare Pokey and Smoke.  When you start thinking about it, they have a lot in common:<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<ul><li>They coach a sport that is somewhere above the minor sports (swimming, volleyball, etc.) and the majors (football, men's basketball).<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<\/li><li>They both go by a goofy nickname instead of a real first name.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<\/li><li>They both inherited their program from one of the all time coaching giants of their sport.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<\/li><li>They were both hand-chosen by their coaching giant to be the successor.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<\/li><li>They both took their teams to the championship round of their first season (College World Series is roughly the baseball equivalent of basketball's Final Four).  If you count the half season where Pokey ran the team, you can apply that commonality to their first two seasons.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<\/li><li>Both teams are consistently highly ranked during the course of their seasons.<\/li><\/ul><br \/>\r\n<p>So what is the difference that makes public opinion favor Pokey so strongly?  I don't have the foggiest idea.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nBut don't take this to mean that I disagree.  In my mind, Pokey is obviously the best coach in the group.  Just because I can't iterate an argument for \"why\" doesn't change my opinion.  <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n(Here's one guess:  Pokey speaks intelligently and engages the fans at the game.  Smoke sounds like an old country guy -- which he is, and doesn't make you prod when he represents the school to outsiders.  That has nothing to do with how well they coach, but could possibly explain the perception.  Still, my opinion is that Chatman is the better coach -- not that she's the better promoter.  So I'm back to unsure about the answer.  I guess I've beat this topic to death.)<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nBefore I leave the topic of baseball for the remainder of the post, I want to point out that LSU has released its <a href=\"http:\/\/www.lsusports.net\/ViewArticle.dbml?SPSID=27865&SPID=2173&DB_LANG=C&DB_OEM_ID=5200&ATCLID=212366\" target=\"_blank\">list of bat girls<\/a> for the upcoming season.  This is a little amusing for two reasons.  First, and most obviously, it is non-news.  Was anyone other than these girls' parents waiting for such an announcement?  Second, if you check out the article and scroll down, you will see an astounding number of girls selected. <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI understand the advantage of having as many cute college girls as possible at each game, but they've selected dozens of them.  And then, there are a handful of alternates.  As if the dozens that they selected couldn't handle it if a few of them got sick.  I figure that they need about three per game.  Tops.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nGetting back to football, I'm obviously disappointed about the fact that all of the New Year's Day games bypassed LSU.  For crying out loud, the team is 10-2, with one loss at the very beginning of the season (and after having their world rocked by two hurricanes), and one was in the conference championship game.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nIt makes no sense that Number 21 Wisconsin plays on New Years Day.  Number 13 Alabama -- coming off two consecutive losses, including one to LSU -- got the SEC's Cotton Bowl slot.  Overrated West Virginia (Number 11) plays in the Sugar Bowl.  Meanwhile, Numbers 9 and 10 (LSU and Miami) play in the Peach Bowl on December 30.  It makes no sense.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nAfter the Tigers' lackluster performance in the SEC Championship game on Saturday, Les Miles is taking a lot of heat for being a poor coach on the local talk shows.  Although I'm not sure whether or not Les is one who will keep LSU competing for conference championships for years to come, you can't knock this season:  10-1 in the regular season, played in the conference championship game.  I'll take any coach who can do that 1 year out of 3.  It's not easy to win the division.  Remember, Nick Saban didn't go to the championship game last year, and he went out a hero.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nOn the other hand, I can't fathom that Miles actually <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wfaa.com\/sharedcontent\/dws\/spt\/colleges\/cottonbowl\/stories\/120305dnspocotton.1c951582.html\" target=\"_blank\">went to Dallas<\/a> to lobby the Cotton Bowl in case of a championship game loss.  Any other coach in the country would have told the athletic director something like, \"Are you out of your mind?  I'm trying to win a championship game over here!\"<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nIn fact, while we were watching the game on Saturday, Mrs. theskinnyonbenny had the nerve to ask about who the Tigers might play in the Cotton Bowl.  She received an ugly, scornful reaction from the real football fans for daring to even mention it.  It was a sincere reaction too -- we were angered by her willingness to give up on the team during the game.  To find out that the <i>head coach<\/i>, of all people had done the same thing before the game kicked off makes me wonder.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI guess I'll go with this opinion for now:  Miles had a good season, and we should be pleased.  He's younger than most head coaches in the league, and he's probably still a bit wet behind the ears.  He'll probably make fewer dumb decisions each year.  Time will tell if he's a great (or even good) SEC coach or not.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThat gets everything out of my system that I had to say about sports, so if you're bored with the topic, I'm done for a little while.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nBy the way, we're still the 2003 National Champions!<br \/>\r\n<\/p>\r\n"

There's no meat.\" It's true that there's not much flesh on chicken feet but that's not the reason why fans enjoy them...and, hello, McFly, the nails are clipped. Anyway, the appeal of chicken feet is more nuanced than simply tearing a hunk of muscle off bone and gnashing it. If you've ever eaten chicken feet, then you know the first sensation to greet you is the velvety smooth skin, so delicate it peels easily off of the diminutive bones. Following the tantalizing texture is the perky sweetness of the dish that will make your taste buds jump for joy. Finally and unexpectedly, you'll be pleased by how succulent the tendon and ligaments are.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nTo achieve these pleasant characteristics the chicken feet are cooked in a four-part process. Basically, they cook the hell out of it. How else would you turn skin-tight, tendony, throwaway parts not even a famished, rabid hyena would eat into a small culinary miracle? Not surprisingly, chicken feet's explosion of flavor comes from a dream team of seasoning and spices - star anise, chile, garlic, ginger, sugar, soy sauce and black bean converge to form a savory magic potion. You will taste every pod of spice, dash of seasoning and drop of sauce when you wriggle your tongue in ways you never thought you could, maneuvering and coaxing every delicious, edible bit off of the bone.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nChicken feet is infamously difficult to eat but once you've mastered the technique you'll be spitting out clean bones like a tommy gun blasts rounds of bullets. Eating chicken feet is like learning to tango with your tongue; only here a chicken's foot is your dance partner. Ladies, if you're one of those talented honeys hangin' out at bars tying maraschino cherry stems with only your tongue, then polishing off a tin of chicken feet will be a snap. Also, any woman who's never tasted chicken feet and tries it, automatically gets the Extreme Makeover bump in my eyes - she's instantly sexier. What can I say? Chicken feet: it's cheaper than a nip and tuck.<\/font><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<\/blockquote><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI should site <a href=\"http:\/\/deependdining.blogspot.com\/2005_01_01_deependdining_archive.html\" target=\"_blank\">the original page<\/a> where this brilliantly written review appeared.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nIf you're interest is piqued, you can try chicken feet at Dim Sum on Airline Highway in Baton Rouge.  Let me know if it's as good as it sounds.<br \/>\r\n\r\n"

Assuming that the bull's testicle is roughly round like ours, someone pounds them flat before battering and frying them.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nAfter they're cooked, the fry batter is all that you taste anyway.  They are kind of firm -- a little firmer than fried eggplant would be, but similar tasting.  I cleaned my plate.  They aren't hard to get down, once you make yourself forget what it is that you're eating.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nMy other new experience was a mud wrap in the spa.  It was kind of fun too, but not really what I expected.  (This isn't all that interested, so if you're busy, go ahead and quit reading now.)<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nYou start by laying on a table, naked as a jaybird, save a tiny little strip of towel placed strategically over the butt crack or the privates, depending on whether you are face up or face down.  The chick applying the treatment brushes the skin with a hairbrush.  Then, she takes some mud in a tin and microwaves it for a little while.  She uses a paintbrush to apply the mud all over the body.  It goes on piping hot, but gets pretty chilly as it dries.  After one application of mud, she flops you over, places the strategic piece of cloth, and does the other side.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nAfter you are covered in mud, you get covered by a couple of giant, hot towels.  Then, some heavy plastic wrap (which you've been lying on top of) gets wrapped all around you, so that you're laying on the table like a giant muddy fish behind the butcher counter.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThere's a wait, and then a giant set of car wash nozzles moves back and forth to hose you off.  Another flip, and more car wash jets.  This part is a lot of fun.  You can't really see the room so much, but it must get drenched.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nAfter that, it's downhill.  Some lotion, soft-feeling and nice smelling.  Another flip over here, a fresh loincloth there.  Then, it wraps up.<br \/>\r\n\r\n"

But most of my friends were 16 and driving, so it was the best of both worlds.  And this isn't one of those \"I didn't know how well I had it\" types of posts.  I knew that it was great even at the time.<br \/>\r\n\r\n<!--more--><br \/><br \/>A group of us went that summer to the Bryan Adams concert.  I had a dentist appointment that morning, and it was decided that I needed to have a couple of incoming wisdom teeth removed.  <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n\"We've got time.  Let's do it now.\"<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI whined and complained but was overridden.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nHere's a tip for parents:  if the dentist has nothing better to do than recommend non-emergency procedures, and then has the time to take care of them right away, then it's probably a good-for-nothing dentist.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThis was in the oh so innocent days before people in Little Rock, Arkansas got AIDS, so the dentist worked in my mouth bare-handed.  I remember distinct times being able to smell\/taste the grits that he had for breakfast.  What kind of lunatic eats grits with his bare hands before practicing dentistry is anybody's guess.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nRegardless of the fact that the quack had yanked out a couple of wisdom teeth, I went with my friends to the concert.  We went to Wendy's first, and the pain and\/or the medication made it very difficult to eat.  I also felt nauseous.  I actually considered calling and getting a ride back home, but I decided to at least ride to the arena before making the decision to bail.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nIt's odd.  I can picture the girl who drove, and for that summer, we were pretty good friends.  She was a big (but not fat) chick with a huge head of 80s hair.  I can picture her, her car, and even today, I could take you right to the house where she lived.  But for the life of me, I can't remember her name.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI know that we were comfortable enough with each other to bandy around the word \"piss\" right in front of Culson Johnson's mom.  It went back and forth between us before we noticed her stare, which shamed us into an apology.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<embed NAME=\"nsplay\" PLUGINSPAGE=\"http:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/windows\/mediaplayer\/download\/default.asp\" SRC=\"\/sound\/AintGonnaCry.mp3\" TYPE=\"video\/x-ms-wmf-plugin\"  AUTOSTART=\"0\" SHOWCONTROLS=\"1\"  align=\"right\" \/><noembed>You'll have to find this song somewhere else.  Your browser won't allow embedded media.  Sorry.<\/noembed><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nOnce we got to the arena, I felt a lot better.  And it ended up being a good show.  I had an old Bryan Adams song randomly come up on the IPOD playlist the other day, and it still holds up as a good 1980s rock and roll song.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI'm fortunate to have caught the pre-pussy act.\r\n"

Therefore, he was known far and wide as someone to be disliked and mistrusted.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nHe kept a large photo of himself and his wife on his desk, where he wore some military uniform that included a big \"Smokey the Bear\" hat.  It was the funniest desk photo in the office.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nOne day, I put that photo up in the center of a filing cabinet surrounded by some burning candles and a stick of unlit incense.

		"post_content" : "Wednesday and Thursday last week were a pain in the ass.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nTo start with, Wednesday is the one night of the week that I should be in front of the TV.  I haven't done too many posts this year about what I'm watching on TV, but if I ever get around to reviewing the good and the bad on TV this fall, then you will see that Wednesday is important.  For example, Wednesday at 8:00 is the only double-DVR hour of the week with <i>Lost<\/i>, <i>Veronica Mars<\/i>, and <i>Apprentice: Martha Stewart<\/i> vying for viewers.\r\n<!--more--><br \/><br \/><div><p>The last two weeks, I've left the DVRs churning to help handle Satchmo or Ella during their dog training.  (Satchmo is the one you might have seen in <a href=\"http:\/\/theskinnyonbenny.com\/dailyphoto\/page.php?year=2005&month=11&day=02\">here<\/a>, and Ella is his sister.  I'm not complaining about that.  They are fun dogs, and I like working with them.  I thought Satchmo had proven that he wasn't as dumb as advertised when he nailed a \"come and sit\" drill right off the bat.  But then, he tried to eat three pebbles off the ground as class progressed.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe pain in the ass started right after that.  I had to pick up a rental car.  You see, I found out at about 4:30 PM on Wednesday that I had to be in Montgomery, AL for a 9:00 meeting the next morning.  There were no flights available, so I was going to have to make the five hour drive.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI drew the short straw at the Hertz counter and got a Chevy Malibu.  Bitchin.  No GPS, no satellite navigation.  Instead, it had the check engine light perpetually illuminated for my entertainment.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI started driving just before 4:00 on Thursday morning.  I don't really mind a long drive by myself too too much.  I listened to music from my IPOD, and I was part way through an audiobook, so after my brain went into the \"road trip space out,\" the time passed fairly quickly.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThere were two portents of good luck.  At 5:00, I was just into Mississippi (clearly making a pretty good pace of it), and I saw the first shooting star that I've seen in several years.  It started mid-sky, right in front of me and appeared to move down, disappearing behind the black silhouettes of the tree line.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nFour and a half hours later, I was driving through wooded desolation well south of Montgomery.  I saw what looked like a child's kite gliding over the interstate, which was deserted except for me.  I slowed and looked up as I passed under it, recognizing the unmistakable head of a bald eagle.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI made it to my meeting right on time, and could have easily made it with time to spare.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI have a number of methods for coping with long, dull meetings.  One is to keep writing, no matter how irrelevant the topic becomes.  As long as my hand is writing something, I tend to pay some attention.  This method also gives the benefit of being able to reflect on notes like these.  You can click on any of the images to see the full sized text, in case you have trouble reading them.<\/p><\/div><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<div><center><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"window.open('\/img\/regnotes1.jpg')\"><img src=\"\/img\/regnotes1.jpg\" width=\"600\"\/><\/a><\/center><\/div><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<div><p>I've pretty much decided that it was indeed <i>not<\/i> my B. O., as I did not smell it again after I left the meeting.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI decided against posting the second snip of text that I was going to include.  I have a little census, where I counted the males, females, Caucasians, and minorities that were in on the meeting.  The gag is that I included \"redneck\" as a distinct ethnic group.  If you want to see it, shoot me an email, and I'll share it with you.<\/p><\/div><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<div><center><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"window.open('\/img\/regnotes3.jpg')\"><img src=\"\/img\/regnotes3.jpg\" width=\"600\"\/><\/a><\/center><\/div><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<div><center><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"window.open('\/img\/regnotes4.jpg')\"><img src=\"\/img\/regnotes4.jpg\" width=\"600\"\/><\/a><\/center><\/div><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<div><p>My guess on who would represent this company was way off.  It ended up being just one guy, and he wasn't there to look slick at all.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nWe also got to review a consulting report provided by one of their other vendors.  I won't mention the company by name, but if you know who put the green Start button at the bottom left of your computer screen, you have a good idea about this report.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI won't reveal anything that gives away any secrets or anything, but the report wasn't even labeled \"Confidential.\"  In fact, it was the least professional consulting report I could imagine.  Here are my two favorite parts:<\/p><\/div><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<div><center><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"window.open('\/img\/msreport1.jpg')\"><img src=\"\/img\/msreport1.jpg\" width=\"600\"\/><\/a><\/center><\/div><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<div><p>Clear as can be.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThis next paragraph spanned a page break, so just read it as if it were connected.<\/p><\/div><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<div><center><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"window.open('\/img\/msreport2a.jpg')\"><img src=\"\/img\/msreport2a.jpg\" width=\"600\"\/><\/a><\/center><\/div><br \/>\r\n<div><center><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"window.open('\/img\/msreport2b.jpg')\"><img src=\"\/img\/msreport2b.jpg\" width=\"600\"\/><\/a><\/center><\/div><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<div><p><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI almost forgot to mention this:  during the meeting, a person from the client's site referred to \"Spike and Shaggy.\"  From the context, I knew these were nicknames for my co-workers.  I asked and found out later which guys are referred to as \"Spike and Shaggy.\"  I don't think it's common knowledge in Baton Rouge.  <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI won't spoil the surprise now.  Go ahead APPRO people, and speculate amongst yourselves.  Here's one hint:  one of them is still around, and one doesn't work with us any more.  Gambling is encouraged.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe drive home was probably my favorite part of the day.  Mostly because I was going home, but the two Red Bulls didn't hurt either.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI spent the whole five hour drive home chewing up a cheap gas station cigar, and spitting the green-brown tobacco spit into an empty coke bottle.  Only by myself can I behave that way.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nBy myself is also the only time I can choose my playlist (no one I know likes all of the songs that I do) and turn the volume up really, really loud.  The volume is necessary to drown out my singing, which is also loud, but important.  <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe last hour of loud, obnoxious singing next to a clear bottle of green-brown spittle was almost fun.<br \/>\r\n<\/p><\/div>\r\n"

Looking out the rear or sides gives no indication whether you are by pastures, lakes, mountains, or just zipping through outer space.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThere was a thin sliver of moon this weekend, and Saturday night, a bright planet slid down past it.  The brightness from the star was enough to cause a slight shadow of lighter black on the deep dark ground.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nNatchitoches is the main town in that area, although it is just a tiny little place, with only the slight charm.  Surprisingly, there are two productions going on in town right now:  a movie whose name I forget that seems to be a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.theskinnyonbenny.com\/blog\/archives\/00000012.php\">geezer movie<\/a>, and a pilot for some TV show.  <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nWe went by the hospital Friday night on our way to a Mexican restaurant in order to give Mrs. theskinnyonbenny's mother the chance to read an X-ray that was important to someone or other.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nOutside of her office, they had a section of hallway screened off with lights and booms and things.  While we waited, we wandered over to check it out.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nMost of the action was happening around a corner where we couldn't see too well.  There was a young girl in jeans, sitting on the floor next to a bunch of equipment.  While we looked around, an old woman in a robe and shower cap came around the corner and sat down in a small unused waiting area.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nWe poked around a little, and at one point got to an area where a guy in a T-shirt that said, \"Shitake happens\" turned us away.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nAbout the time we got to the area with the screens and equipment, someone around the corner was yelling, \"QUIET PLEASE....ALL QUIET.\"  This was an empty hospital on a Friday night.  It seemed pretty quiet to me already.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nJust as I got bored and turned to walk away, the voice yelled \"ROLL SOUND.\"  Someone else around the corner yelled \"ROLLING,\" followed by the girl in the jeans on the floor yelling \"ROLLING.\"  Not very high tech, but she was there to start the sound taping.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI got real conscious of my own sound, knowing that the microphone was right next to me.  I walked slowly away, and it seemed like the rubber soles of my Tevas squeaked something awful on the hospital's tiled floor.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nJust at the point where I got far enough away to breathe again, Mrs. theskinnyonbenny's mother came out of her office.  Mrs. theskinnyonbenny was still standing right by the set, but when she heard the door, she forgot all about it.  She wheeled around and hollered, \"Y'ALL READY?\"<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe voice around the corner quickly yelled \"CUT!\"<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI laughed about ruining their shot all the to the Mexican restaurant (a full three blocks).<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nAll said, it was one of the most amusing weekends to the north that I've had.\r\n"

I usually start writing with a half-formed idea or two, and somehow, my brain turns them into paragraphs without it seeming like an effort.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nNot so tonight.  So I won't try the triple lindy until later in the semester.\n<!--more--><br \/><br \/>At about 4:30 this morning, I picked up my latest issue of Sports Illustrated and went to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.theskinnyonbenny.com\/blog\/archives\/00000035.php\">Louie's<\/a>.  There were a couple of interesting facts in there that I wrote down to share with you guys.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nFirst, a quick blurb about a most unfortunate college student at some division 3 school.  It seems that he was at the wrong place at the wrong time when they decided to celebrate the win by pulling down the goal posts.  He caught a goal post in his melon, and it was curtains.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nI guess there are worse ways to go.  There are few things that feel as good as a huge football win for your team (although I snobbishly doubt that a win by Minnesota-Morris is as exciting as a big LSU win).  At any rate, he was at least having a really good time right there at the end.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nThe other SI factiod that I thought was interesting is that when Jack Klugman was hired to play Oscar Madison on TV's <i>The Odd Couple<\/i>, the network bought all of his real clothes to be the wardrobe for Oscar.  It turns out that he is a lot like his character.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nI somehow suspect that Nathan Lane -- the current Oscar on Broadway could not pull any of his personal wardrobe into a suitable Oscar Madison costume.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nOne last and completely unrelated thought:  my post on <a href=\"http:\/\/www.theskinnyonbenny.com\/blog\/archives\/00000141.php\">\"My Old Man Holds Pencils\"<\/a> is getting crazy traffic from search engine hits.  It seems that I'm not the only one who wondered about his Quiznos cup.  <br \/>\n<br \/>\nSpecial things to the handful of strangers who emailed me to clear up my confusion.  One message in particular amused me, and I'm unable to articulate just why this wording makes me laugh:<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<blockquote>Benny,<br \/>\n <br \/>\nI took a quick look around your blog, I like your entry style.  But thats not why I'm here, me and my co-worker googled the saying on the side of the Quizno's cup, and he thinks he figured it out.  The cup is saying that his old man, therefore being an older cup, holds pencils.  Retarded joke, but it makes sense.  Just thought i'd let you into \"the loop\".<br \/>\n    <br \/>\nAlex<\/blockquote><br \/>\n<br \/>\nI think it's that I like how honest this reads.  Alex gives me a compliment, but barely lets me bask in it before quickly letting me know that I'm missing the point.  And then he nobly refuses to take credit for his coworker's brainchild.  Then, he concluded with his (presumably real, and not included here) phone number in his email signature.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nAlex: don't send your phone number to strangers on the internet.  I just finished dining on your cat, and will now be stalking your mother.  But thanks for reading!<br \/>\n<br \/>\n\n"

It reminds me that I told a story last week where my butt was a central figure.  Fear not; this post is not illustrated.\r\n<!--more--><br \/><br \/>When my nephew was around 6 or so, someone dropped off some wet and stick on tattoos for him.  He wasn't around when they were received, so I decided to take one of the tattoos and put it on an ass cheek.  <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe idea was that when he came to proudly show off his new tattoo, I could say, \"Wow, I have one just like that!\"  Then, I could drop my pants and get a big laugh.  Everyone knows that six year old boys (and I) find butt cheeks amazingly funny.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nMrs. theskinnyonbenny bought into this fun little prank, and agreed to administer the tattoo to my butt.  <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nAll of this occurred while vacationing with my family.  We were in some smallish beach condo somewhere or other, so we went in a bathroom to apply the tattoo.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nJust as I had my shorts around my ankles, and Mrs. theskinnyonbenny had her face right in my butt, the bathroom door opened.  I turned around to see my dad, who immediately stammered an \"Excuse me\" and shut the door very quickly.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nLet's pause to consider what sort of perverted scene he thought he walked into.  I can't even imagine.  I mean, I know that there are married couples who like to spice it up with really weird twists, but <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nAs I recall, we had only been back to the condo for five minutes or so, so the imagined scenario had to include the fact that we just couldn't wait to stick something on\/in my butt while we were out.  Was I particularly squirmy at dinner?  Did my attention wander?<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nLater, the intended joke went over swimmingly.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI bet I'm a fun uncle to have.\r\n"

By the time I got to work seven minutes (no more, no less), I would have been begging the gods for mercy.\r\n<!--more--><br \/><br \/>I'm on yet another work trip, and it's nowhere near that cold.

I was uncomfortable all day.  More specifically, my underwear was uncomfortable all day.

I guess Lili had torn them up, and they just got washed and put back into the drawer.  Or, maybe they were worn paper-thin over the years, and they just happened to go out recently.

By the time the games are important, it's football season, and regular season football ranks higher on my interest scale than post season baseball.  No question about it.\r\n<!--more--><br \/><br \/>This week, I've been working with a client in San Antonio, which is full of die-hard Astros fans.  The Stros are in the World Series this year.  I think it's their first trip to the series, but it's certainly their first in many years.  <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n(A quick internet search would answer that question, but I'm too lazy to conduct such a search.  However, I'm not too lazy to type all of this text about how lazy I am.)<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nYesterday was the first series game at home for the Astros.  It was \"wear your Astros gear to work day\" at the office, which allowed people to come to work casual, as long as they sported an Astros logo somewhere or other.  So that we wouldn't feel left out, they bought the two of us from Baton Rouge Astros caps.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nWe worked late yesterday, and by the time we left the office and got to a place to eat, the game was underway.  The Astros already had a 1-0 lead.  They had built their lead to 4 runs.  But the Sox started a comeback as we drove to the hotel.  When I got back, it was 5-4 White Sox, and I was interested.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nLittle did I know that my sudden interest would keep me up until 1:30 this morning watching -- of all godforsaken things -- major league baseball.  The Stros squandered a very good opportunity to score the winning run in the bottom of the ninth, and then both teams were shut down for inning after inning after inning after inning.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI knew I was in trouble when the ticker on the screen said,  \"Later tonight on Fox... World Series Game 5.  Houston Astros vs. Chicago White Sox.\"<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nFortunately for me -- unfortunately for the fans here -- the Astros ran out of decent pitchers in the 14th inning.  Tim McCarver told me to stay tuned for the post game report, but I had seen more baseball than I have all season up to that point.  I finally went to sleep.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nIf you are a baseball fan and haven't looked already, check out <a href=\"http:\/\/sportsillustrated.cnn.com\/baseball\/mlb\/boxscores\/2005\/10\/25\/12373_boxscore.html\" target=\"blank\">the box score<\/a>.  Both teams used an unbelievable number of players.  The strategy of who to put in and pull out, and when to do it is what kept the game interesting.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI'm not sure if I'll watch game 5 tonight or not.  Is there a football game on instead?\r\n"

She didn't say it explicitly, but clearly, she was looking for USC vs. Notre Dame updates.  What she got was this series of messages, copied and pasted dirctly from my phone.\r\n<!--more--><br \/><br \/><blockquote><br \/>\r\nMe (10\/15 13:53): <br \/>\r\nBowling Green 14 <br \/>\r\nBuffalo 7<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nMe (10\/15 13:56): <br \/>\r\nYale 14<br \/>\r\nLeihigh 6<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nMe (10\/15 14:00): <br \/>\r\nPrinceton 28<br \/>\r\nBrown 24<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nMe (10\/15 14:05): Another TD for Yale:  21-6<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nMe (10\/15 14:14): Toledo and Ball State have kicked off!!<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nShelly Williams (10\/15 14:23): You suck<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nShelly Williams (10\/15 14:27): Fuck off<br \/>\r\n<\/blockquote><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nStacie was sending a similar set of scores simultaneously.  I thought the whole exchange was amusing.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nMy other story starts with this email from Steve, sent Sunday after the tailgate.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<blockquote><br \/>\r\nis this a haiku or just a poem?<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\ncan't sleep<br \/>\r\nit's 2 AM<br \/>\r\nben's beans gave me bad gas<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\ndid you put extra fart juice in those beans? I'm curious to see if others had<br \/>\r\nthe same reaction because, if so, you could have solved our looming energy<br \/>\r\ncrisis. I could have powered my car for a week on the gas I have created in the<br \/>\r\nlast few hours.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\npoor jodie.<br \/>\r\n<\/blockquote><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nFirst of all, that isn't a haiku.  I'm hard pressed to call it a poem, but I suppose whatever lyric your muse inspires you to create has to be considered poetry.  And I'm glad that my beans were so inspiring.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nTo the main point, I did a survey over the past few days, and it seems pretty conclusive that there was additional fart juice in the jeans.  I didn't \"put\" the extra fart juice there, but it appears clear that it was there somehow.  In fact, everyone asked -- other than Mrs. theskinnyonbenny -- admited to getting gas on or shortly after Saturday.  <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n(Mrs. theskinnyonbenny just said, \"No, I didn't have guess, but your beans weren't good.\")<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nMy own personal gas started while we were still on campus.  Beer has the same effect on me, so I had an explosive situation in my intestines by the time we were picking up to leave. In fact, it lead to a pretty difficult situation for me, as the restroom in the music building had been closed by then.  I won't go into any details, in case I have a future potential employer who googles me and find his way here.\r\n"

Like the picture that would be on the CD case if people still bought CDs.\"<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n\"Yeah, see, we just need a fat naked guy to try to lie in a box.  And try to be upside down.  Or at least as close to upside down as gravity will allow.\"<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n\"You're in?  Great!\"<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nOne more note:  I read that the music on this album is as god-awful as its cover.  I haven't listened to it, so let me know if you think this is a killer CD.  Otherwise, I probably won't give it a try.<br \/>\r\n<\/div>\r\n"

Go to the convenience store for bags of ice and a big bottle of water.<br \/><br \/>The Baton Rouge paper isn't delivered to the house yet, so I resolve that I don't get to read the pre-game coverage this morning.<br \/><br \/><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<\/td><\/tr><tr><td valign=\"top\">5:30:  <\/td><td valign=\"top\">Arrive at our tailgate spot.  There was a large tent pitched right next to our tents, so I was as quiet as I could be as I set up tables, poured ice over the beer in the ice chest, and fired up the generator.<br \/><br \/>I didn't really start the generator, but I was kind of noisy.  At some point, a chick left the tent and went to finish sleeping in her car.<br \/><br \/><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<\/td><\/tr><tr><td valign=\"top\">6:00:  <\/td><td valign=\"top\">All done with the setup.  I walked Lily around campus, as she's never gotten to explore before.<br \/><br \/>There were a lot of other people who were sleepily milling around.  And then there were a couple of groups that were blaring music.  One group had classic rock, and one group had country music.  It was really bad country music too.  No anthems -- just cryin' in your beer, she left me, slow, depressing music.  It was not appropriate for a tailgate, and not appropriate for this early hour.<br \/><br \/>On the up side, I found a stand of free newspapers by the library!<br \/><br \/><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<\/td><\/tr><tr><td valign=\"top\">6:30:  <\/td><td valign=\"top\">We got back to my camp, but it's still too dark to read the paper.  There's just a glimmer of light in one corner of the sky.  So I move my chair out into the parking lot under a street light and read pre-game coverage, while Lily amused herself by chewing up a plastic cap to a Crown Royal bottle.  No telling where she found that bottle cap, but she was having too much fun to take it away from her.<br \/><br \/><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<\/td><\/tr><tr><td valign=\"top\">7:30:  <\/td><td valign=\"top\">Clay and Craig arrive with the mother of all setups for television.

The cabinet rides on a gold rolling cart, which is accessorized with plates of loyalty for LSU, ULM, and Dutchtown High School (hey, it's not my cart!).<br \/><br \/>Barely any setup was required before the setup was powered up, and we had live local TV as well as Dish Network channels.<br \/><br \/>Tyler and Shelly showed up shortly after that, and we moved from coffee to bloody marys a little while after that.<br \/><br \/><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<\/td><\/tr><tr><td valign=\"top\">8:00 - 11:00:  <\/td><td valign=\"top\">Time flew quickly during these morning hours.  People continued to arrive, and we continued to drink.  We watched Sports Center followed by ESPN College Football Gameday.  At 11:00, the Alabama\/Ole Miss game kicked off.<br \/><br \/>Somewhere in this stretch, I start cooking up a batch of beans and rice.<br \/><br \/><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<\/td><\/tr><tr><td valign=\"top\">11:00 - 2:00<\/td><td valign=\"top\">The Bama\/Ole Miss game was just the first of many, many good games this Saturday.<br \/><br \/>This was also the time that the party starts to fill up with friends of friends.  I have a lot of these second-degree friends now.  I only see them every so often, and it's gotten to where I know these people, but I can't recall their names or which first degree friend they belong to.  Fortunately, I get by with a smile, handshake, and hand them a beer.

On the one hand, you hate to see that many mistakes.  On the other hand, if you can have those mistakes and still beat Florida, you have a really good team.

		"post_content" : "Yesterday, someone handed me a menu for a new restaurant in town.  Zoe's has a regular, sandwich-heavy menu, and it's located in a new strip mall that is close to work and home.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nWhat jumped out at me was the egg sandwich on the menu.  I've been on a quest to find a good egg sandwich in Baton Rouge for a couple of years.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nMy quest started two summers ago in Saratoga.  We stayed with our friends Greg and Lisa.  They have a house there that they rent to college students during the school year.  The off season for college corresponds to the on season for horse racing, so it's home base for the short racing season up there.\r\n<!--more--><br \/><br \/>The house is full of rules.  There's a hand written sign taped by the thermostat legislating the particulars for changing the temperature.  There are signs by light switches indicating the circumstances when they may and may not be used.  <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI got my first lecture from Greg about not using one particular ice chest of his on the phone the week before we arrived.  We all heard that lecture about three more times over the course of a weekend.  Needless to say, Greg doesn't take kindly to others' beer hogging the space in his ice.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nA sign on the back door directed you to a particular pink house down the road as a good source of newspapers and sandwiches.  We went there before the races one day.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI hadn't had egg salad in years.  I don't know what possessed me to order it, but it isn't enough to call it a good egg salad sandwich.  It was the best egg salad sandwich I ever had.  It might be the best sandwich of any kind that I ever had.  It had the perfect amount of onion, salt, and pepper.  There were a few small pieces of diced tomato.  And it was served on a small, sandwich size piece of french bread that was worthy of the best po-boy shops in Louisiana.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nZoï¿½'s egg salad was good, but it doesn't deserve to be mentioned in the same post as the sandwich from the pink house.  I've talked to a few people who have eaten there, and my good but not great egg salad seems to be the best review you will get from my circle.  The other two people say that their food was bad.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<table cellpadding=\"2\" align=\"right\"><tr><td width=\"5\" rowspan=\"2\"><spacer type=\"block\" width=\"5\" height=\"1\"><\/spacer><\/td><td width=\"250\" ><img src=\"\/img\/zoes.JPG\"\/><\/td><\/tr><tr><td class=\"caption\" width=\"250\">A photo of the interior of Zoe's.  I don't know this lady who did me the favor of looking right into the camera.  I wonder what she was thinking.  I also wonder if she will ever find her picture here.<br \/><br \/>If you do (and I'm writing this caption just for you, ma'am), please <a href=\"mailto:bens@theskinnyonbenny.com\">email me<\/a> and let me know.  It would make my day.<\/td><\/tr><\/table><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nIt wasn't the food that turns me off from Zoe's; it was the atmosphere.  The place is bright with contrasting shades of aqua green and turquoise blue, with some pink and yellow pinstripes to enhance the need for sunglasses inside.  If vision was your only sense, and you found yourself in Zoe's dining room, you would think that you've been swallowed by an easter egg.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe ceiling is high and hard, and the floors are concrete.  This is to make sure that every voice in the restaurant bounces around until the whole place sounds like a loud, unruly high school cafeteria.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe final flaw is the demographics of the patrons.  We counted 52 women in the dining room on Tuesday at lunch time.  They were roughly broken down into half tennis wives, and half well dressed, elderly ladies.  By contrast, there were only 7 men who had stumbled into the restaurant, including the two of us at my table.  The proportion was overwhelming enough that being a man in this place was uncomfortable.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nWe ate quickly, and mostly without talking.  We left as soon as we could, and had to find something masculine to do before going back into the office.  <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nBottom line:  Zoe's is a good place to go if you want to find out what it's like to eat mediocre food, or if you want to find out what it might be like to have no balls.<br \/>\r\n\r\n"

All of the \"experts\" recommend rubber boots and gloves when going into post-hurricane mud.  They also insist that tetanus shots are a must.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThat sounded to me like talking heads blowing hot air.  I took no gloves, and wore Tevas.  One strap on the Tevas just covered the gaping sore on the top of my right foot.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nIt was nasty but satisfying work.  And I had no ill effects.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nAnd then Sunday, I bit into a potato chip, and my jaw really hurt when trying to chew.  Shrugging it off, I bit into a second chip, and my jaw locked into place.  This was accompanied by an excruciating pain through the left side of my face and up into my ear.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe warnings about tetanus came back to my mind.  Just to be safe, Mrs. theskinnyonbenny drove me to the doctor.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nIt didn't take long to get in to see the doc.  I was both relieved and annoyed that he laughed at me when I told him that I was worried about tetanus.  \"You would know for sure if it was tetanus.  Heck, you would be dead if it was tetanus.\"<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nIt wasn't really as comforting as he meant it to be.  I expected at least a lecture on the dangers of tromping through the contaminated mud in sandals with a wound on my foot. But I got nothing.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nHe gave me a tetanus shot -- to relieve my mind, and punish my hypochondria with a painful shoulder for a few days.  He passed the problem of my achy jaw on to a dentist.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nNow, I have periods where it's almost normal, but longer periods where my mouth won't open or won't close all the way.  It's usually painful, and it's sometimes feels like I'm being tortured.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nA coworker had a similar thing, and fought the pain for a couple of years, when it cleared itself up on its own volition.  He's clearly more of a man than I am.  I'll cry like a little girl long before I make two years of this.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nBut he thought of his alternative like this:  someone else he knew had it surgically corrected.  The pain after the surgery was intense.  It was so intense that it caused her to puke.  It's a bad thing to puke when your mouth is wired shut.  Her parents had to wipe aside the yak and go after her mouth with wire cutters from the garage, so that they wouldn't have to worry about her choking to death on her own vomit.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nIsn't that a lovely thought?\r\n"

He went to the game last week, yelled long and loud, and saw his team play pretty well in beating a mediocre Buffalo squad.  Today's game was against 0-4 Green Bay, who was additionally handicapped by multiple injuries to key players.<br \/>\r\n\r\n<!--more--><br \/><br \/>The first couple of series were good.  The Saints stopped the Packers on their first series; they drove for a field goal their first offensive series.  And then they turned into the Saints that Louisiana has always known.  A lackluster, uninspired performance slowly degraded to a humiliation.  Final score:  Packers 52, Saints 3.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThat was a little hard to type.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nJoe SA will learn not too get too bent about any particular loss.  Just as they will be astoundingly bad, they will have a few games that are impressively good.  And they will keep you thinking that they just might sneak into the playoffs.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<skinny :nohome><table cellpadding=\"2\" align=\"right\"><tr><td width=\"5\" rowspan=\"2\"><spacer type=\"block\" width=\"5\" height=\"1\"><\/spacer><\/td><td width=\"250\" ><img src=\"\/img\/favre.jpg\"\/><\/td><\/tr><tr><td class=\"caption\" width=\"250\">Green Bay quarterback Brett Favre celebrates a touchdown against the Saints earlier today.<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/skinny><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nWhen all the games are played, the Saints' record will be just bad enough to miss the playoffs, but just good enough to prevent them from getting a stud in the draft next spring.  I hope I'm wrong, but history is with me on this one.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nBack in San Antonio, Joe stuck with the game through the afternoon, just like I did.  Hundreds of miles apart, we listened to the same radio broadcast.  Joe probably mused about how brutally honest the Saints radio announcers are about poor play.  We listened through the end of the game.  We listened to the coach and players admit that they got clobbered in post-game interviews.  We heard Hoakie name broadcast engineer Dave Hernandez the player of the game in lieu of honoring an actual player in any way.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nAt some point early, Joe probably got mad at the game.  His wife probably laughed at him for caring so much.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nLast week, I got annoyed with the San Antonio fans who brought, \"San Antonio Saints\" signs to the Alamo dome.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThis made my wife laugh at me.  \"Let them have the Saints. Why do you want them sucking <i>us<\/i> down every season?\"<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nBut they're <i>our<\/i> pathetic NFL franchise.  It matters.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nLast week, we talked to some people in Philadelphia who were disdainful about their team, saying that they \"always choke in the big game.\"  The Eagles lost the Super Bowl last year.  They lost the NFC Championship game the year before.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI could only roll my eyes and try not to laugh too hard.  The Eagles have two playoff wins in the 2005 calendar year.  The Saints have one playoff win in the 39-year history of the franchise.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nTo these people, it doesn't matter that the Eagles make it to the NFC Championship game.  To Louisiana, it would be unbelievable.  I can't begin to guess the amount of celebration that would take place as the Saints advance in the playoffs. <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThat's why they have to remain ours.  We can't have people with lifetimes of fanship built up, only to watch them move to another city before learning to win.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI wonder if it will happen in my lifetime.  \r\n"

It's interesting that big cities in the north and on the coasts all have a Chinatown, but as far as I know, there isn't one in Atlanta, Dallas, Houston, Charlotte, Memphis or any other big cities in the south.  Why would that be?<br \/>\n<br \/>\nI have known for some time that Chinese people usually spoke either Mandarin or Cantonese, and that speakers of each language could not understand each other.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nBut I recently learned that their writing is the same.

Although that was (presumably) in English, I couldn't understand a word that they said.  <br \/>\n<br \/>\nThey spoke in clipped, short fast British syllables so that sentences sounded something like, \"ankh buh wot va lock.\"<br \/>\n<br \/>\nI guess they might have trouble understanding me too.  But we could have written notes to each other.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nPerhaps with another couple hundred years of language evolution without pollution from phones, radio, TV and movies, and we would have had separate English languages like Mandarin and Cantonese.<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<center><img src=\"\/img\/greenline.gif\"><\/center><br \/>\n<br \/>\n<b>Another true story<\/b><br \/>\n<br \/>\nEarlier today, I was working in a conference room at a client's site.

The office backs up to some woods, so was expecting to see a deer that had been hit by a car, or something like that.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nInstead, there was a worker from a nearby road crew.  He had walked down into the trees, dropped his pants, and was taking a big, steamy shit.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nHere's the kicker:  He was facing away from the building, in order to allow all of the ladies in the office could clearly see his turds drop.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nMost of the people turned and left pretty quickly, but one lady couldn't make herself quit watching.  One man in the office borrowed a camera phone and took a picture.  I bet the owner won't lend that phone to the same man again any time soon.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nWhen he finished up, he found something (couldn't tell what) with which to wipe himself, zipped up his pants, and walked up to the road.

My first reaction was, \"What crazy people.  Who would behave like this at someone else's wedding?\"<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThen I remembered that at a close friend's wedding reception, the groom's father got into an angry shouting match with the priest who presided, and threatened to drop an ass-kicking on him.

I had eaten a sandwich that someone had picked up for me once before, but this was the first time that I actually went into one of their stores.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThere were three registers open, and only one customer at the counter.  I stayed back to look up at the menu, since I didn't know what they offered.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n\r\n<!--more--><br \/><br \/>I felt the laser-eyes of the empty registered women boring into my torso.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe split second that I lowered my gaze from the menu, they both offered to take my order.  <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nOn my left, there was an old lady who was tall and pleasant looking.  She had white hair and hunched shoulders -- perhaps osteoperosis, perhaps trying not to look so tall.  She was the only one in a white shirt, which I suppose flags her as the manager.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nTo the right was a young woman, who also looked friendly.  I went to her counter.  She took my order, and there was a pause while we waited for our food.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nIn my mind (and only in my mind), we had the following conversation:<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nMe (a little too loudly):  So who's the boss around here?<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nGirl:  Um... she is.  (Indicating the older woman.)<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nMe:  Is she MEAN?

I sure wouldn't want to work for her.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThen I just looked at the girl silently, leaving her with the unenviable choice of contridicting the maniac in her face, or insulting her boss, who by this time would only be pretending not to listen.<br \/>\r\n<br \/><br \/><br \/>\r\nSo now I've lost the \"I've never eaten at Chick-Fil-A\" shock that I used to be able to give people.  The level of astonishment about that fact always seemed out of proportion to me.  It's like I said I've never flown on an airplane.  Or like I said I've never been inside a post office.  Or like I said I've never pooped behind a Texaco when the bathroom door was locked and I couldn't wait any longer.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI get a similar reaction about some movies that I've never seen.  Off the top of my head, here are the ones that make people gasp when they find out I haven't seen them:<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<ul><li>The Karate Kid<\/li><li>Footloose<\/li><li>There's Something About Mary<\/li><li>The Matrix<\/li><li>Gladiator<\/li><\/ul><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nIn most of these cases, I started to watch but fell asleep.  I can sleep through a movie like nobody's business.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI used to consistently get a nap at the Seigen movie theater in Baton Rouge.  Three or four times in a row I went there, watched a little bit of the show, had a nap, and then watched the end.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nWhen we went to see <i>Shine<\/i> I watched the beginning, where Geoffery Rush was sane.  I dozed off, and when I woke up, he was crazy.  I never did find out what made him go crazy.  <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nWhen I asked Mrs. theskinnyonbenny, she just got annoyed and said, \"You should have stayed awake if you wanted to know what happened in the movie.\"\r\n"

It was miserable, but at least I wasn't in costume.  The best I saw was a guy in a white body suit, with purple and gold tiger stripes dyed into the fabric.  He accessorized with cowboy boots, a holster, with whisky bottles in place of sidearms, and a ten gallon hat.  Very stylish.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThere were some people with a couple of giant poodles with \"LSU\" and \"Tigers\" shaved into their fur.  I guess if you're going to subject your dog to the indignity of a creative shaving, it might as well be a giant poodle.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe Tennessee fans were scarce, and I missed the opportunity to trade mean-spirited barbs with strangers from across the country.  At one point, I turned my venom on a guy in turquoise for the offense not wearing colors that reveal his affiliation to either team in the game that day.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI found nothing hypocritical about the fact that I did this in a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.theskinnyonbenny.com\/blog\/archives\/00000065.php\">blue hat<\/a>.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nSpeaking of that blue hat, I came across an interesting theory on the cumulation of superstition that solves the multi-superstition conundrum.  The conundrum arises because there are thousands of fans, each with their own superstitions.  For a given game, some follow their superstitions and some don't.  So whose superstitions actually drive the outcome of the game?<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI have gone through life treating this question the way you have to treat movies about time travel:  don't think about it too hard, or you start to realize how stupid it all is.  But on the other hand, you know that LSU always loses when you don't wear that damned hat, so you dare not leave it home.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nBut a fan quoted in the book <i><a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/exec\/obidos\/tg\/detail\/-\/0609807137\/qid=1127874792\/sr=8-1\/ref=pd_bbs_1\/103-8847902-5949450?v=glance&s=books&n=507846\" target=\"_blank\">Rammer Jammer Yellow Hammer<\/a><\/i> has it all figured out.  Your team's fans have all of their thousands of superstitions, and their teams fans all of their superstitions.  Whichever group is more devout is the winner.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nCome to think of it, I think I threw my sweat-soaked hat in the back of the Jeep before the game was over.  No championship this year.  My bad.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI was pretty bummed about the loss on Monday night.  But today, it didn't seem all that dire.  But if listening to talk radio in Baton Rouge is an accurate gage, then I'm clearly in the minority.  In fact, some fans have family members raped and tortured before their very eyes when LSUs defense tires early.  Or so you would believe if you listen to these callers.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI understand why they get angry, but not why they get that ridiculously angry.  What's the worst thing that could happen?  Les Miles's teams play roughly like Curly Hallman's?<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nSo what?<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nAt least there was plenty of room for asses in the bleachers, and the tickets were cheap.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nLet me leave you with one simple thought.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n2003 National Champs!\r\n"

The sit-down toilet in the men's room was jammed into a corner due to lack of space.  They had a makeshift stall around it, and that stall had a little, angled door.  But the door was hung in a way so that the bottom of the door would come to about mid-chest as you sat on the can.

But I have been inspired by him.  Since my first attempt (which I like to call the \"gleeful ass\" haiku), I've started keeping a haiku journal, which I think is the most fabulous thing in the world.  It's short and quick - just one haiku a day - so it's totally manageable, unlike a regular journal.  It forces you to be concise, picking only one event from each day to memorialize.  And it ends up being a real journal of interesting things that I actually want to remember (vs. I had an important meeting at work today. I was on a power trip because I was wearing really tall heels.  I introduced a great design idea.  Blah blah blah-blah-blah.).<br \/>\n<br \/>\nI highly recommend it.  It's therapeutic.  It's easy to do.  It forces creativity.  As soon as I figure out how to set up a blog, I'm doing it so we can all participate in haiku therapy together.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nSome sample entries of my own:<br \/>\n<br \/>\nMay 4, 2005<br \/>\n<br \/>\nSweet jesus.

Say it out loud right now.  I dare you not to laugh.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nAnyway, we have a lot of catching up to do.  This will be a long post.\r\n<!--more--><br \/><br \/><table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 border=0 align=right><tr><td width=5 rowspan=2><spacer type=block width=5 height=1><\/spacer><\/td><td><img src=\"\/img\/planters.jpg\"  aborder=0 vspace=4\/><\/td><\/tr><tr><td width=275><font face=\"verdana, arial, geneva\" size=1 color=#666666><b>Our new back yard planter boxes.<\/b><\/font><\/td><\/tr><\/table><br \/>\r\n<div><br \/>\r\nAbout the time that I quit posting, we were finishing up this year's big improvement project.  I built these monstrous planter boxes in the back yard.  We aren't too happy with the color, but consider that I spent two weekends and even took a day off work to try to get the colors right.  And this was after several weekends of hauling dirt, rocks, gravel, bricks, and concrete blocks back and forth from the driveway.  <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nAnd, oh yeah, it was August.  <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nA lesser person would have let nature take its course and actually combusted.  I felt my skin starting to rip into flame a couple of times, but I managed to beat out the fire before it did any bodily damage.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe only part of these that I didn't do myself was to grade the ground underneath and pour that concrete.  We hired a crew to come do that one day, and they did okay with it.  The posts aren't exactly square with each other, but they'll do.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe evening after they left, I walked through the driveway and noticed two empty beer bottles in the trash can.  Normally, this isn't unusual, but the trash had just gone out that morning, and I hadn't yet been home to drink any beer.  I have to conclude that a couple of the workers just helped themselves to a couple of beers out of the garage refrigerator at some point in the afternoon.  Good think that I don't keep my gold bullion in the garage refrigerator.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI finished putting the water seal on the lumber the day before the hurricane hit.  How naive we were, in hindsight.  I just posted <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"window.open('\/pg2.php?spgmGal=Hurricane%20Katrina','HurricaneKatrina','width=625, height=768, toolbar=no, location = no, directories=no, menubar=no, resizable=yes, scrollbars=no');\" onmouseover=\"chgImg ('iHurricaneKatrina','imgHurricaneKatrinaRed');\" onmouseout=\"chgImg ('iHurricaneKatrina','imgHurricaneKatrina');\" >this photo gallery<\/a> of shots I took when I check out my parents' house in Slidell.  Who would have guessed that the people of New Orleans would be displaced for so long?<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<i>Velvet Elvis<\/i> doesn't look as good any more as she did when I took these photos.  In retrospect, I shouldn't have pushed her back in the water.  Being flooded, she listed side to side as the weight of the water moved around in the cabin.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nSomewhere in the past two weeks, she rolled to one side, took on more water, and found a stable position laying halfway under water at a 90 degree angle to where she should be.  Crap.  <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe insurance company won't let me do anything until their adjuster gets to me, and I can't get a return call from the adjuster.  If you have the time, I would appreciate if you call Midway Appraisal Services at 985-542-6998.  Let them know that they need to return my calls, and that it's important to you.  Make up a reason for its importance to you. <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nOn the up side, this leads us to a season with a lot more Baton Rouge action.  We know that we're getting a few Saints games here.  It looks good that we will get the Sugar Bowl in January.  If we're lucky, we might get some Hornets games too.  (But to be honest, I don't see why the Hornets won't be able to play at their normal arena.  Especially late in the season.)<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nYou might think it's been nice to see the Saints and Tigers take the role as the national darlings for the past couple of weeks, but I can't say that it's really been a good thing.  Playing your home games at the other guy's home field doesn't change the fact that they have the crowd with them.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nSaturday will be our first LSU home game.  It is going to be one of the biggest, craziest tailgates in the history of campus.  Consider all of the circumstances:<br \/>\r\n<br \/><ul><li>The first home game is at the end of September, after we've been watching football on TV for three weeks.<\/li><br \/><li>This is the first home game for a brand new head coach.<\/li><br \/><li>This is the first home game in a long time where both teams are ranked in the top 10.  It's the ESPN Game Day game this week, making a good argument that this is the biggest game of the day Saturday.<\/li><br \/><li>It's a night game.  Longer tailgate party = better crowd for the Tigers at kickoff.<\/li><br \/><li>It's the first time that the fans get to cheer for the team's effort and for LSU's role in Hurricane relief.  It's the first time that we get to rally for our state all together in person. <\/li><\/ul><br \/>\r\n<\/div><br \/>\r\n<div><center><table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 border=0 align=center><tr><td width=5 rowspan=2><spacer type=block width=5 height=1><\/spacer><\/td><td><img src=\"\/img\/TailgateMap.jpg\"  aborder=0 vspace=4\/><\/td><\/tr><tr><td width=275><font face=\"verdana, arial, geneva\" size=1 color=#666666><b>Here's the map to the tailgate party this weekend.

Just cooler) and less humid weather.  Mid-September is still roasting hot around here, but our forecast should give us some hope for relief.  So far, there's none.  The RealFeel temp is 100 degrees right now.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nBoiling hot September reminds me of a story.  I was in a wedding one year, which happened to coincide with my birthday weekend and the LSU\/Auburn game.  It was a typically sweltering day, and the reception was outside.  <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI think that everyone had a deadline to sneak away and listen to the game, and so they chowed down heavily right at the beginning of the reception.  By the time the wedding party pictures were over, the only food left were devled eggs.  <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI might have been the only one with the nerve to eat eggs which were warmed to a piping hot temperature by nothing more than the evening air temperature.  Hey, I was hungry.  And I didn't get sick, but perhaps they caused a little brain damage, and perhaps that's why you're subjected to the lengthy ramble that is this post.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nAs if anyone will ever read this far anyway.<\/div>\r\n"

And other than mentioning that I still have no electricity, I won't complain today.

If you have your own story to share, please <a href=\"mailto:bens@theskinnyonbenny.com\">email me<\/a>, and I'll pass it on.\r\n<!--more--><br \/><br \/>But first, let me mention that there is a small arena at LSU that gets used for livestock shows, garden shows, and the occasional rodeo.  Now, it is set up as a shelter for all of the animals that people took on their evacuation but aren't allowed to keep wherever they are staying.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nWe went by there last night to take a stack of old newspapers.  It was nice.  The animals are taken care of by Veterinary students, and they are let out to play on the arena floor.  If you're in Baton Rouge and have the time, drop by with your leftover dog food, newspapers, bowls, kennels, or just by the students lunch.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nOn to our stories.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThis one was from a news broadcast.  A mass of people were waiting to be evacuated from New Orleans to Baton Rouge, and the reporter found a woman who had been picked up without as much as a pair of shoes.  A man that she didn't know had given her his shoes, and the reporter thought he would make a good interview.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nReporter:  <i>Sir, why would you give your own shoes to a total stranger?<\/i><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nMan:  <i>It wasn't no big deal.

She was dressed in jeans, and had hair up and little makeup.

All three happen to be nuns.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe man of the house walked into the bathroom to find their nun bras hanging on the accessories all over the bathroom.  This shook him up, and he mentioned it to his wife.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n\"There are nun bras all over the bathroom.\"<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n\"Well, your daughters used to leave their bras all around, and that didn't bother you.\"<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n\"Yeah, but these are nun bras.\"<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI asked about what makes a bra a \"nun bra.\"  Apparently, they don't have any laces or frilly parts.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<center><img src=\"\/img\/greenline.gif\"\/><\/center><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI saved the best story for last, and I promise that this isn't made up.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI know a couple who are both in their 70s.  For the hurricane, they went to stay at their son's house.  Their son is in the same city where they live, so it's safe to say that they had rarely -- if ever -- spent the night there before.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nIn the middle of the night, the husband woke up.  He heard something beep.  Just a single, quick \"beep.\"  A minute or two later, there was another beep.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nHe woke up his wife.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n\"Do you hear something beeping?\"<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nShe listened.  Nothing.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n\"No.\"<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nHe thought about it for a second, and then said, \"It must be in my head!  Put your ear up to my head and see if you hear it.\"<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nLet me just say that the wife has enough sense to know that her husband's brains didn't suddenly start making noises.  But, she had just been woken up and was groggy.  And besides, she probably knew that she would never get to go back to sleep until she listened to his skull.  So, she put her ear up to his head.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nCoincidentally, the alarm system (or smoke detector or whatever it was) chirped again.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n\"Did you hear it?\"<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n\"Yes, I heard it that time.\"<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nWhile the wife slept the rest of the night, the husband layed awake and tried to determine why his melon could be beeping.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nHe got up the next morning and tried to convince the rest of his family that the VA hospital had implanted some sort of gadget in his head the last time he was in for a checkup.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe family was unable to listen to his story with faces straight.\r\n"

Here are some notes I've made about what's happening from here.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<b>Sunday, August 28:<\/b><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nMrs. theskinnyonbenny woke up with an excitement that I haven't seen in weeks.  I don't think anyone enjoys a hurricane party followed by a good storm more than she does.  <br \/>\r\n\r\n<!--more--><br \/><br \/>I spent the day water sealing the new planter boxes that I built.  The weather was beautiful during the day.  The sky was clear, but there was a good breeze.  After water sealing, I fixed the outdoor speakers.  Mrs. theskinnyonbenny and two of our friends filed in through the day with ice, food, and liquor.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nIn the evening, we turned on the weather channel, and started the grill.  We had six people outside.  I have to brag that I made some kick-ass hot dogs.  But I was pretty exhausted, and not really in the spirit.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nAt 9:00 PM, we got a sudden downpour, and that broke up the party.  We put all of the outside things in the garage, and shut down just in time for the rain to stop.  We kept watching storm coverage, which was littered with the words \"catastrophic\" and \"devastation.\"<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nStupid quote number 12:  <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nLouisiana Governor Kathleen Blanco:  <i>\"We have lots of trees in Louisiana.  They make our state very beautiful, but the falling branches cause power lines to come down.\"<\/i>  <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nStupid quote number 14: <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nGeorge Sells, Baton Rouge anchorman to young female CBS reporter:<i>Let me ask you a <\/i>(stumbles for word) <i>... a female question<\/i>.  The reporter starts to look a bit skeptical.  <i>When you are out covering a storm, what do you do about your hair?<\/i><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nHonest to God, I didn't make that up.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nAt midnight I got a rude wakeup from Mrs. theskinnyonbenny.  We had four people in the house, along with four cats and five dogs.  Due to cat allergies, people had to be rearranged, and I got booted to the spare room.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<b>Monday, August 29<\/b><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI spent the night with frequent wakeups caused by cats getting in my face.  We had power, but the room was pitch dark.  Finally, I got out of bed and wandered around looking for a clock.   All were reset due to a power flicker.  Finally I found one.  It was before 6:00.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI looked for a TV that wouldn't disturb any of the sleepers, and checked the weather.  The storm was just coming on shore.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nOver the course of the morning, the wind got stronger and stronger.  There wasn't too much rain, and the wind was interesting, but not causing any damage.  At 10:00, I went back down for a nap.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nWhen I woke up at noon, the wind was about the same.  Power had gone out too.  I read the Sunday paper and had a coke.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nA couple of hours later, the storm had died down enough to go check out the neighborhood.  There were a couple of big trees down, but nothing too serious.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI started our generator and put charcoal in the grill.  We got the TV started and started looking at helicopter flyovers.  <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe dogs ran each other ragged all day, and settled down, unable to keep their eyes open.  It's good to be a dog during a disaster.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nPower came back on, and we enjoyed air conditioning through the night.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<b>Tuesday, August 30<\/b><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nMrs. theskinnyonbenny and I went back to work.  Work life in Baton Rouge is sort of normal, but all conversation has to do with the storm and its aftermath.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe reports from Slidell aren't very good.  There's an interstate span right by our marina that is demolished.  Reports are that most of the town has been destroyed.  But a helicopter flyover shows that houses are still where they should be, and a later report says that the Eden Isles subdivision just got 3-4 feet of flooding.  <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThere's only a slim chance that small little <a href=\"\/ve\/ve_home.php\">Velvet Elvis<\/a> survived the storm, but it's a strong little boat, and stranger things occur.  Those among you who gamble might want to start a pool.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nIt turns out that things are getting worse rather than better for New Orleans.  A levee is breached, and the flood waters are rising.  <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe attitude in Baton Rouge is kind of grim, and kind of incredulous.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe after-work realization is that the cable is still out, the electricity is back out, and the dogs tore a small truckload of dirt out of my new boxes and spread it around my previously-clean patio.  This storm has gone from an exciting adventure to a sucky experience.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 border=0 align=right><tr><td width=5 rowspan=2><spacer type=block width=5 height=1><\/spacer><\/td><td width=275><img src=\"\/img\/neworleansguy.jpg\" aborder=0 vspace=4 wwidth=250\/><\/td><\/tr><tr><td width=275><font face=\"verdana, arial, geneva\" size=1 color=#666666><b>This looter takes home some beer to go with his new wardrobe (which is water ruined), TV (which has no power to run it), and automobile (which is water-ruined).<\/b><\/font><\/td><\/tr><\/table><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nBut not as sucky for me as for those who have to hear about the water rising over their houses in New Orleans.  I was riding with Shelly, and heard a report forecasting eight foot flood waters.  I guess I should label this comment...<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nStupid quote #52:<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nEd Buggs:  <i>...expecting 8 feet of water uptown.<\/i><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nEd Buggs' sidekick:  Moogley Googley<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nYes, he actually expressed his dismay with the phrase \"Moogley Googley.\"  If I had known where their studios were, Shelly would have driven down and beat the tar out of the guy.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nWe went down to the field house at LSU, an indoor track arena that they are using to evacuate sick people.  It was a pretty sobering experience.  They are mostly old and handicapped people who have nowhere to go, no one to care for them, and are relegated to medical care in a gymnasium from volunteer medical students.  If you're in a position to read this blog, consider your blessings.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nMy take on the looters:  if they're stealing food, then let them.  They have to try to live, and the food is just going to go bad anyway.  If they're stealing stuff from people's homes, just shoot them.  After a few of them get shot, the looting should slow down quite a bit.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<b>Today<\/b><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nAnother morning at work goes pretty quietly, and as normally as possible.  I realize another reason to feel blessed:  I don't have to spend a month with ____ evacuated at my house.  (I won't fill in the blank in case this gets back to him\/her).<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nTraffic at lunch today was miserable.  The city is full of refugees.  It's going to be a long, difficult couple of months.\r\n"

Shouldn't paragraph 1.1 and paragraph 1.10 be the same thing?  1.1 is the same number as 1.10.  Similarly, paragraphs 1.11, 1.12, etc. should all come <i>before<\/i> paragraph 1.2.  It's just basic math.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nSometimes, you even get more decimals.  As in paragraph 2.6.4.  I've even seen them go to 2.6.4.1.  These aren't even numbers.\n<!--more--><br \/><br \/>Have we become too stupid in society to just read straight narrative text?  Obviously, you aren't that stupid if you've read this far.  Are you insulted when an author thinks that you won't comprehend his logic if his paragraphs aren't numbered for you?<br \/>\n<br \/>\nI am.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nI received a document from one of my client's other vendors last week.  The document was labeled \"version 0.1.\"  Why on earth would you start with a version number that was less than one?  They might as well just print a little statement like this on the cover page:<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<blockquote>We didn't really try very hard to put meaningful content into this document.  We just whipped it out as quickly as we could, because the client was bugging us and we had already missed our first deadline for this document.  Nevertheless, documenting this requirement is less important to us than putting out the fires cause by our previous lack of documentation, so we decided to half-ass this one.<\/blockquote><br \/>\n<br \/>\nOf course, you can't put that sort of statement, so it's just indicated by \"version 0.1.\"  At least they gave it the one tenth.  I suppose that they could have just started with version zero.<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<br \/>\nI noticed another term used in business meetings that has completely abandoned its original mathematical meaning.  In meetings, when you refer to the \"lowest common denominator\" when comparing things, it generally means of all of those things, the one whose comparison is crappiest.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nFor example, we were working on matching up how different systems store international address fields.  The one with the \"lowest common denominator\" was the one with only a single address line, and nowhere to indicate which country the address was in.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nIn math, the lowest common denominator would be the lowest number that includes all of the factors of the numbers being compared.  For example, the lowest common denominator of 4 and 6 is 12, since 4 and 6 both divide evenly by 12.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nThis is almost the opposite of the business meeting definition.  For the business meeting jargon, it means the one with the fewest features.  In math, it will usually be a number greater than all of the numbers being compared (12 is greater than 4 and 6).  <br \/>\n<br \/>\nI therefore proclaim that the use of \"least common denominator\" to refer to the crappiest of the comparison group is babble.  There are plenty of synonyms that actually do mean \"crappiest.\"  Those should be used instead.\n"

You know, just like the original MTV, but almost 20 years later.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nFor one of their early years, they started playing all of the videos in the MTV library in alphabetical order by song.  They started at the turn of the new year, and the drill lasted all the way into May.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThat made for a fun game.  Guess what the next song would be, and wait around to see how many in-between songs that you had totally forgotten.  It would often be dozens.  It was also interesting to see how many versions of a particular song they had.  And, of course, there was lots and lots and lots of crap that you never heard of in the first place.\r\n<!--more--><br \/><br \/>This year, I started playing the songs on my ipod alphabetically.  Not every time I listen, but every time that I can't decide what to listen to, I just pick up where I left off on the list.  I've worked through all of the songs that start with punctuation or numbers, and I'm well into the A's.  That doesn't seem like much, but it's a couple hundred songs in.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI notice that there are some trends:  songs that start with an apostrophe or parentheses are more likely to be jazz or swing.  There are seventeen songs that start with \"Ain't,\" and almost all of them are 60s R&B.  There are six totally different songs called \"Angel\" and six more that start with \"Angel\" and are then followed by more words.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nInteresting, huh?<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nIt's going to be a rough month when I get to the section where songs start with \"Cowboy.\"<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nBut I digress.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nYesterday, I got to the songs that start with the words \"America\" or \"American.\"  I was expecting some pretty cheesy country music in that stretch, but look what I got:<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<i>Neil Diamond's \"America\":<\/i>  There's the cheese I expected, but you can't help but like this one.  After this, I got a handful of fairly lame songs from Yes, Morrissey, the Cult, and Garth Brooks.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<i>Green Day's \"American Idiot:\"<\/i>  I've been playing it for almost a year, and I'm not tired of it yet.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<i>The Violent Femmes \"American Music\":<\/i>  This is a fantastic song.  Just great.  I listened to it three times back to back before moving on to....<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<i>A whole collection of \"American Pie\" versions.<\/i>  It wasn't a surprise to have multiple versions of this one.  I remember when the Madonna remake came out listening to Mrs. theskinnyonbenny argue with one of her friends about whether it was any good.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nMrs. theskinnyonbenny is a big fan of Madonna and liked the song.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe friend was one of those with some level of disgust for a modern update of a rock and roll classic.  \"She probably doesn't even know what that song is about,\" she claimed.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n\"Yeah.  She probably thinks it's about pie.\" (That was my only contribution to the conversation.)<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nBut what really caught my attention and made this whole thing blogworthy, was this version.  I don't remember hearing this before, and it definitely caught me by surprise.  It's a cover by the Brady Bunch, and to save you the pain of trying to find the version for yourself, I've made it so you can play the tune for yourself right here.  <embed NAME=\"nsplay\" PLUGINSPAGE=\"http:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/windows\/mediaplayer\/download\/default.asp\" SRC=\"\/sound\/AmericanPie.mp3\" TYPE=\"video\/x-ms-wmf-plugin\"  AUTOSTART=\"0\" SHOWCONTROLS=\"1\"  align=\"right\" \/><noembed>You'll have to find this song somewhere else.

On second thought, I can't narrow it down to three.  Here are my favorite four.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<b>4.  Meat<\/b><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe president of our company wanted Date Rape Dan to start writing the release announcements for new software.  In the past, he had always done that job himself, and the company was big enough that it really should have been something that he could delegate.  However, he didn't trust the engineers who understood the release to put enough sales spin into it, and he couldn't trust the sales organization to understand the features.  <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nHe called a meeting with Date Rape Dan, a marketing subordinate, and several of the developers.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe president prefaced the meeting by explaining that he wanted to \"take the meat of each new feature\" and turn it into a marketing slick.  We then started to go bullet point by bullet point through each new feature.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nFor each item, a developer would explain what the feature was and give some information about why it was beneficial.  Date Rape Dan and the marketing guy would take notes, restate what they thought they heard, and look to the president for approval.  Every time the president nodded that he got it right (which sometimes took several attempts), Date Rape Dan would chime in with, \"All right, that's some good meat on this one.\"<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n(I'm not paraphrasing.  That really is exactly how he said it.)<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThis meeting went for a few hours a day for several days in a row.  The routine never varied.  Finally, on day three, the president got worried and asked, \"Dan, you're not actually going to put the word <i>meat<\/i> in the release announcement, are you?\"<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nDate Rape Dan assured him that he wasn't, but continued to overuse the word \"meat\" for several weeks.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<b>3.  Chicago<\/b><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nWe were waiting for the programming to be completed for some long-forgotten custom deliverable.  The programmer doing the coding was (and still is) named Chikako.  It's pronounced just like it's spelled.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nDate Rape Dan asked the status and was told, \"we're waiting on Chikako.\"<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nChikako was integrating some software that had been provided by another vendor.  I don't recall where that vendor was located, but I know that it was not Chicago.  Regardless, Dan assumed that the other vendor was in Chicago and that we were waiting on that vendor.  He called and chewed them out, even though they had provided their software weeks before.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<b>2.  Where'd You Get That Ice Cream<\/b><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nWhen Date Rape Dan was new to the company, he went to lunch with one of his employees.  He asked about the process for something or other.  The guy started explaining the process.  He went on for several minutes.  Date Rape Dan would nod and without saying anything, encourage him to elaborate.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nAt the end of the long explanation, Date Rape Dan paused as if in thought.  He then looked up and asked his only question about the process:  \"Where'd you get that ice cream?\"<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<b>1.  Investor Meeting<\/b><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nIn the technology investment capital boom of the 90s, our company executives made their pitch to a number of investors.  They were trying to raise capital in order to implement an aggressive growth plan.  It was a huge step in moving from a small company to a serious force in our market.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nDate Rape Dan was, of course, part of these meetings.  I, of course, was not at something this important, but I suppose that he was to present the sales plan to the capital investors.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI'm sure the presentations got boring, but Date Rape Dan couldn't get it in his head that these were significantly important presentations to his career.  <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nIn one meeting, he got bored, so he picked up a discarded candy or gum wrapper from the table.  He put it in front of his mouth, stretched it tight with both hands, and blew.  The wrapper started to buzz\/whistle, and Date Rape Dan made it whistle out a little rhythm.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nMeanwhile, someone was in front of the room trying to speak, and his nasty glares couldn't distract Date Rape Dan from his candy wrapper melody.  His employee sitting next to him had to give him a sharp elbow to the ribs to get him to knock it off.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nDate Rape Dan's career at our company didn't last much longer.<br \/>\r\n<br \/><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nFor the last several years, Date Rape Dan has held an important position in the Louisiana state government.  He runs a group of people whose role is to attact technology companies to come to Louisiana and to help the ones in the state grow.  Good luck, Louisiana.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n\r\n"

		"post_content" : "The new Whole Foods store in our area opened on Wednesday of this week, and being the diligent reporter of what's happening locally, I joined about seventy thousand other Baton Rougans to see how it was.  To be honest, there's nothing substantive to share.  It's just a big store with a good but expensive selection of produce, meat, and cheese, not to mention a highly diverse selection of olives and nuts.\r\n<!--more--><br \/><br \/>It does remind me that I have some fauxlogna (my word for fake, soy based bologna) in my fridge.  Fauxlogna is a suitable substitute for bologna on a sandwich, where you have at least cheese, bread, and mayonnaise to camouflage its natural flavor.  <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nAs a solo food, it is not nearly as appealing.  First of all, it is pretty much brown instead of pink.  I know that's because it isn't full of dye, but it is still pretty ugly to look at.  <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nSecond of all, it stinks to high heaven.  I don't know what they do to make it taste sort of like real bologna, but it doesn't leave a pleasant aroma in its stead.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 border=0 align=right><tr><td width=5 rowspan=2><spacer type=block width=5 height=1><\/spacer><\/td><td width=275><img src=\"\/img\/fauxlogna.jpg\" aborder=0 vspace=4 wwidth=250\/><\/td><\/tr><tr><td width=275><font face=\"verdana, arial, geneva\" size=1 color=#666666><b>Brown fauxlogna, next to pink ham on my kitchen counter.<\/b><\/font><\/td><\/tr><\/table><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nBut heck, real bologna doesn't smell all that great either.  From what part of a cow or pig does the \"bologna\" cut come?  Could I even go to a butcher and ask for a bologna?<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nOf course the answer to that second question is no.  Bologna isn't real meat.  We all suspect that the process at the Oscar Mayer plant is something like this:<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<ol><li>Take the lips and brains and other byproducts from making real meat, and put them into a giant blender.<br \/><br \/><\/li><li>Turn on the blender, and add water and a mix of chemicals.  Mix until you have a giant tub of slurry.<br \/><br \/><\/li><li>Pour the slurry into thin, perfectly round molds.<br \/><br \/><\/li><li>Heat, chill, or let the chemical reactions happen, until the bologna slices are solid.<br \/><br \/><\/li><li>Put in packages.<\/li><\/ol><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThis is one of the reasons that I started eating fauxlogna.  I know that most people don't even think about these things while they eat, but sometimes the content of your food gives you a startling reminder.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nA few years ago, we had a family reunion in North Louisiana.  We grilled hot dogs for lunch.  The dogs came in a big cardboard box of a zillion for six dollars.  I had a couple.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nSomewhere in the middle of my second hot dog, I bit down on a bone chip.  It wasn't a broken tooth, it was a bone left over from the original cow or pig.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nFor dinner, a local barbecue place brought sausage, chicken, beans, and potato salad.  You won't believe this, but halfway into a sausage link, I hit another piece of bone.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nIf you're getting pieces of bone in your meat, then you know you're also getting the tendons and ligaments and other tissues that hold muscle and bones together.  If the meat is near the digestive track, then you know the slaughterhouse workers are getting bits of stomach, which leak stomach acid into the food.  Near the intestines, they get pieces of intestine, and sometimes, the semi-digested pre-shit oozes into your food.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nAll of a sudden, fauxlogna doesn't sound quite so bad, does it?<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nBon appetit.<br \/>\r\n\r\n"

It's a folding, cardboard thing from the lobby tables at the International House hotel in New Orleans.  Additional twist:  they were all removed the day after I stole my copy.  Maybe they were new, and they realized that they weren't any good.  Maybe they saw me steal one, so they removed them all until I checked out.  It's hard to say.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nTo be honest, I just noticed the watermark saying, \"One half of all smokers will be killed by their habit.\"  Hey, that's not bad.  Consider that I likely have the chance to smoke for 50 years.  After all of that, there's only a 50\/50 chance that it kills me.

They all take up half of the pack, and the image is printed on both sides of the pack.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThis is, of course, to deter people from buying cigarettes.  I'm not sure if it works.  I'm sure that it helps sell cigarettes to people like me -- who don't smoke, but who would be happy to buy at least one pack with any of their many nasty images, just for the novelty of it.<\/div><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n\r\n"

But I had no sides or top on the Jeep, other than a small rectangle over the driver and passenger seats to keep the sun off me during the day, so I knew I had to hurry home.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nIt's only a five mile drive home, but at mile one, it was dark enough to turn on headlights.  At mile two, it started to rain.  Thirty seconds later, I was in a downpour.\r\n<!--more--><br \/><br \/>Unless you're reading this from Louisiana, Florida, or the Amazon rain forest, my definition is probably different than your definition of \"downpour.\"  In the Louisiana summertime, this means that the water is coming down faster than the street drains can suck it away.  It means that you can stand on one side of a football field and not be able to see the other.  It means that you can get drenched faster than any method that doesn't involve diving.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nWe don't really talk about our downpours too much locally, because they happen just about every day in the summertime.  But they are very isolated.  One spot might get drenched while a lot one mile away stays bone dry.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nSo the water started blowing in.  First, it was a small cold stream on my thigh, but in short order, I was damp from head to foot.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nAnd then something odd happened:  I started to laugh.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nInstead of being annoying, it was unbelievably fun.  The rain felt cold and fresh and clean.  I turned up the radio, and pushed the gas harder.  I sprayed water from my tires up into the air, adding to the monsoon.  By this time, I was laughing like a stoner in front of an <i>Animal House<\/i> rerun.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nAt home, I figured that I would put the cover on, to minimize the soaking seats.  In the few minutes that I was completely outside, I was drenched.  I walked up to the front door, wet pants stuck to my legs.  I splashed barefoot through the puddles.  The rain was cold in the air, but warm in the puddles over previously sizzling concrete.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 border=0 align=right><tr><td width=5 rowspan=2><spacer type=block width=5 height=1><\/spacer><\/td><td><img src=\"\/img\/jeepfloor.jpg\" aborder=0 vspace=4\/><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><font face=\"verdana, arial, geneva\" size=1 color=#666666><b>The puddle on my Jeep Floor this morning.<\/b><\/font><\/td><\/tr><\/table><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nAs I stripped naked inside the front door, I dripped water all over the floor.

(Note to Chrysler Corp:  The drain plugs in the floor of the Jeep are good, but sort of pointless when the carpet is impermeable to water.)<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nBy lunch time, the carpet was damp and the seats were dry.

Up until a year or two ago, I played for a couple of hours one night a week with a group of guys from work.  We all sucked (more or less), but we kept up a regular game for a year or more.  It was something to get outside and do with no distracting computer monitors.<br \/>\r\n\r\n<!--more--><br \/><br \/>The first thing that the pro did was check my grip.  It is how I held a racquet when I was a kid, and how I have held it ever since.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe second thing that he did was to change my grip.  He put my hand around the handle in a way that was completely unnatural.  It was like trying to use scissors left handed.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nIf that wasn't enough, he showed me how I have to hold my wrist at an uncomfortable cocked angle in order for my new grip to put the racquet where it needed to be on my swing.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThen -- with my arm feeling as contorted as an acrobats -- I tried to hit balls.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI sailed them high and I plowed them into the net.  But sometimes, my completly unnatural swing would come together like it was supposed to, and I would hit a low screamer just over the net.  Those were fun.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI didn't expect this, but the pro encouraged me to swing with a lot of oomph, so when I hit one good, it had some zip.  But hitting one good was the rare exception.  When I fell out of my contorted arm position, they sailed high and long.  Several nailed the metal wall in back with a loud gong that would have pleased Chuck Barris.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nWhen we tried to hit backhand, I found that my stiff shoulder muscles had trouble rotating around and across my body.

We went out to a marsh in the middle of nowhere Wednesday evening, and spent the time fishing off the dock, grilling steak, and drinking beer.  On Thursday, we took a guided charter out around barrier islands and caught fish all morning.  It's a good way to spend a day and a half.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nWhen we got out there on Wednesday, we had company on the pier.  There was a older guy and his new wife, who locked their keys in their car in their excitement to catch fish.  There was also a guy with a little coon ass girl, who started running smack as soon as I started fishing.\r\n<!--more--><br \/><br \/><table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 border=0 align=right><tr><td width=5 rowspan=2><spacer type=block width=5 height=1><\/spacer><\/td><td width=275><img src=\"\/img\/EdBeer.jpg\" aborder=0 vspace=4\/><\/td><\/tr><tr><td width=275><font face=\"verdana, arial, geneva\" size=1 color=#666666><b>Eddie drinks beer and cooks steak.<\/b><\/font><\/td><\/tr><\/table><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n(Put that annoying Cajun accent on a little girls voice in your head):  \"What you doing?

It's 10,\" she hollered as she left, meaning that the fish that I was measuring to see if it was big enough to keep (12 inches) was actually only 10 inches.  For the record, it came in at 11 7\/8.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe fish bit well early, but I never caught a keeper on Wednesday night.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nWe fished hard on a warm, sunny Thursday morning.  It took a while to find a spot where there was a consistent bite.  We probably brought up around 40 speckled trout from this one site.  Then, a group of porpoises swam in and broke up the party, running the trout in all different directions.  We ended up with a total of about 75 fish from both Wednesday and Thursday.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 border=0 align=right><tr><td width=5 rowspan=2><spacer type=block width=5 height=1><\/spacer><\/td><td width=200><img src=\"\/img\/SamReeling.jpg\" aborder=0 vspace=4\/><\/td><\/tr><tr><td width=200><font face=\"verdana, arial, geneva\" size=1 color=#666666><b>Sam reels in a giant redfish.<\/b><\/font><\/td><\/tr><\/table><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nOur route home Thursday afternoon brought us through New Orleans.  We had to cross from the west side of the Mississippi to downtown over a bridge that charges a dollar to go in that direction.  Of course, we couldn't come up with a dollar in cash.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI was looking for an ATM on the west side, when my buddy Eddie made an argument to just go try to sweet talk my way through.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n\"You don't think this is the first time someone tried it do you?  I bet people show up all the time without their dollar.  People just forget.  And they can't make you back down the bridge.  What can they do, other than just let you off?\"<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nIt sounded like a good plan.  And besides, there were no ATM machines in sight.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI rolled up to the toll booth, gave the lady my most charming smile and the lamest story she had heard in months:  \"I thought I had a bill in my wallet, but someone must have borrowed it.\"  I offered to write an IOU, or to give her a one-dollar check.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nUnfortunately, I picked a booth operated by a bitch.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nShe told me that I would have to turn down a little lane right past the toll booths, go back to the west side, and get money.  I started to roll forward, and she yelled at me because I wasn't supposed to go until she had all of the other traffic stopped so that I could get to my loser lane.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nSo they really do have this little lane that loops you off of the bridge and back to where you came from.  Who would have thought.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nAfter I went to the ATM machine, I was tempted to go back to the same toll troll.  <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n\"I still don't have a dollar.  Would you take a ziplock of speckled trout?\"<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nUnfortunately, the lane I came in on made it tough to get back to that same toll lane.  Besides, I was getting to tired to mess with that woman, as fun as it would have been.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nWe got to Eddie's house, and we dropped him off and unloaded all of his gear, with the exception of his keys.  He came by the office on Friday to pick up the keys.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe lady at the front desk called:  \"There is an 'Eddie' here to see you.\"<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nMe:  \"Tell that loser to take a hike.  I've got no use for him.\"<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nAbout 15 seconds of uncomfortable silence followed.  Then, she just hung up without saying another word.  I was apparently on a low-volume speaker phone, and the lady at the desk didn't know what else to do.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI walked outside with Ed to share a laugh at my obnoxious behavior.  Then, he told me something I would rather have not known:  he had a dollar in his wallet the whole time.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n\r\n"

Its rigged with some rudimentary luxuries like fans and a built in beer cooler.  One of the last additions was a TV, mounted up high.  It is the perfect place to watch a game.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nUnfortunately, LSU is oh-for when someone watches them play out there.  And unlike the good luck talisman (my old hat), it seems to apply across sports.  A quick rundown:<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<ul><li>Football:  LSU gets clobbered by Georgia for their first loss of the season.<\/li><li>Football:  LSU loses a close game against Auburn that they should have won.  I go outside to watch the end of the game at the beagle, costing LSU the win.<\/li><li>Football:  After avioding watching the tigers outside for the rest of the season, my Mom turns on the Citrus Bowl out there on New Years day.  New Years day is often a rough one for me, and I had to take a nap at halftime.  I intended to get up and shoo her out of there once the game started, but I only woke up in time to see LSU lose the game on the last play.<\/li><li>Basketball:  I watched one regular season basketball loss out there all by myself.<\/li><li>Basketball:  A yard full of people were there for a crawfish boil as LSU got eliminated from the SEC tournament in a good game.<\/li><li>Women's basketball:  I went home at lunch and watched LSU give up a huge lead to Alabama during the SEC tournament.  Went back to work, and LSU pulled ahead and won.<\/li><li>Baseball:  Rice beats LSU Saturday night while we cooked out.<\/li><\/ul><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI'm not slanting the story, either.  I have never watched the Tigers win anything from my back yard.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nSummer is always rough as far as sports to watch.  I can't seem to get interested in car races.  I can nap to golf tournaments, but don't really want to watch one hour after hour.  Major League Baseball is a snooze, and I don't have a team to pull for in those meaningless regular season games anyway.  If Miami and Phoenix had made the NBA finals, I would watch those games, but for San Antonio and Detriot, I'll take the highlights only, please.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThat leaves me with Wimbledon and the Tour de France as the only events where I have a passing interest.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nIt's going to be a long, hot summer.\r\n"

By the time I finally see those, you will have long since formed an opinion for yourself.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n\r\n<!--more--><br \/><br \/>But I do end up going to an inordinate number of movies that no one has heard of, much less knows that they're actually showing in a Baton Rouge theater.  Most of these pay at the Seigen Lane theater, and often, there's no more than a person or two in the movies other than my group.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nSo, has anyone else not heard of <i>Kung Fu Hustle<\/i>?  I had never heard of it before Mrs. theskinnyonbenny picked it as a rainy holiday pastime yesterday.  She billed it as \"a kung-fu movie spoof.\"<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nBeing unfamiliar with any movies in that particular sub-genre, I was intrigued.  I like a good kung-fu movie.  What I got was a kung-fu movie crossed with a Bugs Bunny cartoon.  And I mean that in the best sort of way.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe basic story is of a Chinese city a long time ago (1930s?  1940s?  Who can say?), where a couple of doofuses draw the big gang in town into a fight with a particular slum, and it turns out that the people in the slum have a little fight in them.  At the very beginning, we get to see the Chinese gangsters do a choreographeddance in the style of the golden age Hollywood musicals, and it's immediately clear that this isn't a dark, vengeful, Tarantino style movie.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe gags are rediculous, but many of them are genuinely funny.  For example, one of the guys who fights for the slum fights with half of his ass hanging out of his britches.  There's also some BennyHillesque fast-motion running around, and an inept bad guy who keeps getting himself hurt.  Good times.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nAnd then there are some above average fights.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nIt's worth sticking this one in your Netflix queue.\r\n"

You could give him a pile of six week old dog turds, and he could dream up a way to get rich -- or at least to make a decent profit -- from said dog turds.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nGuido was a year ahead of me in the Electrical Engineering program at LSU, but he finally found his true calling a year or two ago as a slumlord in New Orleans.  It's a perfect fit.  Where you or I would see a property that should be bulldozed he sees a decent home for poor people.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n\r\n<!--more--><br \/><br \/>(Actually, that last sentence makes him seem a lot more noble than I think he really is, but that's how it came out, so I'll just leave it alone.)<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nAnyway, I had heard second hand about a scheme that he had to get over on the big casinos.  I scoffed.  I don't think Guido is going to fit in with the Asian MIT students in their card counting game.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nTo my surprise, he outlined his idea to me last time we were in Vegas, and perhaps due to the super-oxygenated environment or the liquor, or perhaps because the idea is solid, it started to make sense.  The jist of it is something like this:<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nRoulette wheels are made by men, or by machines made by men.  Suppose the dividers between numbers wasn't <i>exactly<\/i> equal.  Or suppose that the wheel was ever-so-slightly bent.  In case, there would be numbers where over a large enough set of samples would be favored.  And if you played those numbers over and over, you would have good days and bad days, but in the long run, you would come out ahead.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI chalked this up as an interesting intellectual argument and went home thinking nothing more about it.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThis week, I caught a show about a family of Spaniards who had the same idea, and put the theory to work.  They tracked tens of thousands of results on different wheels in European casinos, and then went out every day and played the biases.  They attempted to look like tourists, starting with small bets and working their way up.  They made enough money to get booted from all of the major casinos in Europe.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThen they brought the scheme to Vegas.  They ran the same drill, and they made piles of cash.  Just as the casino security people started to catch on to them, the ringleader collapsed from nerves and exhaustion after an all night roulette binge and luck turned bad.  They retired, but went home with around a million bucks of profit.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe television show didn't answer my biggest question:  how did they track ten thousands spin results without being noticed?  I can see how you would get several hundred, just by walking by and looking at the screen that displays past results, but ten thousand?<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThat's where Guido has them trumped.  He ropes his tenants into going to the New Orleans casinos and writing down numbers that come up.  I have no idea how he knows they aren't screwing him. qxzxx\r\n"

How did they get so fit, but manage to stay fat?<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI don't really know how mother nature lets that happen, but I'm a walking\/peddling laboratory for study of the phenomenon.  I'm at least 15-20 pounds over my ideal weight, and I'm five pounds of pure gut over the heaviest that I've ever been.  (If you've seen me and don't think this could be, then you should see me clad in some tight synthetic cycling gear.  It ain't pretty.)<br \/>\r\n\r\n<!--more--><br \/><br \/>But even so, I'm knocking out my ususal 40 minute rides in 35 minutes.  There's a short hill near my house that I like to sprint up.  My goal has usually been to keep my speed above 14 mph going up, but on my last two rides, I've topped 17.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI guess with another 20 pounds on my belly, I'll be ready to start racing.  Who's bringing the Krispy Kreme's to the office tomorrow?<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI had gotten some new cycling shoes early this year.  The way cycling shoes work nowdays is that they have clips that snap in to a binding on the pedal, similar to a really small ski boot cliping into the ski.  This system is called a \"clipless\" pedal, presumably by a non-English speaking person who didn't know the usual meaning of the suffix \"-less.\"<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThis clipless pedal arrangement allows you to <a href=\"http:\/\/outside.away.com\/outside\/gear\/gearguy\/200505\/20050518.html\" target=\"_blank\">fall sideways<\/a> after coasting to a smooth stop, or in extreme cases, it allows your bicycle to twist your ankle to an unnatural angle, a la Joe Thiesman's knee.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nAnyway, the clips for the bottom of the shoe come with the pedal rather than with the shoe.  My old clips were pretty much rusted to their screws, which were in turn rusted to the old shoes.  So I went and bought some new clips.  Little did I know what an ordeal it would be.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nAn incidental note for Baton Rougeans:  the cycling shop on Florida Boulevard near airline is a fine place to go by dolls, but don't expect to find clips for your shoes there.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nIt turns out that the little screws that connect the clips were just barely too short to reach the sockets for the screws in the bottom of the shoes.  Odd, I thought all of this was standard.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI went back to the shop where I bought the clips.  They just had standard screw sizes -- nothing an eighth of an inch longer.  The guy did a little poking around, and realized that the metal plates in the bottom of the shoes had been put in upside down.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe plates had little volcano shaped flanges that were supposed to reach out of the bottom of the shoe to accept the screws.  Instead, they were pointed up, so that the volcano flanges could dig into the bottom of the foot.  I bet that would feel real good after a three-hour ride.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI went home, and figured out how to get the plates out.  I had to cut the fabric liner at the bottom of the shoe.  The metal was curved to fit the way that a foot flexes, so I had to bend it.  I did my best to make it into the best approximation of that same curve, but facing the other way.  <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThis wasn't a scientific process.  As tools, I used two pairs of pliers, and my eyeballs to measure the curve.  What an ordeal.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nWhen I inserted my re-engineered metal plates and closed up the bottom of the inside of the shoe, the clips went right on.  On one shoe.  The screws for the second shoe were completely lost by this time.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nSo I found myself back at the bike shop, begging for more standard screws.  To make it seem like I wasn't there for a handout, and because I really needed it, I picked up a tire pump to buy when I checked out.  Unfortunately, the shop I chose didn't have any screws.  Yes, it was the shop with the dolls.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nWhen I was almost home, I thought to myself, \"shoot, I didn't buy that pump.\"  I really did need that pump.  I looked behind me, and there was the pump in the back seat.  Stolen.  I was cruising around town with a hot bicycle pump.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI really didn't want to go all the way back to the store just to admit that I had stolen from them.  The devil on one shoulder and the angel on the other had a heated debate as I drove the last few blocks to my house.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nMrs. theskinnyonbenny will be dismayed to learn that the angel won.  I turned around and went back to the store.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nWhen I went in and explain my misdeed, the guy working the store told me, \"Wow, I would have been like, 'I just got a free pump!'\"<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nYeah...um...you're welcome, I guess.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nNow where did you say those Krispy Kremes were?\r\n"

People don't actually word their question like that, but that's what I hear.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI understand that the joy of raising your children outweighs my ability to go to Vegas on a lark, eat dinner at nice restaurants without advance planning, or sitting outside in the silence while catching up on my reading.  However, there are some signs that I might not be the world's best primary caregiver.<br \/>\r\n\r\n<!--more--><br \/><br \/>When Mrs. theskinnyandbenny and I first moved into our house, we had two cats:  Oscar and Felix.  They were nice, normal cats.  I had started feeding them as stray kittens, and at some point, we moved, took them with us, and became responsible for their veternary care.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nOur new house was on a very busy street.  We took pains to keep the two cats inside, so they wouldn't join the legions of roadkill (mostly possums -- don't freak out) that litter our road.  I went as far as to have a cat door installed for the upstairs balcony, so that they could go out there at their leisure.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nHaving prided himself as a good stray, Felix was annoyed with his captivity.  He started urinating on our things to show his displeasure.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nOscar became stressed (presumably about close encounters with someone else's cat piss).  He manifested this stress by getting a hormone imbalance, and starting to lose his fur.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nWe tried drugs.  The vet perscribed an anti-depressant for Felix's anger, and cat birth control pills for Oscar's hormones.  <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n(No shit, there really is such a thing as cat birth control pills.)<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 border=0 align=right><tr><td width=5 rowspan=2><spacer type=block width=5 height=1><\/spacer><\/td><td width=275><img src=\"\/img\/oscarFelix.jpg\" aborder=0 vspace=4\/><\/td><\/tr><tr><td width=275><font face=\"verdana, arial, geneva\" size=1 color=#666666><b><\/b>Felix and Oscar<\/font><\/td><\/tr><\/table><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nAfter the first time I pulled it on him, Felix was too smart to be fooled by the \"nasty pill hidden in the cheese\" ruse.  I started stuffing the pill down his mouth.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nHe was more stubborn than me.  He held the pill as long as I would fight him, and spit it on the ground.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI took to griding the pill into a powder, adding a little water, and using an eye-dropper to administer it to the cat.  Sometimes, I would get the residue on my finger, and the taste was undescribably horrible and bitter.  It made my whole mouth numb, in the same way that cutting off a fingertip makes your hand kind of numb for a little while.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nAfter many months, I realized the crulety of my ways.  Besides, all of this wasn't making the cat any less angry.  We opened the door and let them out.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nLo and behold, a cat that is smart enough to figure out \"nasty pill hidden in the cheese\" is also smart enough to stay out of traffic.  They ran and played happily.  Felix quit peeing in the house.  Oscar got his full coat of hair back.  We lived in harmony for a few years.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nFelix continued to play the role of neighborhood stray.  He ventured out to mark new territory.  But he was friendly and fat and playful.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nAfter a long time, he quit coming home every day.  Then, he disappeared for a week before coming home.  Then, his visits became less and less frequent.  It became clear:  Felix had grown up and moved away.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nFor the last five years or so, Felix has lived around the corner and two houses down from us.  I see him almost every day out in the yard, looking like a meatloaf in the grass.  Although he wears a collar with our phone number, he never comes to visit.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI've never heard of another cat just up and moving to someone else's house like that.  He will tolerate a visit.  Sometimes, he's downright welcoming.  But he isn't coming back to our house.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nSo to summarize, the first time I had two creatures to care for as an adult, I ended up with one on anti-depressants, one on birth control, and then one decide to go live with a neighbor all on his own volition.  Bring on the parenting!\r\n"

I like the thought of \"unintentionally snazzy\" being a phrase to describe me, though.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI think that most men look in the mirror and see an above-average guy looking back at them.  In half the cases (obviously, since we're comparing to average), they are wrong.  In my case, I am oh-so right.\r\n<!--more--><br \/><br \/>Here's a story to illustrate:  A coworker of mine had posted on the wall of her cube, a nice little drawing of her granddaughter.  One week, while she was out of town, I hung a photograph of myself over that drawing.  She left it covering the little girl's picture for a months.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 border=0 align=right><tr><td width=5 rowspan=2><spacer type=block width=5 height=1><\/spacer><\/td><td width=275><img src=\"\/img\/annscube.jpg\" aborder=0 vspace=4\/><\/td><\/tr><tr><td width=275><font face=\"verdana, arial, geneva\" size=1 color=#666666><b>Ann's cube wall, in its current state.

This is high comedy.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nWhile I'm talking about work, I'll mention the departure of Tom the programmer, whose last day is Tuesday.  Tom works closely with Toni, and when I come in early, I can hear them squawking like a married couple from 6:00 to about 8:00.  Once the office starts to fill up with people at 8:00, Tom clams up, and there's no sound from him for the rest of the day.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nTheir bickering is a regular source of amusement for me.  Yesterday, it was over how some information was stored in the database.  I prompted me to email them this haiku:<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<center><b>A Haiku for Toni<\/b><br \/>\r\nThere are no zeros<br \/>Saved there in the database<br \/>Open it and see<\/center><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI know that this really isn't amusing anyone other than me, but sometimes self-amusement is reward enough.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nSince only the real nerds have stuck with me this long, we came up with this joke earlier in the week:<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<center><b>A programmers grocery list<\/b><\/center><blockquote>< ?php include(\"\/home\/users\/web\/b1051\/sl.theskinn\/public_html\/blog\/archives\/include117.txt\"); ?><\/blockquote><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nGetting back to my unintentional snazziness, my next hair do will be a real hum-dinger.

I mentioned in that entry that I didn't have the time or space to detail all of the mean things that I had done to our housemother.  So by request, here is one such story.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nFirst, some background information is necessary.  Our house mother is the first -- and to this day the only -- woman mayor of Baton Rouge.  Her husband had been mayor, and when he died, the city apparently decided to name a park after him (Webb park, right down the road from my house), and panic about the succession plan.  Somehow, they just talked his wife into finishing his term.\r\n<!--more--><br \/><br \/>Of course, that had been a full generation before I ever met Miss Mary.  I have no idea how the intervening decades transformed the mayor of our city into a slightly crazy, chain-smoking house mother who had not a small appreciation for liquor.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nOne night, a few of us rolled in late from a night of bar hopping.  Rolling in very late was often a time when we showed Miss Mary some love.  Usually very noisy, disturbing love.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI don't really remember what led up to this scene, but I can picture it clearly:  The guy who looked like Popeye when he got drunk was standing on the roof of Miss Mary's car.  He was wearing nothing except some tighty-whities and argyle socks.  He faced the front of her car with his dick hanging out, pissing away, laughing like a maniac.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe next night at dinner, Miss Mary explained something strange.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n(Now, you have to do your best to read Miss Mary's quotes in her voice.  It was the voice that you would use to make fun of how an old lady talks.  High pitched, with a drawn out accent, and with a bit of a smoker's rasp.  It was also loud, due to the fact that she didn't hear all that well.)<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n\"<i>There were some strange little marks on my car.  There were marks where it was scratched.  Like something was up there!!<\/i>\"<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n\"Well what do you think it could have been, Miss Mary?\"<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n\"<i>I think it was CATTLE!<\/i>\"<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nWe weren't within five miles of the nearest cow.  It would have been easy to bust out laughing, but we had to know more.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n\"Where do you think cattle might have come from?\"<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n\"<i>I don't know, but those scratches look like hoof marks.  There were CATTLE walking around campus, and they climbed up on my car.<\/i>.\"<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n\"Why would they have just climbed up on your car?\"<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n\"<i>You may not believe me, but I can show you the marks.  There are hoof marks on my car!.<\/i>\"<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nShe was very excited about the whole thing.  I imagined her call to her auto insurance agent:<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n\"<i>Mr. Insurance Man?  Yes...I'd like to report some damage to my car...It seems like some cattle climbed up on top of it....Yes, sir.  Cattle....Well, I don't know where they came from.  It happened during the night....Yes, right here behind the fraternity house....No, I'm sure it was cattle....<\/i>\"<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI'm sure that insurance agent still tells this story all of this time, just like I do.<br \/>\r\n\r\n"

Here's what I did between the time I woke up and the time I went to work.\r\n<!--more--><br \/><br \/><b>2:30 - 3:30:<\/b>  Watched the last hour of OLN's Tour de Georgia broadcast.  <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nOLN condensed a six-day stage race down to a two or three hour broadcast.  I had already watched the first few stages, and I accidentally came ac cross an article that spoiled who won for me, but I watched anyway.  <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThis was a good race.

First, there is absolutely nothing else on during that time of the night.  Second, the shows are unintentionally hilarious.  <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nMy favorite episode had Lassie stuck behind an electric fence.  \"Don't try to jump, girl,\" said the over-acting little kid.  \"You'll be a dead dog for sure!\"<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nAfter five minutes, it dawned on me that I had a better option.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<b>3:35 - 5:35:<\/b>  Last couple of episodes of <i>Arrested Development<\/i>.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI borrowed the first season on DVD, having never caught an episode.

Unfortunately, they both have ratings just north of 2:00 AM Lassie reruns.  I hope the networks keep these shows running.  I have to think that once people get used to the fact that there isn't a laugh track, they will keep watching.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI haven't seen any of season two.  I'm watching for those to start again in reruns.  Let me know if you notice it on your TV guide.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<b>5:35 - 7:00:<\/b>  On the Internet.  <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI got on the Internet because at the end of the cycling broadcast, Phil Liggit implored me to go to oln.com and let them know whether I would like to see live Tour de Georgia coverage next year.  <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nBut first, I logged on to my Internet host to check site statistics.  I'm still getting a ton of hits to that old, boring entry.  I'm also getting hits from Google image searches, but the stats don't tell me what images people are searching to get to me.  Oh well.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nBy the way, traffic is way high.  Don't forget to click an advertiser's link on your way out.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nAfter that, I started poking around, jumping from site to site in search of something to amuse me.  I found <a href=\"http:\/\/www.petitiononline.com\/petition.html\" target=\"_blank\">petitiononline.com<\/a> for the first time, and killed a good while looking at what sort of things people will petition.  I think my favorite was the one to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.petitiononline.com\/ih8bruce\/petition.html\" target=\"_blank\">get Bruce fired.<\/a><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nAfter that, I did a rough draft of this post, and finally got up and got my ass in gear.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI forgot to go visit oln.com.\r\n"

It came up just the other day.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nIn November of 1995, Mrs. theskinnyonbenny and I were newly married and on our honeymoon in Ireland.  November is a cool drizzly month in Ireland (as I suspect most months are), but we were having a good trip. \r\n<!--more--><br \/><br \/>We spent most days driving from one small town to another.  We would eat a big breakfast, and then suffer through the nasty food that they serve the rest of the time.  It got dark early, so we would find a pub where the heavy thick beer would help the unsalted potato mush dinner go down more easily.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nOne night, we were in a nice little place in the seaside town of Kinsale.  We were sampling local beer and whisky and sitting by a fireplace shooting the breeze.  The place was mostly empty.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nA couple of drunk English people rolled into the bar.  There was a little guy, whose name I don't remember.  He resembled Sunny Bono.  He was with his sister-in-law, Ann, who out-hefted by at least a hundred pounds.  It was probably closer to a buck fifty.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nAnn was drunk as a skunk.  She took a seat at the bar, and talked noisily to our table.  Then, she made her way down and took a chair at our table.  Between her thick limey accent and the effects of severe drunkenness on her speech, it was tough to understand what she said.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI don't really remember what we talked about, but I remember that it was a mildly amusing conversation.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nAnn wobbled her way back to the bar stool, where Sunny Bono was still waiting.  Then she realized that she had left her purse at our table.  She took a hard step off of the bar stool, and passed out.  She fell face-first right onto the floor.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nShe hit the ground hard and bloodied her nose.  Her head was toward us, and we could see the black liquid shimmering on the floor.  She made no move to get up.  She was clearly out for the night.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nSunny jumps down and starts to try to pick her up.  But Sunny didn't really have the size or strength to lift her up smoothly.  He grabbed her around the middle, threw his body into a backward arch, and hoisted her to her feet.  <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nMore accurately, he hoisted her so that her feet were in the general direction of the ground and her head was in the general direction of the ceiling.  She did nothing to help keep herself upright.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nShe still faced us, legs dragging and nose bleeding.  Sunny held her tight around the middle.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nBut not tight enough.  Ann's shirt rode up under his grasp without Sunny realizing it.  And Ann -- even though well endowed -- didn't bother to wear a bra. Sunny's feet stumbled around as he tried to keep her upright and not lose his grip altogether. <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nSo picture the two 20ish honeymooners staring right into these big, floppy titties, right under a bloody nose, moving like a marionette puppet with a half step to one side and then two half steps to the other.  Now all of this happened in just a few seconds.  I was still to surprised at the initial fall to have gotten up and tried to help.  I wouldn't have known what to do if I did try to help.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nSunny finally gave up, laid her down, and went outside to get some of their other friends to assist.  They were able to get her out of there with no further incident.\r\n"

She wanted to marinate a good steak, and then sit outside at the Regal Beagle cook on the grill, drink a few martinis, and eat.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nShe had seen a recipe for a certain marinade meat combination that she wanted to try.  It called for center cut tenderloin.\r\n<!--more--><br \/><br \/>I went to Maxwell's market on Corporate boulevard, and browsed the meats in the case.  They had boneless sirloin, filet tips, and even a full tenderloin displayed, but no center cut pieces.  I asked the guy behind the counter.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nHe went to the back and pulled out a long tenderloin.  He let me pick the piece I wanted.  \"From there to about there,\" is how I specified it.  He cut the piece wrapped it up, and gave it to me to take to the cash register.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI picked up one more thing, and went to the register.  As I handed the meat to the cashier, I noticed the price:  $24.99.  For one pound of meat.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nWhen I regained consciousness, I considered my options.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nOption A:  Throw a hissy fit, and take my money elsewhere.  But then, I look like a cheap bastard to the other people, and I was also going to go home without the specific cut of meat that the Mrs. had requested.  Then, if the steak didn't turn out perfect, it would be blamed on my failure to buy the right meat.  The embarrassment of being the cheap bastard weighed more heavily than the other option.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nOption B:  Suck it up and pay $25 for a pound of steak.  I really couldn't win here, because this was certain to get a complaint.  The good thing is that the heart worm pill for the dog, bought the same day was a lot less expensive than I expected.  Even Steven, more or less.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nSo yes, I chose option B, but in an alternate parallel universe, I threw the fit.  It went something like this:<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n\"JEEEZZUSSS CHRIST!  TWENTY-FIVE DOLLARS A POUND.  YOU CAN TAKE YOUR D--- OUT OF MY A-- NOW, THANK YOU!\"<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nHeads turn.  Perhaps a delicate lady faints.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n\"Ummm, well sir, that's our price for custom cuts of meat.  We'll be happy to provide you with an alternative.\"<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n\"HOW CAN THE WHOLE TENDERLOIN BE $16 A POUND, BUT THE CUT I WANTED BE $25?  THAT MINUTE THAT YOU JUST SPENT WAS WORTH $9 PER POUND, OR DID I JUST DEVALUE THE REST OF THE MEAT BY THAT MUCH?\"<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI then unwrap the expensive meat, and drop it on the floor.  I leave.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nIn that alternative universe, we eat instant grits for dinner that night.\r\n"

You see, some people can see an image of the Virgin Mary in this salt runoff, and they are clogging up traffic to go there and worship.  It seems to be in an underpass or something like that.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nDon't get me wrong.  I'm all for whatever makes people feel closer to their creator.  I just have to wonder who first saw the blessed mother in this concrete.  To me, it just looks like an inverted parabola.

There was a wall in Mexico, painted solid white.  The figure of a woman appeared faintly, but it became clear.  People came from miles around to worship.  They called out the church to determine whether it was a miracle, and here's what they found:<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe lazy bastard hired to paint the wall had painted right over a poster announcing a Willie Nelson concert.  The people had been worshiping Willie's image, showing through the white paint.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<b>Postscript 4\/25:<\/b>  Since my godson happens to live in Chicago, I called his parents to demand that he be given the opportunity to see the apparition.

When it gets cluttered up with crap from other things that are going on, that puts my canoe building on hold until it gets cleaned out.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThen, I lose my momentum, and it's hard to get started again.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nLast night, I went out and started working again.  I'm to the point where the outside of the canoe is fiberglassed, and I'm whittling the sticks that make up the body on the inside from a series of flat planks to something resembling a smooth curve.  The main tools are the planer and the palm sander.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThis is one of the most satisfying steps in the build.  It feels a little like being a sculptor.  I can run my hand over one section of the boat, and it feels like a bunch of sticks.  On another section, it feels like a smooth curve.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nOn top of that, I get to hear satisfying scrape of metal cutting wood.  And I get the smell of fresh cut cypress.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nIf that isn't enough, I mix in a caffeine drink and a taste of tobacco.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nIt took twenty minutes to get back into the swing of it, and then it became amazingly enjoyable.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI'm on my way to the garage now.\r\n"

I'm not immune to such thoughts, so I started to take stock in the bad things that I've done.  <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI guess the first things that come to mind are that I like to drink, gamble, and eat too many cookies.  But like all drinkers, gamblers, and overeaters, I maintain that these vices cause no harm to others, and I therfore dismiss them from the list of bad things that I do.\r\n<!--more--><br \/><br \/>In high school, I used to sneak out of the house from time to time.  Mostly, this was to toilet paper another house in the neighborhood. and usually, whoever got it deserved it.  But not always.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI did lots of mean things to my sister when I was growing up.  If I would yell at her good and loud, I could really put a scare into her.  More evil though, is the time that I swished her toothbrush in the toilet, and then put it back.  I don't know if I ever fessed up to that one.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nCollege was the golden years for my evil half.  Most memorably were years of harrassment that I gave our housemother.  If I get started listing all of the bad things that I did to Miss Mary, this post would run for pages and pages.  Perhaps I'll elaborate in the future.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI also used to pull up all of the flowers from the sority houses quite a bit.  I did this for one amazing reason:  by the time I went outside to go to class the next morning, the gardeners would have my vandalized beds back in ship-shape.  I bet the girls at those houses didn't even know about this vandilization.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nOnce, when a friend of mine had gotten a poor grade, we went to the engineering building at night, and I took a dump in front of the professor's door.  I feel bad for the janitor who had to clean that up.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nWhile I was in school, I was a teller.  Just about every afternoon, when I would get thirsty, I would short five customers in a row 10 cents each.  Then, I would use the 50 cents to buy a coke.  Who would go back to the bank drive through just for ten cents?  I just figured out that if I had stayed a teller, and continued to do that for all of these years, I would have embezzled around $1600 by now.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<skinny :nohome><table cellpadding=\"2\" align=\"right\"><tr><td width=\"5\" rowspan=\"2\"><spacer type=\"block\" width=\"5\" height=\"1\"><\/spacer><\/td><td width=\"275\"><img src=\"\/img\/johanna_pugh.jpg\" align=\"left\"\/><\/td><\/tr><tr><td width=\"275\" class=\"caption\">Although Johanna is one of my favorite co-workers, she was the victim of my \"truck nuts\" prank, and many a sudden scare.<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/skinny><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nNow that I'm a grown-up, it's harder for me to think of any really bad things that I've done.  At work, I like to sometimes send emails from other people's computers.  My favorite time was when I sent an email from one sales rep to the rest of the sales department (including her boss) that was something to the effect of, \"If you were wondering what to get me for Christmas, I would really like some <a href=\"http:\/\/truck-nuts.com\" target=\"_blank\">truck nuts!\"<\/a><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI also like to scare the s--t out of coworkers while they work quietly in their office.  Seeing someone jump out of their skin never quits being funny.  A sudden maniacal screen will also scare people walking or jogging through the neighborhood too.  Neeless to say, I don't do this too close to home.<br \/>\r\n\r\n"

I guess I was tired about hearing about it all of the time.  What made me thing of this is that <i>Hey Ya<\/i> came on the radio while I was on my way to work a few days ago. I remembered the Bush girls saying that W and Laura like to, \"shake it like a Polaroid picture from time to time.\"<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI was listening to that speech on the radio that night, and I was amused that the NPR people felt the need to explain that allusion.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nAnyway, while I was driving to work, I started wondering if the pres and his wife had actually heard that song before. And if they really had, didn't they object to the lyric that goes, \"Don't want to meet your mama....Just want to make you come-a.\"<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI picture the Bush family in cut off shorts and stocking feet, sitting around a stuffy formal living room in the White House dancing to <i>Hey Ya.<\/i> And then, when Andre sings that line above, W looks right a Laura, and sings it while pointing an index finger in her face, to the beat of the music. <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nMaybe he even moves his mouth in an exageratted way to really enounciate.  \"Just want to make you come-a...\"<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI think that's the scene that the Bush girls were talking about.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nOn an unrelated missed opportunity, I picked up this catalog that came free with a magazine. The second time I leafed through it, I noticed that there was one and only one girl modeling all of the stuff in the whole catalog. There wasn't that much that had a human model, but every page where there was one, it was this chick.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nHere's the kicker: she was ugly as a bowl of dog food. I don't know if she owned the company or if the real models didn't show up or what. If I had any love for my readers at all, I would have scanned her picture and made fun of her for you.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nBut I threw the darned thing away.<br \/>\r\n\r\n"

We were spending the night together on our boat, and I woke up in the middle of the night to her humping me.  \"Shit, I picked a weirdo,\" I thought.

In fact, she has actually pooped on the floor at APPRO.  We go sailing, tailgating, to parades, for walks, take naps.  We had fun.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nWhen I go to bed, she sleeps in the bedroom.

The twang in her accent, her sarcastic attitude, and the fact that she always -- and I mean always -- uses her outside voice make her show the most entertaining news program on the air.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<embed NAME=\"nsplay\" PLUGINSPAGE=\"http:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/windows\/mediaplayer\/download\/default.asp\" SRC=\"\/vid\/nancy20050228.avi\" TYPE=\"video\/x-ms-wmf-plugin\"  AUTOSTART=\"0\" SHOWCONTROLS=\"1\" width=\"320\" height=\"240\" align=\"right\"><noembed>Sorry Captain.  Your browser does not support plug-ins for digital video.<\/noembed><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nDon't take my word for it.  Let's watch a clip, shall we?  (Like all of the ripped off multimedia on theskinnyonbenny.com, this is presented to you without the knowledge or permission of the owners of the video.  Just wanted that to be known.)  <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThis is a clip during a segment about the BTK killer.  While you're watching, just look at Nancy's face.  And make sure you have your audio turned on.  <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nPay special attention to the dialog and expressions after the camera gets back from the two photographs.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThere you go, I dare you not to laugh at this.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nBy the way, the crappy picture quality comes from the crappy signal that I've been getting from my cable box.  It won't be long before I have to go back to satellite -- Cox is something like 0 for 15 and counting in service calls to fix this problem.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nNow that Nancy has her own show, I might just start a page dedicated to clips like this.  Or maybe I won't.  We'll see.\r\n<\/embed>"

It seems to be the latter.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nEvery boy I knew had experiences where they just come across unexplained pornography for no reason.  For me, it was often a wet matted magazine lying out in the woods where I would play.  There's no explaining how it got there other than as a gift from the porn fairy.\r\n<!--more--><br \/><br \/><br \/>\r\nI remember once in elemetry school, my friend Ryan, my neighbor Tyra, and I came across a dirty magazine.  We were in a large yard leafing through the pictures about 30 yards from the street.  My dad drove by, and rather than play it cool, Tyra snapped the magazine shut and pushed it down into the grass real fast.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nDad asked me later what was in the magazine.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n\"...umm, uh, naked men.\"  I thought naked men might be okay but naked women would be bad.  Plus, it wasn't entirely false.  In the pictures of people doing the nasty, there were, of course, some naked men.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nMy Dad responded with something like, \"Naked <i>men<\/i>?  Naked women I can see, but don't be looking at magazines full of naked men!\"<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI checked in with Ryan later.  He had told his parents that we were looking at pictures of food.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nCan't you just hear the conversations that his parents must have had?<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n\"Honey, he said he was just looking at pictures of food.\"<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n\"Food?  Benny told Dan that it was naked men.\"<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n\"Maybe it was food shaped like naked men.  Or food covering naked men.\"<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nNo, I'm sure it didn't go like that.  But I wonder if they puzzled over whether to call us on it and punish us or whether to just let it go.  I know it was a surprise to get off scott-free.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nJust another gift from the Porn Fairy, I suppose.\r\n"

I just wasn't feeling like spending my free time at the computer lately.  I do spend my entire workday staring into the retina-melting screens you know.\r\n<!--more--><br \/><br \/>I haven't really been doing anything mentionable.  Last weekend, we went to my in-laws' in the north part of Louisiana.  It's a pretty slow place -- I read a bunch of magazines and watched a bunch of junky MTV shows.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nHere are the magazines that I read last weekend:<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<ul><li>2 issues of <i>National Geographic Traveler<\/i>:  I never read this mag before, and I liked it pretty well.  The problem with travel magazines is that there are so many places I'd like to go and do and see, and I realize that I'll probably never get to half of them.  It's a bit of a downer.  On the other hand, I do like to see pictures of these strange places and read about what other people did when they were there.<\/li><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<li>1 issue of <i>Rolling Stone<\/i>:  <i>Rolling Stone<\/i> has good writers, but they don't do the best job of picking their topics.  It's one of those magazines where every third or fourth issue there's something brilliant.  The rest of the time, it's just something to keep your attention while the Mrs. watches <i>American Idol<\/i>.<\/li><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<li>1 issue of <i>Entertainment Weekly<\/i>:  It's just the brain equivalent of potato chips.  There's nothing substantive, but it's fun to consume.<\/li><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<li>1 issue of <i>Sports Illustrated<\/i>:  This one is a cross between brain potato chips and the occasional brilliance.  About once every six weeks or so, there's something that's way above average.  By the way, I just got the Swimsuit issue, but I don't like to peruse in front of Mrs. theskinnyonbenny.  It makes her irate.  For many years, I've brought Iram at work my copy of the swimsuit issue, which he would put in a filing cabinet.  Then, if someone wanted to know something about a three year old issue, he would just pull it out like it was a bank statement or something.  Iram quit a few weeks ago.  I wonder what he did with six or seven years worth of magazines.<\/li><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<li>1 issue of <i>Outside<\/i>:  This is my favorite magazine.  They usually come up with at least one really good topic per issue, and their writers are top notch.  Even though I've never climbed a mountain in my life, and even though I have no desire to, I especially like reading articles about people freezing themselves to near death while trying to make some summit that I had never heard of before.<\/li><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<li>1 issue of <i>Backpacker<\/i>:  The issue that I read was a gear review, so I really don't know if this magazine is any good or not.  The gear review was interesting, but irrelevant to me.<\/li><\/ul><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nIt feels good to be back in the saddle.  I'll post another one soon.\r\n"

		"post_content" : "I am currently reading Phil Jackson's book, <i>The Last Season<\/i>.  It has a subtile which I can't remember.  From reading the text, I'm pretty sure that Phil intended the subtitle to be, <i>...and Kobe Bryant is a no good whining bastard<\/i>, but the editors probably shot that down.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n(Actually -- to be honest -- I downloaded an mp3 copy of Phil Jackson's book, and I've been listening to it while I walk the dog in the evening.  It's not the same as reading the book, but I don't really have the right verb.  \"I'm currently listening to the book,\" doesn't work, because I'm not currently listening to it.  I'm currently typing on a laptop.  You see the problem.) \r\n<!--more--><br \/><br \/>For my non-basketball fan readers, Phil Jackson is the coach who won six NBA championships with Michael Jordan's Bulls, and then three more with the Shaq\/Kobe Lakers.  He's a former player and current Buddhist.  He dates his owner's daughter, who also runs operations for the team.  And he coached two future hall-of-famers who couldn't stand each other.  <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nNeedless to say, this is a fun story.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe bulk of the attention is rightly on Kobe.  He comes through as a selfish, spoiled sociopath.  Phil doesn't speculate about what happened in Colorado, and he doesn't need to.  He has story aplenty about how disruptive Kobe's personal issues were.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 border=0 align=right><tr><td width=5 rowspan=2><spacer type=block width=5 height=1><\/spacer><\/td><td width=190><img src=\"\/img\/philjackson.jpg\" width=190 aborder=0 vspace=4\/><\/td><\/tr><tr><td width=190><font face=\"verdana, arial, geneva\" size=1 color=#666666><b>Phil Jackson<\/b><\/font><\/td><\/tr><\/table><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nEven given his dislike for Kobe, he talks plainly about how necessary Kobe was to the Lakers winning.  The reason that Kobe didn't regularly guard the opponents best guard was that he would get too tired to be the explosive force on offense that he needed to be.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nOn the other hand, Phil seems to have genuine affection for Shaq.  Yes, he gets frustrated about his inability to make free throws, but Phil rightly points out that Shaq gets fouled and fouled hard dozens and dozens of times per game.  But when Kobe would lambaste the team or his coach in the press, Shaq was first to call the coach to ask if he could respond.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nA quick disclosure:  as a former LSU classmate of mine, Shaq can do no wrong in my book.  And by classmate, I mean we were students there at the same time.  I didn't really see much of Shaq in the Electrical Engineering building.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThere are really interesting stretches of narrative about the nuances of an NBA offense, his relationship with his owner's daughter, other players on other teams, and the leadership of Karl Malone.  I haven't been bored for one second of the 5 hours that I've listened to so far.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nAs you might expect, Jackson seems to love Michael Jordan and the glory-years Bulls.  Remember that season that they only lost a few games the whole year?  I think they actually played hard during the regular season.  I defy you to find a team that really does that today.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nMy one complaint is with the reader.  I thought he was okay, until he mispronounced the last name of Dirk Nowitzki (the W is supposed to sound like a V).  Since then I mistrust him.  <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nHe's a pretty well known player.  Would it really have been that hard to ask someone the correct pronunciation?<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n\r\n"

I get a good bit of interesting stuff, and I generally just drag the message over to a folder so that I can give it a good read some time later.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI know this is lengthy, but believe me, I did pare it down quite a bit.  Besides, I'm enjoy all of this nerd talk.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n\r\n<!--more--><br \/><br \/><blockquote>The March, 2004, Volume 30, Number 5 & 6 double issue of \"Practical Sailor\" magazine ran a comparison test on sailor's rigging knives.  They rated the Spyderco SALT 1 as a best buy.  The thing about this knife that caught my eye was the description of the H1 precipitation hardened stainless steel in the blade....<\/blockquote><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<blockquote>So, I went & looked up the properties of H1 stainless steel in the metallurgical literature at the SVSU library.  The H1 alloy is produced by the Myodo Foundry in Japan and it appears to be a real materials breakthrough.  Normally, with knife blade materials, there is a tradeoff between the hardness & ability to keep a sharp edge of high carbon tool steels and the corrosion resistance and nonmagnetic properties of the 300 series stainless steels.  Up until now, it was impossible to have both corrosion resistance and a really sharp blade in the same alloy.  The H1 alloy works differently....<\/blockquote><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<blockquote>I ordered the knife on-line from The Knife Center:  SP88SBK Spyderco SALT H1 Stainless ...<\/blockquote><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<blockquote>...my new toy arrived via UPS over the weekend & I took it to school today.  In the materials lab, we did some cutting experiments on tough, exotic materials like Kevlar, Spectra, and Carbon Fiber.  With the factory supplied edge, my new Salt 1 is so sharp, it's almost scary!  It cut thru several layers of stacked woven prepreg cloth like butter & these were materials that are a lot of work to cut a single layer with a good pair of scissors.  Under the microscope at 100X magnification, there was no detectable wear on the edge before vs. after cutting these materials.  The hardness of the blade checks out at >75 on the Rockwell C scale! ...<\/blockquote><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nSo I had this wonder tool in the back of my mind up until the start of the Christmas season.  (I suppose I shouldn't use the word \"wonder tool\" with my audience, but I'll just call myself on it here and beat you guys to the punch).  I wanted to play with a knife made with this exotic material.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nHere in Louisiana, we have a lot of boating, hunting, and fishing shops that have large knife displays.  I started shopping in December.  Sure I could have ordered one, but with a knife, I like to see how it feels.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nHere's the main thesis of this whole tail:  when you walk into a gun and knife store, and ask, \"Do you have a pocket knife with a blade made of H1 steel?\" you immediately go from being another yahoo customer to being the biggest expert they ever met.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nAnd I'm not an expert at all.  I would have never heard of this particular alloy except for that email message.  Heck, I didn't know that alloys had names like \"H1.\"  For all I know, they could have names like car models.  Maybe Escalade or Bravada Steel.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nAnyway, the kids run to their supervisors, and the old guys go digging for catalogs.  It's really quite a lot of fun.  With what other shopping experience can you instantly become more of an expert than your sales rep.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe final word is that the knife did have to be ordered from the internet.  And it did show up just about sharp enough to shave with.\r\n"

Why don't they just take that last step and advertise. \"Hey wives and girlfriends, your men sure are going to enjoy the hookers while you're at home and they're out here!\"<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nWe all know that the real reason people go to Las Vegas is to binge drink in that oxygenated air, allowing the party to go all night long with no effort at all.  Sure, there are strippers, but once you've been to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.theskinnyonbenny.com\/blog\/archives\/00000020.php\">Super Pussy<\/a>, the rest all pretty much seem the same.\r\n<!--more--><br \/><br \/>Here's one funny story, while we're on the topic.  The bachelor of the weekend was getting a lap dance when two other strippers walked up and said, \"What's going on here?\"  <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe used the tone of voice that implied that they were witnessing something shocking and unusual.  This made me laugh, and I had to call them on it.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n\"I like how you guys pretend that you've never seen such a thing.  This must be a real shocker -- a lap dance in a titty bar.  Who would have imagined!\"<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThey turned and left without comment.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nWe went to one other bar -- the loud music dance club type that all of the casinos have now.  It was a similar scene to the bar called Sports that we went to in college -- packed people, decent music, drinks, etc.  They had a balcony above the strip that was nice, and there were reports of celebrities there, although I never saw any for myself.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nWe were standing around like the lame-dicks we were, comparing the chicks who were dancing.  It was amusing that some guys really liked the classy looking ones and some liked the trashy ones.  <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nOur buddy Troy favored a platinum blond with a body full of tattoos.  She looked rough.  I felt pretty sure that if in some parallel universe I found myself in bed with her, whatever she would do would be not only a totally new experience, it would probably be something I could never have even dreamed up.  And it would probably hurt.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 border=0 align=right><tr><td width=5 rowspan=2><spacer type=block width=5 height=1><\/spacer><\/td><td width=280><img src=\"\/img\/vegaspiechart.gif\" aborder=0 vspace=4 width=275\/><\/td><\/tr><tr><td width=280><font face=\"verdana, arial, geneva\" size=1 color=#666666><b>Lest this article give the wrong impression about where we spent time, here is an accurate breakdown of our roughly 40 hours in Las Vegas.<br \/><br \/><\/b><\/font><\/td><\/tr><\/table><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nNow almost all of the time there was actually spent gambling.  It's just that sitting at a blackjack table for six hours straight doesn't really make for a riveting read.  I guess the best stories there were from the first night when we drank too much and acted totally obnoxious.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nMaking up names for the dealers was fun.  At one table, we called our dealers Brick, or more accurately, \"BRIIIICKKKK\" when they dealt good hands or, \"Fuckin' Brick,\" when they dealt bad.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nWhen one dealer showed up to relieve another who had been dealing winners for a while, Eddie told him, \"Turn around and kick that guy in the nuts.  You're not going anywhere.\"<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI also remember calling one woman Janet Woods -- as in the brunette from Three's Company.  I'm not sure why.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI also got a laugh at the guy at our table who called his homosexual partner \"Buttercup.\"  He wasn't messing around either.  It was, \"You don't want to hit that, Buttercup,\" or \"Buttercup, the waitress is behind you.  Do you want another drink.\"<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe guy brought our table good luck though, so don't be surprised if I start calling any of you \"Buttercup\" next time we're at the same blackjack table.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe gambling gods were good friends to most of our group.  I kept getting asked, \"How much are you up?\"  For the record, I was almost never up, although I got on a roll late and ended up coming home with just $100 less than I left with.  Very successful in my book, but not the hundreds and hundreds of profit that a lot of them had during different stretches over the weekend.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nAnd I almost forgot.  You know that <a href=\"http:\/\/www.theskinnyonbenny.com\/blog\/archives\/00000092.php\">ideal Sports Book<\/a>?  Bally's was pretty close.  It had close food and drink, good layout of screens, personal TV sets, and the people who took your bets were friendly.  <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThey need two major improvements:  First, they need more comfortable seats.  Also, they need the cocktail waitress to be quite a bit less scarce.  Other than that, I was pretty pleased with them.<br \/>\r\n\r\n"

Take it or leave it.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe main reason to come back is the little thing of sauce that they give you with the chicken.  It sort of looks and smells like thousand-island, but it tastes so so so much better.  I'm almost certain that there's an illegal narcotic in there.\r\n<!--more--><br \/><br \/><br \/>\r\nAs a matter of fact, I once asked the girl at the drive through window if there wasn't just the tiniest little bit of heroin in that sauce.  She didn't answer me.  Suspicious, don't you think?<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nMost of their restaurants have a drive through window or two, or a walk up window.  They do have some new ones where you actually get to go inside and sit at a table.  I went to one of these new ones yesterday.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nEverything is pretty much just the same.  Same limited menu, same addictive sauce.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nIn case you were wondering, here are a few things that are different.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 border=0 align=right><tr><td width=5 rowspan=2><spacer type=block width=5 height=1><\/spacer><\/td><td width=275><img src=\"\/img\/chicken.jpg\" width=275 aborder=0 vspace=4\/><\/td><\/tr><tr><td width=275><font face=\"verdana, arial, geneva\" size=1 color=#666666><b>A \"box\" combo when you eat inside at Raising Cane's.  The astute reader will notice the absence of a box.<\/b><\/font><\/td><\/tr><\/table><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThere's a counter with a kid and a cash register, which is different from most RC's, but the same as every other fast food restaurant.  <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nYou pay in advance, and they give you a ticket, like at Taco Bell.  But instead of giving you a number, they type your name into the computer and print that on the ticket.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe big shocker is that the styrofoam box has been replaced with a styrofoam plate.  <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThere's music in the restaurant.  It's pretty good music, but louder than you would get in others.\r\n"

It's just that it hurts less when the asinine nonsense in this space isn't a product of my own brain.  I want everyone to resolve to take the time to email me something amusing next week.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nHere we go...\n<!--more--><br \/><br \/><blockquote>I added your site \"theskinnyonbenny.com\" to a site ring for greymatter users. If you do not want to be in it just let me know and I will take your site out of it.<br><br>have a great day<br>Jim F. <\/blockquote><br \/>\n<br \/>\nMan, links from strangers are awesome.  Back atcha:  <a href=\"http:\/\/jdfitz.com\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/jdfitz.com<\/a><br \/>\n<br \/>\n<br \/>\nMy dad recently went to Nepal.  He sent this dispatch.  I know it's long, but I thought it was a good read.<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<blockquote>Well I made it back from Nepal.  Here's my travel advice:  don't go.  Fly past the Himalayans and Mount Everest because they are breathtaking.  But don't bother to land.  The place is teeming with people, dusty because most of the roads are dirt, most of the roads are really just alleys mindlessly scattered throughout.  The people were aggressive and somewhat in-your-face.  Not too different from a lot of Indians that I have met.  The beggars and hawkers followed relentlessly.  On Friday I walked through the shopping area and by the time I walked 3 or 4 miles I had about 20 people following and yelling at me.  At least they got some exercise.  It reminded me of some biblical scenes you see in movies.  People bathing at the public well etc.  The city is dirty but not too odorous.  Everything is just dusty.  The Nepalese food was good, though.  I'm pretty sure your mom would have never left the hotel.<br><br>Couple of stories.  <Br><br>This set the tone for the trip.  When I got to the airport I found the driver from the hotel and told him who I was and that I arrived from Bangkok.  He said \"Oh, Mr. Samboon\".  I said \"no, Schultz\".  He said \"only Mr. Samboon comes from Bangkok\".  He looked confused so I asked to see his hand written list.  I was listed on the plane from Tehran.   I told him but he disagreed saying Mr. Schultz was coming from Iran.  Then he asked if I was sure I was Mr. Schultz.  I yelled at him that I goddamned well knew my own name, and then I pushed him toward the parking lot.  The hotel van was locked and he didn't have a key. So he took me in his private car - the tiniest car I have ever seen.  I could barely squeeze in.  I think he is still waiting for Mr. Schultz from Tehran.<br><br>I hired a car and guide Sunday for the day and traveled around the Kathmandu valley.  The villages were better than Kathmandu but not much.  We went to a few Hindu temples and the guide insisted on giving the rundown on all the gods and parables.  And there are a lot of gods.  I saw bodies being cremated in the open.  They cover them with grass and herbs to keep the smell down, but the smoke still smells like burnt flesh.  After everything gets good and crispy, they brush the ashes off the platform into the river.  There were about a dozen pyres fired up when I was there.<br><br>This story is more pleasant.  There are some gods peculiar to Nepal.  One is the \"living God\", a girl that is chosen when she is two or three.  She must be \"perfect\".  No blemishes.  She is highly revered and is the only person in the Kingdom that the King bows to.  If she is cut or scratched, or if she sees poverty or if she is touched by a lower caste, she becomes tainted and is replaced.  If she stays pure then she lasts until she reaches puberty when she becomes \"unclean\".  Anyway she lives in a temple with a courtyard and some high open windows.  The place isn't very big.  My guide called \"Damus\" and clapped his hands.  Some big guy came to the window and the guide asked if the living god would present herself.  He called and a beautiful little three year old girl dressed in red and fully made up pranced out on the balcony, did a pirouette and disappeared.  I thought my guide might faint.  That was probably the highlight of the trip.<\/blockquote><br \/>\n<br \/>\n<br \/>\nSee?  I told you it was a good read.  Now here's one that really isn't so good.  This is an email reply that my nephew received in response to a think.com application.<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<blockquote>Greetings Booger ,<br><br>This email is to advise you that an application has been submitted for pantyhoes junior high  for membership in Think.com with Dr. Booger McPanties listed as the contact person for your school, district or LEA. The application process includes the execution of the Think.com School Agreement .....<\/blockquote><br \/>\n<br \/>\nI would have liked to be in the office when humans actually read the application from Dr. Booger McPanties.  The part that the email doesn't say is that Dr. Booger's occupation is \"Tittie Watcher.\"  Filling in Web Forms with bullcrap is fun.  I have a feeling that Dr. Booger McPanties might be applying for loans online some time soon.<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<br \/>\nHere's an exchange that I was made privy to earlier in the week.  This isn't the whole thing, but you get the gist of the conversation.<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<blockquote><b>Mrs. theskinnyonbenny:  <\/b>I am trying to fix it before it becomes a problem.  You 'borrowed' it about a month before you left.<br><br><b>Steve:  <\/b>I was just looking at this email one more time before I deleted it.  It's funny how you put borrowed in quotes as if to be sarcastic.  Like I heard this lady in Popeye's say one time when the cashier made her mad \"you better take two steps back and one step up\". <br><br>      I'm not sure what that means, but it sounds threatening ... <br><br><b>M:  <\/b>I interpret that the customer is about to punch the lights out of the cashier, however, is kind enough to warn the cashier to take a step back through a confusing mathematical exercise, which nets out to a step back.  What do you think? <br><br><b>S:  <\/b>I always thought one step up was vertical, meaning she better step back and insulting her on being short at the same time.  Your explanation makes more sense.  Ask Ben, he probably would speak jive better than us.<\/blockquote><br \/>\n<br \/>\nI didn't chime in on this directly.  Although I do indeed speak very fluent jive, I could do nothing other than tarnish this golden exchange.  Every detail is perfect.  Think how much less funny this story would be if it were set in McDonalds rather than Popeye's.  <br \/>\n<br \/>\nCome to think of it, have any of you <i>ever<\/i> been to Popeye's -- any Popeye's in your entire life -- without seeing some sort of angry customer altercation?  I think I've seen them happen in the drive through.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nFor the record, Mrs. theskinnyonbenny's answer is just a sliver away from being right on the money.  She gets partial credit for sure.  However, the judges were looking for the phrase \"bitchslap\" in place of \"punch the lights out of.\"<br \/>\n<br \/>\n\n"

This is an important question for me this year, because the LSU men's team just is not that good, and the Hornets are downright godawful.  <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThis should be the first year since the Hornets have moved to New Orleans that I don't make it down for a few games.  They have won three of about thirty games so far.  Their best players are either injured, begging to be traded, or both.\r\n<!--more--><br \/><br \/><br \/>\r\nThey traded their starting off guard for Jim Jackson at the end of December.  He has thus far failed to show up, choosing instead to forgo his NBA salary and perhaps get a start on his janitorial career over playing for the Hornets.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe Saints brass must certainly be happy that just as they showed signs (however slight) of being a competent organization, the Hornets take the baton of inept New Orleans professional sports franchise.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 border=0 align=right><tr><td width=5 rowspan=2><spacer type=block width=5 height=1><\/spacer><\/td><td width=275><img src=\"\/img\/temekajohnson.jpg\" height=200 aborder=0 vspace=4\/><\/td><\/tr><tr><td width=275><font face=\"verdana, arial, geneva\" size=1 color=#666666><b>LSU Point Guard Temeka Johnson<\/b><\/font><\/td><\/tr><\/table><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI decided early in the season to dedicate the energy that I would have otherwise put into the Hornets into following the LSU women's basketball team.  In that team, there is all that I look for:  good defense, good ball movement on offense, and most important to me, a point guard who is good for at least a few awesome assists each game.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nBut again, the main question is how much grief to give the opposition.  For some reason, it feels right to yell, \"YOU STINK!\" or \"HOW CAN YOU CARRY THAT GIANT GUT UP AND DOWN THE FLOOR?\" at male college students, but I don't feel right yelling similar things at female students.  I especially like to pick on the fat players, but that just won't do at a woman's game.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe crowd in general seems to feel the same way.  Last game, there was some consistent booing of one opposing player, but only after she layed a cheap foul and hurt one of LSU's stars.  There is the normal jeering during warm-ups, but even the group of students is easier on the opponents during the game.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI think this is an interesting study in group behavior.  A sociologist-type  should do a study.<br \/>\r\n\r\n"

Fairly friendly.  I wonder why I can remember people who beg from me three times in a year, but I can't remember to take out the garbage on Thursdays.  Tonight, he wanted a ride to Tom drive.  It was real close, so what the heck.\r\n<!--more--><br \/><br \/>He started his hard luck story:  mother just died, car broke down, no one he can call, etc., etc.  He needed nine dollars to get a part for his car.  I noticed that he didn't smell like a beggar.  I actually detected a faint scent of soap.  Both the inside of my Jeep and I smelled worse.  Weird.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nHe dropped an ugly racial slur.  What reaction do people expect from a stranger when they do something like that?  I kept quiet, figuring that the absence of any reaction at all was probably the best way to proceed.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nHe asked for a couple of bucks.  I told him that I didn't have any money.  I had paid for my lumber with a credit card.  This was the truth.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nHe swore that he's an upstanding citizen and that if I would drive through the ATM and get out $10, he would find me and pay it back.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nBefore we get to my response, imagine how I explain that to Mrs. theskinnyonbenny:  \"Sweetie, I know you put us on a budget, but I just got out ten bucks to give to a professional beggar.  I knew you would understand.\"  I'm not sure what the reaction would be, but it would be very, very ugly.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nSo I lied:  \"The ATM won't give me any money.  You know how it is with Christmas and all.\"  Or maybe that part wasn't a lie.  How the heck would I know?  I have no insight on our finances.  <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI did let him have the change in my ashtray.  Roughly 80 cents, I think.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nWe went a couple of miles, staying on busy streets.  I started to get nervous.  The hard luck stories continued.  I acted like I was searching for something under the seat, just to make him think.  We sat at a red light silently.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nHe had me drop him off at a motel a quarter mile from my office, but no longer on Tom Drive.  It's tough to keep your hard luck stories straight sometimes, I guess. I had never noticed this motel, even though it had a bright neon sign at night.  It wasn't fit for human occupancy.  Home sweet home.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n\"Good luck buddy.\"<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n\"I need it,\" he replied.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nAmen to that.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n\r\n"

I have them listed from best picture to worst.  <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nIt was actually tough to make fun of the group at the top.  They took such a good photo that I had trouble thinking of anything that was anything other than just personal insults, and I didn't want to go there.

I went out to the living room where the gas fire still warmed the air.  I watched most of Sports Center and a little bit of the news on CNN.  Then I took a shower and went to work early.  It was a normal start to a day that would end very abnormally.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nMaybe because it is the week of Christmas, but work was quiet.  I was able to work more or less uninterrupted on a semi-fun design document from 6:30 until my stomach finally made me get up and go out just after 1:00.  After lunch, I had a quick meeting (which was a little bit painful) followed by a call to resolve issues for a client.  That was more painful still, but not really as bad as I had expected it to be.<br \/>\r\n\r\n<!--more--><br \/><br \/>When I got home, Mrs. theskinnyonbenny was geeked to go pick up our nephew to spend a few days with us.  I was pretty worn out and immediately started some preemptive complaining, but it was to no avail.  Off we went for a three-hour round trip.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nOur 10 year old nephew Sam was excited to get away from real grown ups for a few days.  He chattered non-stop all the way back.  Our favorite pastime is to make up rhymes and songs with ridiculous and inappropriately off-color words.  A nighttime drive through Louisiana is a good place for that.  It was fun for a while, but I was tired of it before we made it home.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nAfter a short whirlwind of activity through the house, I finally found the opportunity to sneak off to bed.  I turned on the bedroom TV, which due to my wiring expertise, automatically switched the kitchen TV to what I was watching in the bedroom.  Sam came in to complain that the kitchen TV had dumped his cartoons for football without any warning.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nMy reply was something to the effect of, \"tough titties,\" with an afterthought of, \"shut the door good, so Daisy won't go sleep on the couch.\"  He struggled with it and got it shut.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n(I know, this story is dragging.  I'll try to pick up the pace).<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nWhen Sam went upstairs, Mrs. theskinnyonbenny tried to go to the kitchen to make sure everything was off.  But she couldn't get the doorknob to open.  She rattled it and fudged with it, all the while putting me in a more and more foul temper.  I finally got out of bed and tried it myself.  No dice.  The damned door was locked from the outside.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nSo here's the situation:  Mrs. theskinnyonbenny and me, locked in our bedroom.  There's a door to the outside, but it's dead bolted, and neither of us have our keys in the bedroom.  Sam doesn't hear us scream, and he doesn't answer the phone.  I'm wiped out, and mad as a damn hornet by this time.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 border=0 align=right><tr><td width=5 rowspan=2><spacer type=block width=5 height=1><\/spacer><\/td><td width=275><img src=\"\/img\/ben_dogdoor.jpg\"  width=275 aborder=0 vspace=4\/><\/td><\/tr><tr><td width=275><font face=\"verdana, arial, geneva\" size=1 color=#666666><b>Yes, I fit through this door.<\/b><\/font><\/td><\/tr><\/table><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI finally decided that I had to go out the dog door.  I stuck my legs out and immediately realized that it was cold outside.  I was squiggling like a snake, trying to find the angle that would allow my ass to fit through.  Then, my shoulders didn't want to go, and I thought I would be stuck for a minute.  Meanwhile, my legs dangle over the dog balcony and hover a couple feet higher than the ground.  (Clearly, our dog door setup is unconventional).<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI finally squeezed out, and found the back door to the breakfast room mercifully unlocked.  Sam got an earful, but seemed neither amused by my predicament nor remorseful for putting us in said predicament.  I would have expected one reaction or the other.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nTonight, I sleep with the door open.\r\n"

But as much as I like to read, I don't really like to read my own writing.  I know that doesn't make much sense, but that's the way it is.  The idea of writing pages of stuff into a journal that no one would ever read seemed rather silly to me.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nMy idea to write a web-based journal started a few years ago.  It just stayed at the idea stage for a year or two.  I kept a travel log on my first trip to Thailand, and the few people who read it seemed to like it.  On second thought, I don't really know that, but at least they read the whole thing, so it seemed promising.  For the next year, I had ideas about adding lots of photos and videos and building a site that lots of people would visit.  Last fall, I decided to do it for real.  In December, I bought the \"theskinnyonbenny.com\" domain, and I went live in January.\n<!--more--><br \/><br \/>One thing that never inspired me is other people's web logs.  I never really looked at any others until very recently.  Mine certainly isn't typical.  The typical site has a professional look and feel that puts mine to shame, but the posts are either short, pointless comments in the dark, or they are a rambling meaningless mess.  Of course there are some exceptions.  I have read some others the weekend that are very good.  <br \/>\n<br \/>\n<table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 border=0 align=right><tr><td width=5 rowspan=2><spacer type=block width=5 height=1><\/td><td width=275><img src=\"\/img\/sanjuan.jpg\" height=200 width=275 aborder=0 vspace=4><\/td><\/tr><tr><td width=275><font face=\"verdana, arial, geneva\" size=1 color=#666666><b>This is a photo from my recent trip to Puerto Rico.

I was pretty close to not posting the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.theskinnyonbenny.com\/blog\/archives\/00000062.php\" class=\"mainbox\">one where I argue with a little kid about pajama pants<\/a>, and it turns out that this is by far my most asked-about post.  The lesson:  I have no clue about what entertains and what sucks.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nI personally like the posts with pictures, but I haven't added a photo in over a month, and no one has complained.  I'm going to keep doing them, if only just for me.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nOne thing I haven't gotten much of is participation from others.  I think I've had a total of three blog comments, although I bred the \"no-comment\" culture by not allowing them for so long (because I was too lazy\/busy to make the technical aspect work like I wanted them to, not because I didn't want the comments).  The bulletin board isn't used at all and is on the shelf for retirement.  I know the reason for that:  it's just too big a pain in the ass.  Too many levels of hierarchy, having to sign up and keep an active user\/password, etc.  I'm going to look for (or build) a simpler BB program that would make it easy for all to participate.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nOn the other hand, there are two full pages that were written entirely by others and that were good.  Thanks for those.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nOh yeah, I suppose I should comment on my atrocious spelling and word misuse.  Like I mentioned above, I don't like reading what I wrote.  It tends to lead me down a path of self-editing that feels never ending.  I'll try to do better.\n"

We remembered \"Three Man\" being a game with dice that made the players do a lot of drinking.  To be honest, we remembered a dice game called \"Three Man\" or \"Four Man\" or \"Seven Man,\" but we couldn't remember which, and we certainly didn't remember all of the rules.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nShelly Williams may have the foulest mouth that I know, but she can do research.  Last time I saw her, she gave me a pack of dice and a laminated copy of the official Three Man rules (so spilled drinks don't ruin the page).  I hereby reprint those rules for posterity.\r\n<!--more--><br \/><br \/><blockquote class=\"caption\">Everyone starts off by rolling one die until someone rolls a three.  This person then becomes the three man.  The game then proceeds around the circle with people taking turns rolling the dice.  The dice are only passed when someone rolls something that does not require drinking.  Here is what each roll means:<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<table cellpadding=\"3\"><tr><td valign=\"top\" class=\"caption\" align=\"right\">3<\/td><td class=\"caption\">Whoever is the three man must drink.

This person rolls the dice and must drink for that many seconds.  The dice may be given to two people instead of giving both to just one person.<\/td><\/tr><\/table><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nAt any time during the game the three man can be told to drink.  However, the person currently rolling may not tell the three man to drink.  If he does, he must drink.<\/blockquote><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThis is pretty much the game I remember, but there were some small differences in how we played it at LSU.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nFirst, you couldn't just tell the three man to drink any old time.  As LSU students, we might have just killed each other with that rule.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nTo make up for that, any roll with a three in it meant the three man had to drink.  So if the total was three, or if either die was three, the three man had to drink.  On double threes, the three man had to drink twice.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nIt's not really a rule difference, but I also remember that on ten, it was customary for everyone to hold their drink aloft and say \"social\" enthusiastically before drinking.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nNow, I'm going to show the nerd side of myself a little bit.

The place is called Coffee Call, and I would give you a link to their web site if I knew of one for them.  I'm not really here to advertise anyway.\r\n<!--more--><br \/><br \/>First of all, if you're not from around here, a biegnet is a big bit of fried dough served with a mound of powdered sugar.  I often hear people compare them to a doughnut, but I think a funnel cake is a better starting point.  They're bigger than a ping pong ball and smaller than a baseball.  Cafe au lait is just strong coffee mixed with warm milk.  (Louisianans aren't normally the types to stick fancy French names on mundane things, but \"cafe au lait\" persists as an exception to this rule.)<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nRunning a biegnet shop has to be one of the noisiest, dirtiest jobs outside of construction.  The main culprit is the powdered sugar, which is normally poured over the biegnets to the point where the dust will gag you.  Coffee Call keeps several of the really big plastic garbage cans full of powdered sugar, and they just scoop it liberally over the biegnets.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe sugar gets all over everything:  you breathe it, it's on your clothes, it's in the pages of your newspaper, it's on the floor.  The people who serve the biegnets have hands that look like they're about to do a parallel bar routine in gymnastics.  <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nBecause the sugar is so messy, the prudent biegnet store will have a tile floor that they can easily mop or hose off.  And since biegnets are so good, and since so few places are willing to put up with the hassle, the shop tends to be busy.  You end up with a zillion people making conversation in a tile room.  When it gets really crowded, it sounds like a nuthouse.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI have never been to Coffee Call when there wasn't a tray dropped on the floor, which leads to spewing coffee and sugar, and a clatter that would hurt Eddie Van Halen's ears.  Sometimes it's fun just to sit in there and watch the people spill things all over themselves.  Some get really mad, and some take it very well.  It's impossible for me to predict who will blow their stack.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI guess all of this must sound unpleasant, but it really isn't.  The patrons are normally pretty friendly.  Sunday mornings are best because people are trying to keep the mess off of their nice clothes.  And the coffee and biegnets are really, really good.  I'm not kidding about that.  I think I might like them better than doughnuts, and anyone who has seen me around doughnuts will attest that I like fried dough.  A lot.\r\n"

More importantly, LSU had a good season this year.  Keep reading, and I'll back that up.\r\n<!--more--><br \/><br \/><br \/>\r\nFirst, let's talk more about the national championship. Let's agree right here and now that any team that wins it all can't complain before four more seasons have come and gone.  Do you really want to hear Yankees fans griping about what a raw deal they got this season?  I think four years is a good amount of time, because five years is how long we had to suffer through both the Dinardo and Hallman eras.  I don't think I missed a home game during the Hallman era, and in most of those games we were losing bad.  In the rain.  And up until 1991, I was probably there with an ugly date.  So don't even begin to tell me this season was disappointing.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nCome to think of it, my freshman year was the one where Mike Archer's team was raked fifth in the preseason, and he complained about that ranking being too low.  Then, the Tigers went on to a losing season.  Clearly, my being an LSU student brings bad luck.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nSo let's think about this season a minute.  We lost to two top 10 teams, both on the road, both early in the season.  We lost a lot of good players to the NFL, and had no quarterback with any real experience.  We had Auburn, Georgia, and Florida all on the road in consecutive weeks, and had a hurricane threat right in the middle of it all.  Then, the team had to get fired up for Troy and Vanderbilt sandwiched between bye weeks.  It was about as horrible a schedule as you could put together.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nAuburn has a legitimate claim to the title game, and it took them two fourth-and-long conversions and a bad referee call on an extra point at the very end of the game to get past LSU by a single point.  Man, that really hurts to relive, doesn't it?  Getting a title takes some breaks during the season, and Auburn got them this year.  Change any one of those plays, and it's LSU vs. Tennessee in the SEC championship game last weekend, and probably LSU's third Sugar Bowl berth in four years.  Oooh, the thought of it makes my stomach hurt.  But that's football, and I'll take a 9-2 season with a New Year's bowl any year.  Ask your favorite Mississippi State fan if he doesn't agree.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nNow, let me go a little bit off topic for a minute.  Remember a few years ago when LSU clobbered rent-a-win Miami of Ohio, and Nick Saban got a letter from their quarterback <a href=\"http:\/\/www.lsusports.net\/article.cfm?ref=000F0897-FC3C-1D88-BC3C809F187EFD7F\" target=\"top\" class=\"mainbox\">thanking the team<\/a> for showing class during the romp?  We thought that the kid would go on to a successful session in dental school, or insurance sales training, right?  Wrong.  Ben Rothlisberger is the darling of the NFL media.  I thought I'd mention it, since I haven't heard any of our local media people bring it up.  Besides, the Saints are playing for draft position, so I figure that anything that makes a Sunday game at all interesting would be worth sharing.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nRemember:  3 more football seasons before you get to bitch.  Good luck in your bowl pools.\r\n"

		"post_content" : "At first, I thought it was my lucky day.  I was about to board a three and a half hour flight, and I just found out that I had been granted an unrequested first-class upgrade.  I'm not sure why; I'm just barely to the \"silver\" level of Delta's rank and grade system, but I guess that combined with low demand for those seats combined with having purchased a ticket that any sane person would laugh at got me through.<br \/>\r\n\r\n<!--more--><br \/><br \/><br \/>\r\nI settled into my big plush window seat, and asked for a diet coke, momentarily forgetting that I could have had a free vodka tonic, bloody mary, or beer.  Shit.  A few minutes later, my seat neighbor arrived.  He stumbled to his seat and started to try to stuff a large but mostly empty hanging bag under his seat.  He smelled like a distillery had exploded and he had just spent four glorious days rolling in its muck.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nMy drunk friend introduced myself and asked if I was going to Miami for business or pleasure.  I had a momentary moment of panic.  I thought I was on the plane to San Juan.  Then I noticed his boarding pass sticking out of his pocket that said San Juan.  I replied, \"business.\"  If he thinks he's going to Miami, then I'll just go with that.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe drunk guy was a blue collar New Englander, a salesy type guy who liked to talk.  I was game to talk about the Patriots for a little while, but I didn't want to gab for the whole flight.  We started talking football, the plane started to taxi, and he called the stewardess over to order a bloody mary.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nNote to self (and Brent):  Stewardesses get bitchy when you stink of booze and try to order a drink during taxi and takeoff.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nWhen we were barely in the air, the stewardess came by to see what dinner selections we preferred.  He opted to order a bloody mary.  The bitter stewardess made him select between chicken or lamb.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nA little while later, hot napkins arrived, along with the drunk guy's bloody mary.  This put him in better spirits.  He wiped himself with the napkin, and the celebrated by holding it above his head and waving it around in circles.  It was about this time that I decided that I wasn't going to get to read, but that this guy might amuse me for a while.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nWe talked about ourselves for a while.  I spoke normally.  He spoke like a guy in a bar.  I saw other stuffed shirts in first class try to read the same page over and over, getting more annoyed the whole time.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nWhen he got up to go to the restroom, I took the opportunity to put on my headphones, pull down my cap, and stuff my face in my magazine.  He followed suit by pulling out a CD player and donned his own headphones.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nAfter a couple of minutes:  \"WHAT ARE YOU LISTENING TO?\"  He was screaming.  That's no exaggeration, he really was.  Heads turned angrily in our direction.  <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nRather than embarrassment, this amused me, and I carried on the conversation for several minutes with headphones on and this guy screaming his entire side of the conversation.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nHe kept drinking and started talking crazier.  Here are some more snippets:<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<ul><li>\"You know how much money I brought?\"  <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI didn't know.  He opened a little shaving bag and flipped through a stack of hundreds that was an inch thick.  He squirmed around so that he could reach into his pocket and show me a similar wad.  Holy cow, this guy really is crazy.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n\"No one knows about all of this money.  I run my own business, which allows me to take a little at a time that no one knows about but me.\"<\/li><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<li>\"My wife didn't know where I went.  I just had enough of the cold, so I left.  I called from the airport and she was relieved.  Then I called from Atlanta, and she was pissed.  Women.<\/li><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<li>\"I was supposed to go to Costa Rica. But they wouldn't let me board because my passport is expired.  They rebooked me to Puerto Rico.\"  This never occurred to him before he bought the ticket.<\/li><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<li>\"You ever been with a black woman?\"  We're gettin' kind of personal now.  He talked for a while about his desire to get with a black woman.  The other passengers pretended that they weren't listening.<\/li><\/ul><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nAt the end of the flight, he got a bottle of water.  The liquor had made him hot, so he took off his hat, poured some water on his head, and then shook vigorously from side to side like a dog.  This got most of the people in first class a little bit wet, leaving some pretty annoyed looking faces.  I have to admit that I was tired of this guy by now too.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nWe departed, and I told him where I was staying.  \"Look for me in the sports bar at the Marriott.\"  I was both relieved and disappointed to find out that there was no sports bar at the Marriott.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nWhen I got to the airport to return home several days later, I saw a crowd by the gate, so I diverted my path and went to a less crowded area.  I sat down in a chair, looked up, and -- I swear this is the truth -- it was the same guy.  He was sober this time, but still crazy.  He asked me to look after his stuff (the shaving kit that had held so much cash, and the near empty hanging bag) so that he could go buy a paper.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nWould you believe that the guy was gone 45 minutes?  He decided to buy his family some souvenirs while he was shopping.  He even bought me a bottled water.  I suppressed the urge to pour it on my head and then shake the spray all over everyone.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI didn't see this clown once I had boarded my flight back to Atlanta.  I don't know what his name was.  I'll definitely keep an eye out for him the next time I fly.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n\r\n"

		"post_content" : "While my entries are in this reminiscence theme, allow me to spin you another tale of childhood.  I guess most of us had that summer or two of childhood where we were old enough to run wild, but not quite old enough to drive or be tied down by a summer job of any consequence.  When I was of that age, we lived in a subdivision in Little Rock with tons of other kids of my age.  We spent every minute between waking up and curfew roaming the neighborhood in packs.  <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nWe played basketball, went to the pool, and spent hours and hours at someone's house watching MTV.  This was in the days of that network where the moon man was a current commercial, and veejays talked briefly between music videos.<br \/>\r\n\r\n<!--more--><br \/><br \/>We did most of our video watching at Charlie Evans's house.  His was the place of preference because his parents worked late, because his dad had a really large collection of <i>Playboy<\/i>s (three stacks in his closet, and you could stumble on other issues if you would look deep in other magazine racks in the house), and because every summer he had two good looking female cousins come visit.  I think Charlie was jealous that he was the only one of us who couldn't make up lies about all of the scoring we did with his cousins every summer.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe fun at Charlie's ended when his mom got home.  In retrospect, she wasn't really that bad, but at the time she was the most feared force in the universe.  She was a gigantic woman, who we always referred to as \"lard-ass,\" or often just as \"L.A.\"  As a sideline, Lard Ass sold Avon, and she was occasionally could be persuaded to drop you a few bucks in exchange for leaving little baggied Avon catalogs on neighbors' doorknobs.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nLard Ass remains amusing to me to this day, because she was so loud when she would fly off the handle at Charlie or at his brother, which was pretty darned often.  She was also far more profane than any other adult that I knew.  One time, I was in their front yard making my way to the front door when I heard her yelling from 15 yards away from the house.  And yes, all of the doors and windows were closed.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nCharlie had a slightly older brother who was a chubby, quiet, and awkward guy.  One afternoon, he was sitting in a director-style chair that Lard Ass won for selling so much makeup.  (I think he was painting models of dragons, or something like that.)  When Lard Ass got home that evening, that scene set her off.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n\"CURTIS!! WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING IN MY DIRECTORS CHAIR!!!  GET YOUR FAT ASS UP!! I DON'T NEED YOU BREAKING MY GODDAMNED CHAIR!  WHO TOLD YOU THAT YOU COULD SIT THERE!!!\"<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI know this seems like a horrible situation when you read about it, but you have to appreciate the comedy.  I don't think Charlie or Curtis took her seriously when she went into a rage.  We all laughed about it just about every day.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThat poor old Curtis was some kind of nerd.  When we had enough people, one of our pastimes was to stand around Curtis in a circle, and whoever he was facing away from would kick him in the butt.  He would turn around to yell at the person who did it (since he was older, Curtis fancied himself the guy in charge and did his best to play the part), and then the next guy right behind him would kick him in the butt.  The best thing about Curtis is that this could go on for 20 minutes before he would finally get pissed and lose his cool.  I guess when you lived with Lard Ass, you made a point to keep calm so you wouldn't end up like that.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nIt's only fair that I share a Lard Ass story that doesn't revolve around her temper.  I was eating dinner there one night when for some reason, Charlie's old man leaned over and kissed her at the table.  She kissed back for a second and then started to squirm away, like a cat will do if you plant a kiss on its lips.  Then she turned to us and had a great quote.  Make sure you read this to yourself with a good, thick Arkansas accent.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n\"GOD DAMN Y'ALL, HE WAS TRYING TO FRENCH KISS ME WHILE I STILL HAD CORN IN MY MOUTH.\"<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n\r\n"

		"post_content" : "The other night, I got to trying to think of what were the earliest things that I could remember.  I came up with a good number of short scenes that were all before I moved from Baton Rouge during Kindergarten.  I remember the house we lived in on Woodbine, and I remember washing the car with my old man.  (Specifically, I remember him showing my how to get the whitewalls on the tires good and clean.)<br \/>\r\n\r\n<!--more--><br \/><br \/>I remember doing things with my friend Kip, who -- like all friends that age -- is forced into friendship by parents who hang out together.  I remember us being interested but not really understanding the Olympics that were going on.  So that must have been the 1976.  I remember him telling me that a basketball game that was on TV was part of the Olympics, and me telling him that the Olympics couldn't <i>possibly<\/i> still be going on.  Whether this was indeed Olympic basketball and I couldn't fathom a two-week sporting event, or whether this conversation happened during basketball season months after the Olympics I haven't a clue.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI remember a little bit about how the furniture in our old house was arranged.  We had a dark brown chair with yellow and orange flowers.  Ugly fabric.?  Not really.  You see, that pattern was just a really heavy duty plastic of some kind.  That chair stayed with us for years, living on the porch of many houses, and being called \"Flo's Chair,\" since it was the only piece of furniture that the dog was allowed on, and it's where she could often be found.  Anyway, I remember climbing on Flo's chair (back when it was human furniture) and talking to my mom about the baby that was going to join our family.  I guess that would have made me four.  I don't think I'll remember much earlier than that.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI can picture a kindergarten teacher whose name was either Miss Brown or Miss Black.  I don't know if that was in Little Rock or in Baton Rouge, and I'm sure I only remember her because the fact that her name was also an accurate physical description.  Things like that made an impression on my young brain.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nMy close friend in Little Rock was a kid named Jason -- by now, chosen for myself since I was in school.  The times that I spent the night at Jason's house were my first real exposure to pubescent kids and to older siblings.  I was still into stuffed animals (of course I might still have my stuffed bear if it hadn't burned up in an orange Volkswagon Van, but that's a story for another day); Jason had a poster of Christie McNichol on his wall.  And having those older siblings, he knew all about what boys and girls did together.  In retrospect, he really did know way more than a second grader should have.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI don't remember Jason's last name, but I remember that both of his parents were named Jackie.  One night, we decided that we would pretend to be Indians.  We ran into the room where the two Jackies were watching TV, naked as the day we were born.  We made that Indian noise that happens when you move your hand to your mouth and back while you scream, and we ran crazy around the room shooting imaginary arrows.  At some point, we decided that we had been shot up with enough bullets or arrows and dropped dead on the living room floor.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI can still hear Jason's mom like it was yesterday.  Exasperated, almost to the point of being out of breath:  \"Jesus Jackie, get them out of here.\"  That's as funny to me now as it was when I was eight.\r\n"

Especially the past couple of weeks.  Yesterday I said that if there was a runoff in our Senate election, and if that meant I have to see the advertisement with David Vitter's premature babies one more time, I would yank out my own tongue and strangle myself with it.  Vitter won, sparing me the horrible decision of having to watch that commercial any more or to take my own life in a most horrifying and painful manner.\r\n<!--more--><br \/><br \/>In case you're recalling <a href=\"http:\/\/www.theskinnyonbenny.com\/blog\/archives\/00000063.php\" class=\"mainbox\">my previous post about Vitter<\/a>, he did win without the benefit of my vote.  I can't say that I'm too broken up about it.  He's not awful, and had there been a runoff, I certainly would have picked him over Chris John, who finished behind him.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI'm not nuts about the result of the presidential election, but I wouldn't have been nuts about it had it gone the other way either.  On election day, I passed a bunch of poncho-clad volunteers waving Kerry signs at a busy intersection.  I can't imagine the candidate that would get me that excited.  I wish one of them would.  It would be nice to feel like you were potentially close to having a great leader.  Oh well.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nWhile I'm on the topic of elections, I should share the two things that I would do to change how we have elections.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nFirst, I would start all elections like Louisiana does -- an open primary with all of the candidates in one pool, regardless of party affiliation.  Then -- unlike Louisiana -- I would allow each voter to cast one vote for as many of the candidates as he likes.  So, if you adamantly support one candidate, you would just give your vote to him.  If you absolutely hate one guy, you vote once for everybody but him.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI think this method would give the rational people the power to weed out the nuts.  The problem with our current system is that a few normal candidates split the vote enough that we have to pick between two terrible candidates with high nut-case followings.  Recall the Louisiana governor election where we had to pick between a former KKK honcho and a known criminal.  <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI know this seems like a messed up system, but think about it.  It's beauty will dawn on you.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe other change I would make is that for any ballot that is a race between people for an office (as opposed to propositions or amendments or things like that), I would include an option for, \"I don't want to elect any of these people.\"  Votes to that wouldn't really count in any way, but they would be tallied and reported to the media.  There are many, many, many elections where I wished I could push this particular button.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n\r\n"

For a while, I knew the prices of all of the cheap things that they used in the games, and to this day, I remember that Klondike bars were priced at $2.99 on TPIR in the 1993 timeframe.  If I had gone on that show at about that time, I would have kicked serious ass.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nIn this song, Bob cried because he is famous as an animal lover.

I just don't think these broadcasters are trying to entertain me as hard they used to.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nFirst, I have to call out Donald Trump for what's left out of <i>The Apprentice.<\/i>  No, I'm not crazy enough to believe that we see most of what happens on a reality show.  I don't even think that we get the real story.  Of course they are going to edit the whole thing in a way to make good TV for us viewers.  The successful shows pull it off.  We're entertained, and have a reasonable belief -- rightly or wrongly -- that we know what happened.\r\n<!--more--><br \/><br \/>Donald Trump and Mark Brunett aren't making me a believer this season.  There's just too much that they leave out.  For example, last week, they got a phone call from the Don's secretary with a short, terse instruction to meet him in Central park the next morning.  They all show up, and somehow, they all knew to wear casual clothes instead of their suits.  Amazing coincidence that they wore those clothes and would be getting dirty?  I think not.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe worst part has been the obvious voice-overs in the board room the last two weeks.  Donald is talking about what a disappointment one contestant or other is, and the camera goes to their faces for reaction.  Then, in mid sentence, Don's voice will change entirely.  The words carry on like they're logically connected, but you would have to be mostly deaf not to catch it.  The echo from the board room is gone.  And Don goes from a natural speaking cadence to what you can tell is a read.  It's not a bad read.  He does pretty good.  But still, it's not what was actually said.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nIf they would just take the tiniest effort, it wouldn't be so noticeable.  Couldn't they re-record his comments in the same room so there aren't obvious acoustic differences.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nSpeaking of somewhat obvious reads, you have got to turn on WWL in New Orleans at halftime of the next Saints game.  Buddy D's \"comments\" are delivered with such a bad read, that if you aren't a regular listener, you will think it's a spoof.  I'm not kidding when I say that it sounds like a bright second grader or a dumb fourth grader.  I think he has to sound out his words, and <i>he's the one that wrote it in the first place!<\/i>  For cryin' out loud.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nOh -- I almost posted this without pointing out that the guy talks like he has a mouth full of cotton.  Maybe not cotton, because he isn't quiet, but it does seem like there's something in his mouth that prevents him from making clear consonant sounds.  I know it's hard to imagine if you haven't heard it for yourself.  Believe me, it's hard to describe.  he also does a nightly show that is 100% Saints, because if you get him off of that topic, he might as well be talking about the molecular structure of mitochondria.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI guess my point is this:  how on earth does a barely literate guy who can't speak clearly and only knows one topic get a job in radio?  And get this:  he's immensely popular.  Only in New Orleans.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nOn a similar note, Ashlee Simpson got busted in a lip-synch fiasco on Saturday Night Live this past weekend.  For her second set, the music started playing the same song she had done on the first set.  I happened to catch footage of this cluster on TV this morning.  It is really quite hilarious.  She didn't know what to do, so she hopped around like a maniac for about 30 seconds, and then she jogged off stage, bailing on the performance entirely.  Impressive.  Makes you feel a little silly about burning your old Milli Vanilli cassette tape doesn't it?<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nAt least we know that Saturday Night Live really does run live.  I wonder if Ashlee's disaster still played on tape out west, or if they cleaned it up before it aired out there.\r\n"

Their songs were fantastic, they got the audience really involved, made fun of the other bands, and ran off wholesome family types with f-bombs.  I can't say enough how much I liked them.  I wholeheartedly recommend seeing Green Day live if you ever have the chance.<\/li><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<li><b>The Beastie Boys:<\/b>  I'm not the biggest fan of the Beasties to begin with.  Let's face it, it was almost half my life ago since I had to fight for my right to party.  But their performance <i>sucked<\/i>.  They had a couple of segments where they actually tried to play instruments.  I heard boos (even if they did come from my group).  I would say that I like two of the songs that they did.  And the DJ was very impressive (when the instrument thing wasn't going on).  Other than that, it was bad bad bad bad bad.

I've never posed for so many fake pictures in my life. She took some pretty blatant pics of total strangers.  Here's the best story:  she uses Megan's camera to take the picture known as, \"the butt crack.\"  Little does she know that the camera bathes the target in orange light before snapping the photo.  One of butt crack's friends looked right at the scene as the light illuminated the crack.  I noticed butt crack sitting more discretely a couple of minutes later, but no one said anything to us.  I wonder how it feels to be told, \"hey, that stranger just took a picture of your butt crack.\"  You would think I've been there, but I don't recall that ever being the case.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 border=0 align=right><tr><td width=5 rowspan=2><spacer type=block width=5 height=1><\/spacer><\/td><td width=275><img src=\"\/img\/voodoo04\/passedout.jpg\" height=200 width=275 aborder=0 vspace=4\/><\/td><\/tr><tr><td width=275><font face=\"verdana, arial, geneva\" size=1 color=#666666><b>Who could these people be?

However, the passing of Christopher Reeve moved a reader enough to request that I comment, so I'll share a quick Superman story, and then move on.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe first video tape that our family owned was Superman II.  This was a betamax tape, acquired in the days when it wasn't clear that VHS would become the dominant format in the market.  I say \"acquired\" because we took it from my Uncle Steve's house when he passed away.  I'm not sure if no one else wanted the video, or if it was a last ditch effort to keep the kids quiet, but somehow, our family ended up with that video.  \r\n<!--more--><br \/><br \/>(It's odd that I remember where we got such an obscure childhood relic.  My sister brings up childhood episodes that I don't recall, or just barely recall one after another.  There must be hundreds of them that just didn't stick to my brain cells through a college career with too much drinking.)<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nAnyway, Superman II is the one where Superman goes into some machine that takes away his powers (for some reason, Louis didn't want to date a guy with powers) just as three bad guys from Krypton land on the planet to wreak havoc.  Of course, it gets satisfactorily resolved, somehow or other.  As kids with a new video will do, we watched it over and over and over and over and over.  The thought is horrifying to me now.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI can't name any other role that Reeve played, and I'm not interested enough to take 90 seconds to go look it up.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nBut I did want to look up the Roseanne quote that I've heard about.  Here's the whole thing:<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<blockquote>Dr. Phil is just a used car salesman with barnyard psychology. Once he turns off those cameras, nobody does anything that he says. He's a fat slob talking about how to lose weight. Who wants to hear that? . . . I just hate Dr. Phil and his wife! I shouldn't go off like this, but he's just so stupid and the cause of the dumbing down of America. It's so purely evident if you just watch five minutes of this guy. He's just a huckster used car salesman, scam artist . . . I'd like to knock the [bleep] out of him! Dr. Phil is Hitler! I think he's Hitler reincarnated! When Dr. Phil and his wife had President Bush and his wife on their show, it was probably the scariest thing ever seen on television.<\/blockquote><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI guess this achieved her goal of getting her name back in the spotlight.  But you have to admit that this is really pathetic.  Dr. Phil?  Is there any public figure who would have made Roseanne look <i>more<\/i> stupid?  Maybe she could have blasted the midget that played Tattoo on Fantasy Island.  Or nice old guy like Wilford Brimley.  Or a little girl -- crap, I can't come up with a famous little girl.  Maybe she could have just made fun of Christopher Reeve.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nActually, I may sound bitter, but that's just kidding.  I'm secretly saying to myself, \"ahhh, Rosie's right!  I never realized that Dr. Phil was an overweight goofball who doesn't merit my respect.  How could I have been so naive?  What would I do without Rosie?\"<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nIf I actually believed that Dr. Phil would let loose and beat the living tar out of here, then it's a pay-per-view celebrity boxing match that I might just shell out to see.\r\n"

I remember watching Rodney doing stand up on HBO and being or delivering the punch line in the Lite Beer From Miller Gang commercials back when I was a kid.  I've decided to memorialize Rodney with a brief review of all of his movies.  Okay, not all of them, but all of them that I could come up with off the top of my head.\r\n<!--more--><br \/><br \/><table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 border=0 align=right><tr><td width=5 rowspan=2><spacer type=block width=5 height=1><\/spacer><\/td><td width=140><img src=\"\/img\/rodney1.jpg\" aborder=0 vspace=4\/><\/td><\/tr><tr><td width=140><font face=\"verdana, arial, geneva\" size=1 color=#666666><b>Rodney Dangerfield in Caddyshack<\/b><\/font><\/td><\/tr><\/table><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nCaddyshack:  Possibly the best comedy of all time, and certainly Rodney's best performance.  Almost every scene in this movie is fantastic, and there are more quotable than Casablanca.  Look no farther than that recent commercial with Tiger Woods doing scenes from Karl the groundskeeper to see that this one is still culturally relevant.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nMy favorite line won't read well, but I'll write it anyway.  Rodney is in the pro shop talking a mile a minute.  It goes something like this, \"I'll take two of those three of these six of those golf towels a box of those naked lady tees...what's with this hat, you buy one and get a free bowl of soup?\"  He spots Ted Knight wearing the exact same hat.  \"It looks good on you though,\" accompanied by the most classic eye roll of all time.  The gesture is genius.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nHow great would this movie have been if we didn't have to follow Danny Noonan around from scene to scene?  And is there a more useless character in all of movie history than Maggie?  Did they just need  to pad the minutes to make it a little longer, or could they just not stomach a movie with no female character whatsoever?  Oh well.  At least they had the sense not to spend much time with it.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<i>Easy Money:<\/i>  This was another one that I really liked.  It's my second favorite.  You don't hear too many people talk about it, but the jist is that Rodney is a regular working class guy, and he can become rich if he can give up unhealthy food, cuss words, smoking, and drinking for a year.  It's a pretty good concept.  I'm not rushing out to buy the DVD, but if it's on cable, I'll stick around and watch.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<i>Back to School:<\/i>  This one gets more run than the rest, and it has some pretty funny parts, I admit.  But I have to say that it's pretty average overall.  There's too much plot; the whole relationship with his kid stuff is weak.  And the \"Triple Lindy\" dive that wins the meet is just stupid.  Rodney Dangerfield flipping around the screen in slow motion is a little bit funny, but it's just <i>too<\/i> stupid for my taste.  At least the Triple Lindy lives on as a menu item at Moes burrito shops around the nation.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<i>Ladybugs:<\/i>  I know that I saw this, and that it had that obnoxious woman from the TV show 227 in it with him.  I remember that it had something to do with a girls' soccer team.  I remember thinking that it was horrible.  That's all I can recall.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<i>Natural Born Killers:<\/i>  You almost can't count this as a Rodney Dangerfield movie, but I do remember him as the creepy father of the girl killer for an uncomfortable scene in the beginning.  I didn't really understand much of this movie, but that early scene with Rodney was most baffling.  He would be dirty and creepy, and they played a 1960's style laugh track when he would say something.  But he never said anything funny.  It was just bizarre.  I don't really recommend this movie, if you couldn't tell.\r\n"

Let's review the history of the magic hat.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI bought the hat as a souvenir in Maine last August.  It was a nice hat.  Nothing special, but I liked it.  I had also bought a hat at the track in Saratoga on that same trip.  Again, it was nothing special.\r\n<!--more--><br \/><br \/>When we returned home, I had to make a decision about which hat would be the one to wear most of the time.

(That's University of Louisiana at Monroe, for those of you out of state.  Yes, it's a real college with a real football team.  They have matching uniforms).  Now the first game is always hot as hell, so with sweat and rain certain in the forecast, the nasty hat got the call.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe next couple of games were also hot, dirty days.  The nasty hat got the call, and the Tigers started winning.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nOn the morning of the Florida game, I went to campus before daylight to stake out a good spot for a tailgate party.  Since it was so early, I forgot to throw on a hat.  I called Mrs. theskinnyonbenny and asked her to bring it.  Mrs. theskinnyonbenny chose the <i>other<\/i> new hat, and LSU lost to Florida.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nNote:  if any USC boosters ever make it to this page, you really should shoot Mrs. theskinnyonbenny a twenty in the mail.  I'm convinced that it was only because of this miscommunication that USC \"shares\" the national title, according to most.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe only time after the Florida game that I took it off during football was right after the half of the South Carolina game.  I had taken a shower during halftime, and didn't put it back on right away.  LSU had three miserable series, but they found their game right as I found my lid.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nOn the weekend of the Arkansas game, it picked up a sticker from a little kid, and <i>the sticker is still there!<\/i>  Now this was Thanksgiving weekend almost a year ago.  Tell me <i>that<\/i> isn't magic!<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nWith all of those games last season, including the SEC and national championship games, plus the couple of early games this season, the hat went 15-0.  <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nLSU lost the Auburn game this year, but I didn't really remember the lucky hat until close to the fourth quarter.  That raised my doubt about the magic of the hat.  I rationalized that maybe I have to have it on through kickoff.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI had the hat on several hours before the Georgia game Saturday.  I won't regurgitate any of the details, but obviously, the magic is gone.  <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nFrosty is just another snowman in this house.\r\n"

At least one writer did kind of have the same ideal that I did.

Wasn't there anything in the trial that appeared in dark blue?<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nOne thing that I had kind of secretly hoped before coming out is that I would feel a real, real mild earthquake, just to see how it might feel.

Nothing more than that.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nSure enough, there was one a few hundred miles from here yesterday, and I understand that it had decent strength.  But it wasn't strong enough.  I felt nothing.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe client that I'm visiting has their lending operations in a strange building, which must have been very state-of-the-art in the 1960s.  The work is done in a big church-style chior loft, which hangs over a large branch.  The opposite wall -- where Jesus would hang on a cross, had this actually been a church -- is pale green, and covered in stuffed ducks. I can't really begin to explain that choice in decor.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nMore baffling is the original bank headquarters building a few blocks away.  It is a beautiful old building, completely decked out in marble, with teller windows that remind you of George Baily's savings and loan.  In a fit of the bad-taste mania that somehow affected America in the 60s and 70s, they made the decision to abandon this headquarters, and move to the world of art-deco.  Alas.\r\n"

		"post_content" : "I had a most unimpressive conversation with a campaign worker for David Vitter last night.  Vitter is running for a soon to be vacated U.S. Senate seat for Louisiana.  She started by asking if I was \"Mister McClood.\"  (She was working on an old telemarketing list.  Mrs. theskinnyonbenny's maiden name is McLeod, but it was even mispronounced.  Not to mention that there never was a \"Mr. McLeod\" at our phone number.)<br \/>\r\n\r\n<!--more--><br \/><br \/>I told her that there was nobody by that name here and started to hang up when she asked if I was a registered voter.  I told her I was, and she went into a really bad read of some prepared campaign text.  Honestly, it sounded like a third grader stumbling through the words.  And heck, third graders don't get to rehearse.  She had probably read the same text dozens of times already.  It only lasted a minute or so, and she asked if Mr. Vitter could count on my vote.  I told her that I hadn't done my homework on the Senate candidates yet and asked why she thought he deserved my vote.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nHer response:  \"David Vitter is for the war on terror.\"<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nSo I was to presume that his opponents are all for making things good for terrorists?  Of course not.  So I replied, \"well yeah, I'm sure all of the candidates are against terrorism.  Tell me what sets Vitter apart.\"<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 border=0 align=right><tr><td width=5 rowspan=2><spacer type=block width=5 height=1><\/spacer><\/td><td width=175 align=right><img src=\"\/img\/vitter.jpg\" height=200 aborder=0 vspace=4\/><\/td><\/tr><tr><td width=175><font face=\"verdana, arial, geneva\" size=1 color=#666666><b>Candidate David Vitter.  So far, I'm not impressed.<\/b><\/font><\/td><\/tr><\/table><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nShe asked me what issue was important to me.  This was clearly her highlight -- a really intelligent response, and not rehearsed in any way.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI asked this totally unanswerable, loaded question:  \"What does he suggest we do in order to get our troops out of Iraq, and leave a peaceful country in our wake?\"  Again, there is no answer to this question.  Anyone who tells you that there is a way to get out soon and leave peace is a bumblehead.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nShe didn't call me on my loaded question, but she didn't answer my question either.  I got, \"He agrees with Mr. Bush.\"  She then invited me to call an 800 number or visit the <a href=\"http:\/\/davidvitter.com\/\" class=\"mainbox\" frame=\"_blank\">David Vitter web site.<\/a>  <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n(To be fair, here are links for the other candidates that stand a chance in November.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.chrisjohn.com\/\" class=\"mainbox\" frame=\"_blank\">Chris John<\/a><br \/>\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.johnkennedy.com\/\" class=\"mainbox\" frame=\"_blank\">John Kennedy<\/a><br \/>\r\nArthur Morrell - I can't find an official site for his campaign.

No one has ever accused me of being the most mature grown-up in the crowd, but I proved over the Labor Day weekend that I can be as childish as, well, as a real child.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI don't guess it matters how we got into the situation, but Jake needed some clean pajama pants, and I was the one dispatched to get them.\r\n<!--more--><br \/><br \/>Annika went up to his room with me, purportedly to help me find the pajamas, but in her own mind, her mission was more sinister.  She had a very deep, primal, inner need to keep her brother from putting on clean pajamas.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nFirst, she tried to distract me.  She wanted to show me something in her room.  I wouldn't bite.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThen, she tried to show me that the pajamas were in Jake's closet.  I suppose she thought I would see just normal clothes, and then give up on finding pajamas.  I went to the closet, but caught on quickly that I was being duped.  I mean really, who keeps pajamas in the closet?<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nAt this point, I wised up to the fact that I was dealing with an opponent rather than with an assistant.  Annika sensed that I was now in combat mode, and went up another notch.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nSimultaneously, I found pajama pants in a drawer, and the battle was on.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n\"YOU CAN'T BRING THOSE DOWN\"<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nWhy not?<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n\"HE CAN'T WEAR THOSE NOW\"<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nOut of my way, little girl.  I have pajama pants to carry down the stairs.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n\"BUT IT'S A WASTE OF LAUNDRY.\"<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nHuh?  (That one stopped me for a second, as I tried to comprehend.)<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n\"IT'S A WASTE OF LAUNDRY!!!\"<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI still didn't (and don't to this day) really understand that argument, but this was the point where I bent over and stuck an index finger right in the poor little girl's face.  \"Do <i>you<\/i> do the laundry around here?\"  I went on, without waiting for the response.  I was talking fast and loud by now.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n\"I know you don't, and I think that whoever does do the laundry wouldn't mind Jake wearing clean pajama pants.\"<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nWith that, I took them down and put them on the kid.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nAnd then, I sat there and gloated.  I think I stopped short of actually making eye contact and then sticking out my tongue at Annika, but I sure did want to.  She continued to whine about her brother's pants for a while, which made my inward gloating all the worse.  (I know... I fear that I might be evil.)<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nIf you're too worried, don't be.  As soon as Annika was inclined to be noisy and disruptive again, we made friends in a hurry.  \r\n"

It started last week, with the following email from my friend Jackie.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<blockquote>From:  <a href=\"mailto:Jackie@starmountlife.com\">Jackie Loup<\/a><br \/>\r\nSent: Friday, September 10, 2004 7:52 AM<br \/>\r\nTo: Ben Schultz<br \/>\r\nSubject: Hello<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nBen,<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThis lady is a friend of my friend, Gay.  She just got laid off at FiServe and saw the posting on the web.  Can you forward this to HR?  She is interested in the Product Management Business Analyst position.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThanks,<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nJackie<\/blockquote>\r\n<!--more--><br \/><br \/>Now you have to understand that Jackie and I worked together for several years.  For most of that time, we even shared an office.  She knows me well enough that by some clue in my glazed-over eyes, she could tell if I had spent lunch eating six pounds of cheese-laden Mexican food, or whether I had put myself through a rigorous workout.  In other words, she knows me well.  This will be important in a minute.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI opened the resume, and it had the normal bullet-point bullcrap that people put in resumes.  Here's an excerpt:<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<blockquote><ul><li>Conception and detailed business design documents for system enhancements.<br \/>\r\n<\/li><li>Partnering with and directing programming teams during the coding of system enhancements.<br \/>\r\n<\/li><li>Testing and certification of system enhancements, bugs, and special projects.<\/li><\/ul><\/blockquote><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nCoincidentally, I had just seen a page from The Onion calendar with \"Words Most Commonly used in Resumes.\"  There were a bunch of good ones, but one of the funniest (and most offensive) was \"Faggoted Up.\"  So, I opened the resume in Word, arrowed down four or five bullets, and added,<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<blockquote><ul><li>Faggoted Up the help files for customers delinquent on their bills.<\/li><\/ul><\/blockquote><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThen, I replied to Jackie with something like, \"Nice resume, but what's with that fifth bullet point?\"<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThat's when we had a minor Christmas miracle, right here in September.  As well as Jackie knows me, she didn't get that I was messing with her.  Fantastic!  I never dreamed that there was the possibility that she would believe that she sent me a resume that included the phrase \"Faggotted up.\"<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nFirst, she tried to explain, although she was clearly struggling...<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<blockquote>Don't know...hopefully she was using faggot in the \"bundling\" context.......<\/blockquote><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThen I think she actually called the friend who sent her the resume, and recommended changing the language of that line item!  I'm laughing at her out loud as I write this.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nAfter a couple of days, I got a confused call from Jackie, wondering if she had sent me the right person's resume in the first place.  She had gone back and looked, and couldn't find the reference to \"Faggotted Up.\"  I didn't really get a chance to speak.  As soon as I chuckled, she knew that it had been me all along.  I really enjoyed the whole episode, though, and I promise that I didn't forward the altered resume to others at APPRO.\r\n"

Instead of a nap, I got a cheerful, \"now you can cook the burgers!\"  Oh well, I drank a beer or two, and started the charcoal.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nIt was a pretty good time.  There was a pool to see who could guess the closest time to when it would start raining.  No one took the pot, as it never rained.  We also played, \"For whom would you go gay?\"  We had three female votes for Madonna, one for Cameron Diaz, and one inexplicable call for Sandra Day O'Conner.

Traffic had been ridiculous during the day, so I figured I would go out when it was only me and a few other nuts.<br \/>\r\n\r\n<!--more--><br \/><br \/><br \/>\r\nMy immediate impression at that hours was of the quiet.

There was no distant whisper of tire noise or rumble of eighteen wheelers from the interstate.  Yes, at that ungodly hour, there were thousands of cars and trucks sitting idle on I-10, waiting for the traffic to move.  I found a radio station taking calls from the people who were stuck.  Some had been traveling from New Orleans for nine hours and were only just to Baton Rouge.  To make matters worse, most of the gas stations were out of fuel.  Talk about a sucky night.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe drive to Mandeville was right from the twilight zone.  Traffic on I-12 was bumper to bumper going west, but I had the whole eastbound interstate almost to myself.  There's a stretch where the other lane is blocked by trees.  That plunged me into darkness, which was startling after forty minutes of headlights in my face.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nMandeville itself was a ghost town.  Every gas station was dark.  Waffle House was closed.  And I sure as heck could have used some coffee at that point.  There was no inclement weather yet. <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 border=0 align=right><tr><td width=5 rowspan=2><spacer type=block width=5 height=1><\/spacer><\/td><td width=275><img src=\"\/img\/ve_dark.jpg\" height=200 width=275 aborder=0 vspace=4\/><\/td><\/tr><tr><td width=275><font face=\"verdana, arial, geneva\" size=1 color=#666666><b>Velvet Elvis all tucked in this morning.<\/b><\/font><\/td><\/tr><\/table><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe marina was pleasant.  More than pleasant, really.  There was a nice, cool breeze coming from the north.  The area was quiet as the inside of a cotton jar, except for the gentle clanging of rigging on masts.  The water was smooth, looking jet black but reflecting lights.  I really enjoyed being alone with my boat and docklines and cleats.  It was so peaceful, I am inclined to go out there at 4:00 AM every once in a while, just for the serenity.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nAfter a half hour, it was back on the ghost highway, to join the throngs barreling to the west.  The interstate really was packed with as many vehicles as it could hold, but traffic kept moving at a good rate.  About 30 miles outside of town, it came to a stop, which I knew was the traffic being backed up from the I-10 jam all the way in Baton Rouge.  I hopped the median and took an exit that I had recently passed, to take surface streets home.  I think I did okay.  It took another hour to get home, but I have to think that the interstate would have been worse.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI have to think that our state can do a better job evacuating New Orleans and the rest of South Louisiana.  And just wait until all of those people try to come home.  Did you know that the only place in America where I-10 goes to one lane is just after the Mississippi River eastbound in Baton Rouge?  Boy, is that going to be a madhouse.\r\n"

Enough fear to call out and make sure that the footsteps could be accounted for.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n(For the record, they were just those of Mrs. theskinnyonbenny.

		"post_content" : "The lapse between the previous entry and this one is probably the longest gap I've had between online entries.  The reason has to do with the problems that my hosting provider unintentionally dumped on my site, which I only mention in case you blame my natural laziness.  This leaves me with a backlog of topics to explore, some more interesting than others.  I'm going to start with one of the less interesting:  my thoughts on the Olympics.  \r\n<!--more--><br \/><br \/>Let's start with the pre-Olympic Michael Phelps hype.  NBC practically assured us that he should win 8 gold medals.  In retrospect, it was clearly just to sucker us into watching.  It's now clear that Phelps chose to participate in events that he was less likely to win so that he could race Ian Thorpe head to head.  NBC knew this, and they set up Phelps in the only possible scenario that could make him disappoint Joe American.  Besides, who really cares if an athlete comes back with eight medals or four?  Does eight medals make Phelps a better Olympic athelete than the three Kenyans who took medals in Steeplechase?  Of course not.  It's just that there's only one Steeplechase, and there are about four thousand swim events, as far as I can tell.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nClearly, the number of swims needs to be pared.  I bet anything that I could stage an olympics, race the exact same swim a few days apart with different people, and no one would notice.  And while we're cutting sports, trampoline and synchronized diving are this year's events that I don't remember seeing before, and which I hope never to see again.  The winter Olympics is fortunate not to have this problem.  Not too many people are making up faux sports that have to be played in snow or on ice.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe story of the women's gymnastics team is similar.  NBC made out like they were supposed to be disappointed in the silver medal.  NBC's just wrong on this.  It looks to me like they are rightfully proud of their silver medal.  More interesting than the event is the fact that they all look pretty much identical.  I haven't heard anyone mention this, but is it possible that there's a factory cloning US Olympic gymnasts?  How else can this be explained?  All-around gold medalist Carly Patterson is suposedly from Baton Rouge, but I never heard of her before the Olympics.  Surely I would have heard about a native Baton Rougean (is that the word?) who was a world class gymnist.  I would have heard, unless that world class gymnist is a clone with a made up personal history and home town.  I haven't even run into anyone who knows the Pattersons.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nLet's move on to the disappointing men's basketball team.  I think it might be dawning on the NBA types that basketball is a team sport.  It's shocking enough to them all when the Pistons with no real stars beat the Lakers, with four hall of famers in a seven game series.  It's worse yet that a team of NBA stars gets beat by the Puerto Rican national team.  It doesn't matter that the US team isn't the group of all-NBA stars that it could be.  It's a bunch of guys who don't pass, and don't shoot all that well.  I'm personally glad to see them lose.  Maybe we'll see the NBA teams start to do little things like pass and take jump shots one of these days.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe most annoying thing in all of the coverage is the medal count.  Who cares what countries lead?  The U.S. should have the most medals.  No country shares our combination of size, population, and wealth.  But I'm no more proud of a Californian winning another medal than I am of a South African or a Mexican, or a Russian.  Sure, it's great for the individual, but I only see the locals as my home team.  Fro example, LSU graduate Muna Lee runs in the 200m finals tonight, and Bennie Brazell runs the 400m hurdles the day after.  It's too bad Bennie can't catch a football to save his life, but I guess he gives the LSU defensive backs someone good to try to cover in practice.  <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI seem to have digressed, but I really haven't.  We all know that the Summer Olympics are just TV filler while we wait for football to start.  First kickoff's Saturday.\r\n"

It was a really nice morning, especially for August.  It was almost a little bit cool when we first left.

On the up side, I did get a really cool blood smear on my glove.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nAt 7:00 or so, we decided to press on around the River Road loop rather than turn around.  Before a whole lot of time passed, I realized that the loop is longer than I remembered.  At any rate, it was a better ride than boring old River Road going back toward campus.  But, by the time we had completed the whole loop, I was ready to be done.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nTrudging back against the wind, we got to see a lot of the hot air balloons landing right up close to the road.  Some of them had very smooth landings, and others looked like they were struggling.  They are huge and fascinating right up close.  The scene was quite unusual.  A desolate, mostly deserted area suddenly filled with people, colors, police, and chase cars.  I wish I had brought a camera.  It was certainly a welcome break.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nAfter I got home, we had to go to Mandeville and put the motor back on the boat.  Our motor is a small engine, but it is a four-stroke, and it weighs a freaking ton.  To make it harder to lift, it had been overfilled with oil for the transit, and some had leaked out.  So that made my job to hover and then slowly lower this slippery, massive hunk of metal out over the water in a controlled fashion.  I don't mind telling you that it was very, very, very close to going in the drink.  Had I had one less calorie of energy, I would have lost it.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThen, of course, the carburetor was flooded with oil and wouldn't start.  (I write this as if I understand what a carburetor is.  I really don't.)  By now, the sun was high, and the heat in the boat's cockpit was blazing.  I pulled and pulled and pulled and pulled the start cord to no avail.  Finally, it coughed and smoked and somehow started.  I let it run for 5 minutes or so until the emissions cleared a bit.  From there, it wasn't too much of a struggle getting to the place that is currently painting the bottom.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nAfter this adventure Mrs. theskinnyonbenny and I, went to Lowes, and spent two hours purchasing concrete supplies, including 15 80 pound bags of concrete (that's 1200 pounds, in case you were reaching for your calculator).  Due to earlier cycling, lacked leg strength to push around the store for long.  <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nFinally, near the register, I even let Mrs. theskinnyonbenny push the buggy a minute.  Of course, the appearance of me walking alongside my wife, who is pushing an overloaded cart full of concrete got some attention.  Yes, I got made fun of by strangers.  But heck, it won't be the last time.  And did they ride 48 miles that morning?  I think not.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nJust writing this has brought back enough fatigue that I won't continue on to Sunday, but it was no less exhausting.\r\n"

As you might imagine, showing up after lunch with your mane lopped off leads to some good reactions.  I wish I had thought to set up the video camera to catch the expressions of passes by.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nWhen you show up with no hair, everyone's a comedian.  Some questions are good, and some are bad.  The comparisons to other bald people are mostly pretty good.  (More on that in a day or two.  Look for a new page.)<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nHere are the questions that I'm asked most commonly.\r\n<!--more--><br \/><br \/><table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 border=0 align=center><tr><td width=5 rowspan=2><spacer type=block width=5 height=1><\/spacer><\/td><td width=375><img src=\"\/img\/benbald.jpg\" width=325 aborder=0 vspace=4\/><\/td><\/tr><tr><td width=375><font face=\"verdana, arial, geneva\" size=1 color=#666666><b>That there's one ugly son of a gun.<\/b><\/font><\/td><\/tr><\/table><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<ol><b><li \/>Why did you do that ?<\/b><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI know that what you really mean is that I look a lot uglier now.  Yes, I was really good looking with a full head of hair, but heck, there's no harm in letting some of the other guys get some attention once in a while.  <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nWhat I get in the trade off for my good looks is air conditioning.  My head was hot.  Damned hot.  Miserable hot.  A walk outside for an hour felt like an all day trek through Mexico.  Just sitting inside in the air conditioning was hot.  It was awful.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nOne more thing:  I'm not the one that has to see my ugly cranium.  I catch a mirror only a couple of times a day.  It's the rest of you who notice my looks.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<b><li>So is it cooler now?<\/li><\/b><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nYes, honestly, it really is.  Not only is it cooler, it's just generally comfortable.  It's fun to rub a bald head, or to slap it a little, like Curly from the Three Stooges.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<b><li>Did your wife know?<\/li><\/b><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI've been threatening to shave my head for years.  I'm pretty sure that I was well past the point where she really thought I would do it, but then again, I don't think that it was a total shock.  She knows me pretty well.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<b><li>So what did she say?<\/li><\/b><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI remember it something like this...<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<blockquote><b>Mrs.:<\/b>  [Nervous laughter]...put it [my hat] back on.  You look like a freak.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<b>Me:<\/b>  Wanna feel it?<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<b>Mrs.:<\/b>  [More laughing]NOO!  Get away from me, freak!<\/blockquote><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<b><li>Did you lose a bet?<\/li><\/b><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nUm, yeah, I heard that one already.  About 60,000 times, as a matter of fact.  You really aren't funny, if that's what you came up with.  The funnier variety was, \"Who won the bet,\" which was actually amusing the first 3 or 4 times.  Well, maybe the first 2 or 3.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe question that I ask myself is, \"where did you get that big dent in your skull?\"  I've got a indentation not unlike a shallow tire tread just north of my right temple.  If anyone reading this remembers bashing my soft noggin into a shelf when I was a baby being carried, then go ahead and fess up.<br \/>\r\n\r\n<\/ol>"

But he wasn't there.  Instead, there's scratching in the cabinet above the stove.  I turned on the light and opened the door.\r\n<!--more--><br \/><br \/><br \/>\r\n<table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 border=0 align=right><tr><td width=5 rowspan=2><spacer type=block width=5 height=1><\/spacer><\/td><td width=275><img src=\"\/img\/gatsby1.jpg\"  width=275 aborder=0 vspace=4\/><\/td><\/tr><tr><td width=275><font face=\"verdana, arial, geneva\" size=1 color=#666666><b>Proud Gatsby<\/b><\/font><\/td><\/tr><\/table><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nLet me back up for a moment.  This takes place on the evening before my flight out of town for work.   Although he's getting better, Gatsby is having a little bit of a hard time adjusting to having two kittens in the house.  To lift his feline spirits, Mrs. theskinnyonbenny and I have taken to treating him like a celebrity when he comes in the house.  So, when I heard him in the kitchen, I started that way.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nWhen I opened the door it was dark inside, I heard a scurring and cellophane rustle, and two pieces of bowtie pasta came flying down toward me.  In the span of about a quarter of a second, I had screamed an obscenity, and slammed the door.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nA note to the men readers:  when you have to leave your wives home by themselves for a few days, it's not good to get the shit scared out of you in your own kitchen.  This doesn't leave them with the sense of a safe, friendly, secure home that you've worked so hard to create over the years.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nAnyway, I turned on the kitchen light and slowly opened the door again.  There is a hole in the top of the cabinet, and from inside the whole a mouse peered back at me defiantly.  It was a lot like that semi-circle mouse hole that you see all of the mice use in cartoons.  I hadn't seen anything like that in real life before.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe mice are out in full force.  Now that we've cleared up the lethal level of mold spores, a mouse has moved in there.  And Gatsby just left us a dead mouse to play with in the back yard the other day.  In fact, in that picture above, you can see it by his proud little head.  Here's one more where he plays with it.  Are you impressed with my ability to catch an action photo?<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 border=0 align=right><tr><td width=5 rowspan=2><spacer type=block width=5 height=1><\/spacer><\/td><td width=275><img src=\"\/img\/gatsbymouse.jpg\"  width=275 aborder=0 vspace=4\/><\/td><\/tr><tr><td width=275><font face=\"verdana, arial, geneva\" size=1 color=#666666><b>This little mouse has had better days.<\/b><\/font><\/td><\/tr><\/table>\r\n"

Try as I might to write about the only thing going on, it's very hard to find an interesting spin on the proceedings.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nAl Sharpton's speech was fun.  I like that the teleprompter worker couldn't find where he should be, because Al was running on his own.  Maybe this is why it was so amusing.  Al's no politician.  He speaks to bluntly and honestly to ever be elected.  And, it's a little frightening, but a lot of what he says makes sense.\r\n<!--more--><br \/><br \/>  No, I'm not ready to buy 40 acres and a donkey for the next slave descendant that I meet, but I do agree that keeping non-English speakers out of the country is bad.  Weren't almost all of our ancestors non-English speaking immigrants fairly recently in the big scheme of things?  And who are the \"lazy Americans\" that stagnate the economy, white guys who write web log entries at work, or Hispanics who pick fruit 60 hours a week for a little off the book cash?<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe \"Help is on the Way\" slogan that was unveiled is nothing short of offensive.  Americans aren't a bunch of helpless babies waiting on the Democrats to ride in on their white horses and give us the help we need.  I think that's a serious blunder.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 border=0 align=right><tr><td width=5 rowspan=2><spacer type=block width=5 height=1><\/spacer><\/td><td width=275><img src=\"\/img\/Kerry.jpg\" width=275 aborder=0 vspace=4\/><\/td><\/tr><tr><td width=275><font face=\"verdana, arial, geneva\" size=1 color=#666666><b>Good Grief.

I play a game with myself:  Random delegate, or celebrity?  Ben Afflack, Michael Moore, and the 50 year old, overweight black woman in a business suit are easy.  But, is that semi-decrepit man the guy who played Dr. Johnny Fever on WKRP, or just a random delegate.  I read that Jerry Springer was a delegate, but I didn't see him on the cameras.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe stupidest thing that I've seen in a long time is the roll call of states giving their votes to the person at the podium.  They drag out the whole thing, as in, \"the great people of Delaware, on behalf of Secretary of State Joe Johnson, Governor Cletus Williamson, blah blah blah, and proud to be the first state to elect an African American public service commissioner (great applause), blah blah blah, and the land of beautiful salmon catching bald eagles, proudly case 12 votes for the next President of the United States, John Kerry. (great applause).<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nHonestly, I only sat through this up until the \"A\" states were done.  It was funny how ridiculous the whole process was.  I think CSPAN was the only channel showing all of this, so I really don't know why they bother with all of that silly crap.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI watched CSPAN, because it was the only place to see the full musical acts as they performed.  I didn't realize that they had good bands warm up the crowd for the speakers.  The networks and CNN might have shown a minute or two of John Cougar, Willie Nelson, or the Black Eyed Peas, but they assumed that their insight was more interesting to the viewer than the performance.\r\n"

The stage had elevators moving people up and down.  It had a long Jetson's-style dog walk that slid people from one side of the stage to the other while they sing or dance.  There was a big V-shaped catwalk that stretched out over the floor audience.  There were tons of video effects and costume changes.  There were accrobats on trapezes, and there were bagpipe players.  Fun fun fun.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nAtlanta, on the other hand, has to be added to the list of cities that I don't like.  It is a sprawling city with a nondescript skyline.  Downtown is strictly for business, all but dead on the weekend.  My current list of cities as weekend destinations looks like this:<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<table> <tr>  <td>  <p class=mainbox align=center style='text-align:center'><b>Cool Cities<\/b><\/p>  <\/td>  <td>  <p class=mainbox align=center style='text-align:center'><b>Lame Cities<\/b><\/p>  <\/td> <\/tr> <tr>  <td>  <p class=mainbox align=center style='text-align:center'>Boston<\/p>  <\/td>  <td>  <p class=mainbox align=center style='text-align:center'>Dallas<\/p>  <\/td> <\/tr> <tr>  <td>  <p class=mainbox align=center style='text-align:center'>Chicago<\/p>  <\/td>  <td>  <p class=mainbox align=center style='text-align:center'>Houston<\/p>  <\/td> <\/tr> <tr>  <td>  <p class=mainbox align=center style='text-align:center'>Seattle<\/p>  <\/td>  <td>  <p class=mainbox align=center style='text-align:center'>Atlanta<\/p>  <\/td> <\/tr> <tr>  <td><p class=mainbox align=center style='text-align:center'>San Francisco  <\/p><\/td>  <td>  <p class=mainbox align=center style='text-align:center'>Los Angeles  (although the towns <br \/>outside of LA can be cool)<\/p>  <\/td> <\/tr> <tr>  <td>  <p class=mainbox align=center style='text-align:center'>New York (as long  as you<br \/> stay in Manhattan)<\/p>  <\/td>  <td>  <p class=mainbox align=center style='text-align:center'>&nbsp;<\/p>  <\/td> <\/tr> <tr>  <td>  <\/td>  <td>  <p class=mainbox align=center style='text-align:center'>&nbsp;<\/p>  <\/td> <\/tr><\/table><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nMiami, Washington DC, and Vancouver are on the list of cities to try, and cities that I expect to be exciting.  Phoenix and Denver are suspected drags, but I haven't been to either, so I'll hold off judgment.  New Orleans and Las Vegas don't count.  They're in a league of their own.  If you think your home town belongs in that stratosphere, let me know -- but don't bother if you can't take your open drink from one building to another.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nBack to Atlanta.  There was an article in their paper one day while we were there about <a class=\"mainbox\" href=\"http:\/\/www.ajc.com\/living\/content\/epaper\/editions\/saturday\/faith_values_14101a6c669e50680028.html\" target=\"_blank\">bible study in Hooters.<\/a>  This takes place in the suburb of Kennesaw, which happens to be where Sarah (from the post just before this one) lives.  Neither Sarah nor the paper bothered to mention that Kennesaw may have the most thriving community of racist, right-wing nuts in the east.  But perhaps the Hooters group can bring a more christian attitude to town.\r\n"

Everyone who arrives at the airport is being given condoms. The article (and this was a serious article) said that \"International size condoms were being given out.

I fully expect the most awe-inducing show that I've ever seen.  I'm also pretty excited just to have a couple of days off work, and a weekend away from yard-slave laboring, even if it is just for a road trip to Atlanta.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThinking about my upcoming road trip has also reminded me of some of my other concert experiences.  \r\n<!--more--><br \/><br \/>My first concert was as a young teen-ager.  Bryan Adams.  It happened to fall on a day that I had a dentist appointment.  Apparently, the dentist had a slot or two open and had lost big in his regular poker game the night before.  He convinced my mom that now was a good day to remove a couple of wisdom teeth.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThis dentist was a real piece of work.  When he put his hands in my mouth, I could taste the grits that he had for breakfast.  I'm not making this up.  I remember it well, because I hadn't yet acquired a taste for grits.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nAt the time, I didn't really know much about wisdom teeth removal.  I understand now that you're supposed to get days of pity, and you're supposed to just lay around to convalesce and be waited on.  On the other hand, I had concert plans.  I remember going to Wendy's with all of my little friends before the show, and that eating was pretty torturous.  Not only did my mouth hurt, but I was fairly nauseous too -- probably from the pain medicine.  It actually crossed my mind at Wendy's to wuss out, have my mom come pick me up, and go home.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nInstead, I stuck with it and went to the show.  Although I tasted the blood from my mangled gums all night, it turned out that I was fine once I was there.  It also turned out to be a pretty good show.  Keep in mind, this was at least a couple of years before Bryan Adams switched to the \"all crappy ballads\" genre, so we were subjected to none of that.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nDuring most of my high school and college, I was a big classic rock fan, so most of my concerts were washed up classic rockers singing their radio hits for the millionth time, just not as well as they once had.  There is a long list of shows in this category.  I can't say I just loved any of these, but I did like most of them.  (In fact, Van Halen coming to  Biloxi has its appeal to me now.  Anyone want to go?)<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nMrs. theskinnyonbenny got me going to more varied shows before we were married.  We saw a few country music shows, Jimmy Buffet, and we were even the only ones between the ages of 10 and 50 at a Neil Diamond show at the Centroplex in Baton Rouge.  (Don't laugh -- Neil was a hoot.)  The best was probably an impromptu outdoor Tina Turner show at an amusement park.  Tina's the best.  I might write a whole entry singing her praises one day.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nMy favorites now are the big multi-act shows that they set up outside.  New Orleans has a couple of them every year, in addition to Jazz Fest.  The LSU students have been putting on a free show at the parade grounds every spring, and they have managed some really good acts out there.  I guess that puts me about one step away from being one of those geezers who goes to festivals.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI would be remiss if I didn't mention that we were supposed to be at a Madonna concert once before and had to miss it.  I don't want to jinx this trip by rehashing the details, but perhaps I'll share the store when we get back.  This one is going to be a whopper.<br \/>\r\n\r\n"

No one ever stops to whine over a bruise; they just pick themselves up and keep moving, no matter what happens.  On the other hand, I've heard Jake scream loud enough to blast paint off of a wall when he was put to bed.  And I've heard him keep this up for 30 minutes or more.  So keeping them for a weekend was certain to be an adventure.<br \/>\r\n\r\n<!--more--><br \/><br \/><table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 border=0 align=right><tr><td width=5 rowspan=2><spacer type=block width=5 height=1><\/spacer><\/td><td width=275><img src=\"\/img\/jakeannika\/HeatherAnnikaDaisy.jpg\"  width=275 aborder=0 vspace=4\/><\/td><\/tr><tr><td width=275><font face=\"verdana, arial, geneva\" size=1 color=#666666><b>A good photo of the playroom demographics.

Load cartoons on the TV, dump toys all over the floor, throw in a couple of dogs, and let the pandemonium happen naturally.  This was a good formula.  Everyone had fun, including the adults.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nOnce the small, overpopulated room made me claustrophobic, we headed out for an excursion.  We took a rain-shortened trip to the park.  Even though it was raining, Jake threw his only tantrum when we left.  It didn't last too long, though.  Then, we went to see Mike the Tiger and let the dogs run around out in the grass.  The rain stopped, so we stayed out there for a while.  Then it was to home for supper and baths.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI have to admit, I am masterful at putting kids to bed.  Like I mentioned, Jake can raise the dead screaming about bedtime, so evening had me nervous.  I started early, and gave them the option of going to bed or laying down to watch Finding Nemo without talking.  No one was crazy about the laying down and not talking rule, but the option beat going to bed.  Jake kept getting up.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n\"Do you want to go to bed?  If not, you have to lie down.\"  He would fuss a little bit, but lie down.  Anything beats going to bed, I guess.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nA cycle of squirming, talking, getting up and going back down ensued for 45 minutes or so.  I thought Jake would be the troublemaker, but he actually settled in quickly while Annika squirmed around restlessly. \"Why can't we watch the movie standing up?\" she asked.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n\"That's just the rules,\" was my grammatically challenged reply.  It's funny how automatically the most asinine parental quote jumps right out of your mouth when it's needed. <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nFinally, everyone settled in and watched quietly like they were supposed to.  Annika asked me to get up on the fold-out bed with them, so I squeezed in between her and Daisy (who was happy to lie down quietly on the bed all along).  <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nAnnika asked, \"Have I ever stayed up this late before?\"  I looked at my watch.  8:15.  Apparently, she hadn't noticed the twilight behind the blinds.  Surely the girl gets to stay up until it's dark from time to time.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n\"Yeah, I think you've probably made it this late before.\"<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 border=0 align=right><tr><td width=5 rowspan=2><spacer type=block width=5 height=1><\/spacer><\/td><td width=275><img src=\"\/img\/jakeannika\/bedtime.jpg\" height=200 width=275 aborder=0 vspace=4\/><\/td><\/tr><tr><td width=275><font face=\"verdana, arial, geneva\" size=1 color=#666666><b>You can't tell because of the flash, but this was the layout of the room when everyone had to be still and quiet.

I assured her that I was fine with that, and went downstairs to the freedom of grown-up pursuits.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe only other incident of the night was Jake screaming at 10:00.  It took me a couple minutes to realize that it wasn't cats fighting outside.  When I went up to look, he was lying on the floor, having fallen out of bed.  I guess the bars on the baby beds are more than just decorative.  I put him back in the real bed where he flailed around like a fish for a minute, and then went back to sleep.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nMrs. theskinnyonbenny woke up at 7:30 because the light and fan in our bedroom were going on and off and on and off.  Rather than rush up to protect the kids from our first poltergeist, she woke me from a nice rest.  It turns out that Jake woke up, found the remote for the upstairs ceiling fan, and was mashing the buttons to control that fan.  Who would have guessed that the same remote would control the fan and light in our bedroom?  I really should have thought of that when I installed those fans.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nSunday was short.  We had breakfast, spread toys all over everywhere, picked up toys, and then the grown-ups showed up to take the kids away.  Shortly after that, I fell asleep in my chair.<br \/>\r\n\r\n"

		"post_content" : "Mrs theskinnyonbenny and I went up to Natchitoches this weekend for the Fourth of July.  Crystal and Brent were in town with all of their kids (they're up to three of them for those who have lost count).  There's nothing too major or exciting to report, and I forgot my cameras until we were an hour out of Baton Rouge.  So all I have are a few disjointed observations.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<li>I had some small moment of concern about Louisiana's new law prohibiting open containers of alcohol.  Previously, it was illegal for the driver of a car to have an open container, but it was fine for passengers.  Now, it will also be illegal for passengers to carry open containers.  I asked the girl about this being bad for business as we picked up daiquiris at a drive through liquor store in Natchitoches.  \"No, it's not an open container, since we serve it with the lid on and don't put the straw through.\"  Well, thank goodness for that.<\/li>\r\n<!--more--><br \/><br \/><p><li>The dumbest thing that I think I saw in the last few weeks was Brent, trying to light -- no, make that actually lighting some major-pow fireworks with a hand torch.  Let's get this straight.  We have a ball of big-time explosives, wrapped in some heavy paper.  Then, instead of lighting the end of the fuse and running like hell, he's after it with a six inch flame.  My heart still races from thinking about it.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nAt one point, we went together to try to light three boxes of little screaming rockets at the same time.  He got the first two light, as I struggled to get the fuse to catch from a punk.  It didn't take me too long to run like a little girl, leaving my fuse unlit.  Brent couldn't let that box of rockets go off solo, so he went back with the torch to light my fuse.  Rockets whistled right past his head all the while.  <\/li><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<li>Did I mention that I forgot my camera?  One day, I'm going to put up a photo gallery of \"People in North Louisiana that I don't know.\"  There are some real crackerjacks in the 318 area code.  <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThat reminds me, there's a sort of new little independent newspaper in Baton Rouge called \"Tiger Weekly.\"  It's mostly concerned with campus life.  By far, the best page is the \"fashion police\" page, where they take pictures of the horribly dressed, blur out the faces, and add captions that are hilariously insulting.  That's my inspiration for the 318 gallery.<\/li><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<li>I don't see how I can lose my wallet or keys or sunglasses, and look for that type of thing for about five minutes a day.  Meanwhile, I had a bottle cap from a beer that I drank on Sunday night in my pocket all the way up through <i>yesterday evening<\/i>.  In other words, I can keep track of a piece of trash for four days straight (without finding a trash can), but I don't know where my wallet is from one minute to another.<\/li><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<li>Having Monday after the fourth off of work was nice.  Mrs. theskinnyonbenny has suddenly taken a keen interest in my canoe building and was enthusiastic about letting me work on it in the garage all day.  I know, however, that she's just ready for me to get all of that crap out of the garage.<\/li><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<li>This year's holiday was good.  I don't think I normally like July 4th all that much.  In fact, I don't remember more than a couple of July 4ths in the past 10 years.  It's just too hot to have fun this time of year.  I remember watching the Baton Rouge fireworks a couple of times, and I remember that a couple of years ago, I was just walking Daisy through the neighborhood while they were going off.  One memorable year, I was driving on the interstate, and some idiots were stopped on the I-10 bridge over the river watching from their motionless cars.  I'm sure that most of those people have weeded themselves out of the gene pool by now.<\/li>\r\n<\/p>"

Now, OLN shows us every grueling minute three times a day, so if I make the slightest effort to watch, I can catch the stage.  This year, TIVO makes it all the more viewable, since I can skip the commercials and start the viewing when I'm ready for it.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI appreciate OLN's coverage, but the announcers assume that their viewers are absolute experts on bicycle racing.  Like I mentioned, I've been watching for years, and this is the first year where I really feel like I know what's going on.  They assume that you remember from minute to minute or broadcast to broadcast which riders are on which teams, and they assume that you know the names of the top dogs on each team too.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n\r\n<!--more--><br \/><br \/><table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 border=0 align=right><tr><td width=5 rowspan=2><spacer type=block width=5 height=1><\/spacer><\/td><td width=275><img src=\"\/img\/robbiemcewen.jpg\" height=200 width=275 aborder=0 vspace=4\/><\/td><\/tr><tr><td width=275><font face=\"verdana, arial, geneva\" size=1 color=#666666><b>The stage two finish, pictured just to add a little color.<\/b><\/font><\/td><\/tr><\/table><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThey stick to the action - even though the action looks a lot alike from day to day.  That isn't a complaint.  No time gets wasted with Olympic-style profiles.  (Those things almost make me dread the doggone Olympics, but I guess I'll have the opportunity to complain about that next month.  But while I've already digressed, is there any more compelling story than the fact that all of the Olympic venues might not be ready?  That's a pretty serious embarrassment looming for Greece.)<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe few segments that they do interrupt the race to show talk about the technology.  For example, US Postal is riding bicycles whose frames weigh two pounds.  <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe nature of bicycle racing makes it difficult to televise.  Since the action happens over a hundred miles in a given day, the announcers just see what we see on the screen.  Often, this is a bouncy picture shot from a guy on a motorcycle.  At least one cameraman likes to show close ups of a wheel passing over a road.  They also like good, close shots of injuries, which tend to be bloody.  The drawback is that sometimes, an important thing happens, but there don't happen to be cameras in the area at the time.  We're treated to pictures of people picking themselves up out of a pile and brushing themselves off, without having gotten to see the wreck that put them in that place.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nIf you haven't started watching yet, the best stages are yet to come.  I like when they have to ride 120 miles per day, and have to do it through huge, steep mountains.  And the time trial at Alpe D'Huez on the 19th should be fun.  Riders will have to push individually up a steep, zigzag alpine road.  This road has been used as a brutal stage before, but this will be the first time that I've seen it used for a time trial.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI know that most of you could care less about this topic, so thanks for sticking with me to the end of the article.\r\n"

It was a little different with just the sounds of the night rather than the soundtrack that Ipod chooses for me.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nDaisy and I usually walk at 9:00.  I sometimes get asked why we walk at such an odd hour.  Well, here are the reasons:\r\n<!--more--><br \/><br \/><ol><p><li>  Usually, the after work walkers have to suffer through weather that is hotter than tarnations.  Later is cooler.<\/li><\/p><br \/>\r\n<p><li>  You wouldn't know it looking at me, but once in a while, I work out after work.  Factor in a workout, or catching up at work, or a stop at the grocery store, or something like that, fix dinner, eat, clean the kitchen, etc.  Now, it's already nine, without having had to try to delay.<\/li><\/p><br \/>\r\n<p><li>  The other foot traffic is really light that time of the night.  This means that there is that much less of the dog-tug-of-war, where two dogs pull towards each other (and the center of the street), while their humans pull and try to keep them away.  I don't care for the dog-tug-of-war.  That's just me.<\/li><\/p><br \/>\r\n<p><li>  I admit it:  since there are fewer people, I don't scoop the poop.  I know, I'm a crappy neighbor (pun unintentional).  But hey, I don't like picking up dog shit.  And hell (addressing my irate neighbors now), at least dog shit is good for your grass.  Justify the cigarette butts and potato chip wrappers you throw out your windows into my yard.<\/li><\/p><br \/>\r\n<table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 border=0 align=right><tr><td width=5 rowspan=2><spacer type=block width=5 height=1><\/spacer><\/td><td width=275><img src=\"\/img\/ourhouse.jpg\" height=200 width=275 aborder=0 vspace=4\/><\/td><\/tr><tr><td width=275><font face=\"verdana, arial, geneva\" size=1 color=#666666><b>A rather Gothic looking dog walk start and destination, as seen at 9:00 in the summertime<\/b><\/font><\/td><\/tr><\/table><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<p><li>  You know those magazine and TV advertisements where the people dance to their own sounds while listening to their Ipod?  Imagine how dumb they would look doing that in real life.  I do this.  It's fun.  And, it's best that I not be seen by a lot of others.<\/li><\/p><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nAnyway, when the music died last night, I was struck by the sounds.  The oddest one was the distant blare of a television.  I've seen movies -- usually set in the 1950s -- where people have their windows open on summer nights, and you catch faint strains of their television or radio through their screen windows.  Last night was the first time that I really heard this in real life.  I don't even remember hearing it when I was a kid.  Rain had cooled it down some, but it is still the end of June in Louisiana.  Were the people inside that cheap, or was their air conditioner broken?  I'm betting on cheap, although we may never know for sure.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe other sounds were the frogs.  There were a zillion frogs out enjoying the muddy post-rain.  The noise was loud, jumbled, crazy, from the ground, from the trees, from the whole 360 degree circle around us.  The ones from the trees sounded like two creaky chirps back to back -- like two blasts of a ray gun, or maybe like a rocking chair that squeaks at the top of the rock back.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nOne type of frog sounded like a high-pitched machine gun.  Those frogs never needed to take a breath.  Their noise just played steadily.  How could they do this?<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nAnyway, I would have never noticed any of this noise had the music kept playing.  It took an unusual act of battery negligence to get to that point, so it may be months or years before I hear what I dry night sounds like.\r\n<\/ol>"

We went last night, and I had a flash of excitement seeing the submariners from Hunt for Red October on the screen.  Wouldn't it be exciting to take those guys and make a new movie, without being constrained by a Tom Clancy plotline?  But no, it turns out that is was just Sponge Bob Square Pants, playing with a toy submarine that was causing the crew so much havoc.\r\n<!--more--><br \/><br \/>Oddly, when I laughed at the preview for fooling me, Mrs. skinnyonbenny looked at me like I had just sat on her cat.  Sure, she thought I was really laughing at Sponge Bob Square Pants, but even if I was, does that make me an evil person?<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nWe had gone to see The Stepford Wives.  There's one scene -- set in Bette Midler's house -- where you see a big TV in the background.  The show on the screen is \"Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law.\"  You have to be a pretty diligent watcher of late-night Cartoon Network to catch this show, but it's worth it when you do.  They've taken the old, crappy Hannah-Barbara superhero Birdman, and made him an attorney complete with suit (but his wings still stick out in back).  He represents other cartoon characters in trials.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe episode in Bette Midler's house was my favorite one -- Black Vulcan was suing the rest of the Superfriends for racial discrimination.  I don't remember the details, but anyone my age will recall that Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, and Aquaman got all the good capers, and the rest of the Superfriends got called in only when the whole legion of doom was scheming, or when something really, really bad was going down.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI don't know if it's true, but I suspect that they invented Superfriends, in an act of 1970's, two-dimensional affirmative action.  Outside of that show, I've never heard of Black Vulcan, Apache chief, or that Asian superhero who could turn his legs into a tornado.  I don't remember his name.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nIt's amazing how useful Aquaman turned out to be on that show.  You would think that they would just keep him on the bench, calling him in when a ship was sinking or something.  But, they always managed to work in emergencies that fish-telepathy could solve.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nOn the new Justice League cartoon, Aquaman has a makeover that would shock Clay Aiken.  All of the characters have been pumping iron since the 70s, but on top of being buff, Aquaman has long, sexy, Fabio hair.  He may have been using steroids to get bigger too, because his disposition isn't nearly as cheerful.  Maybe he's just surly because emergencies in the 2000's don't require telepathy with fish nearly as much as they did in the seventies.<br \/>\r\n\r\n"

It's important to note that I had not 6 ounces of muscle on me at that time.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nHome for Heather happened to be a working cattle farm, so occasionally, I got put to work. On this particular day, I don't recall getting any advance notice or warning that we were going to work, just a sudden invitation to take part.  <br \/>\r\n\r\n<!--more--><br \/><br \/>I most assuredly wasn't offered any sort of work boot or coverall, so I darted out in my wrinkled khaki shorts and polo shirt -- my regular uniform in the early 90s (and pretty much still what I wear now, come to think of it).<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nWe went out to a pasture to either feed a calf, or give it some kind of medicine.  I can't remember which.  If you picture a calf as a friend to the human, willingly accepting his food and medicine, then your mental image is drastically mistaken.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nInstead, we cornered the calf, and herded it into a pen with a dead end.  The process is that you brace a shoulder in a flank, and push with all your might just to keep it in place so that it can be force fed.  I think I was having fun with it right up through this part.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThings went downhill suddenly.  Out of the corner of my eye, I spotted stream of calf diarrhea shot out in a slightly upward arc. Calf diarrhea is a very distinct color.  If you picture dijon mustard, you're close.  Mix in just the smallest amount of brown and green with your dijon mustard, and you've got it.  I occasionally use \"calf-diarrhea\" to describe something else that color.    I think you can get that color in the really, really big box of Crayolas now.  (Some of you will even recall that my bathroom was briefly painted in calf diarrhea.)<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nAnyway, it squirted about like you could squirt water from between your teeth if you had a gap like Letterman.  As the calf struggled to get free, the diarrhea stream snaked around as if it had a mind of its own.  That left me doing a sort of dodge-stream dance, trying to keep it from touching my pretty-boy clothes.  At the same time, I had to keep my little bit of strength pushing the calf forward, so it wouldn't trample me in a reverse stampede.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThis went on and on.  The diarrhea would stop just long enough for me to catch my breath, and when I would let the thought that it might be over cross my mind, out would come another stream.  A couple of times, a big splosh of it came out.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe feeding ended as I neared total exhaustion.  I honestly couldn't tell you if the whole episode lasted 10 minutes or an hour, but it seems like it was closer to the hour.  I managed to get out of there with minimal damage:  some diarrhea on my shoes, and a smallish smear of it on one leg.  It could have been so much worse.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nNow that I'm locked in by marriage, I do get put to a lot more work out there than I used to.  But I haven't been invited back out to feed calves since that one time.  <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n\r\n"

Yes, there is a series of people who go to a big city and compete in Rock-Paper-Scissors.  Naturally, I'm intrigued, so I've endeavored to find out more.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nOne thing to know about me is that I think mathematically and logically.  And with that thinking, Rock-Paper-Scissors is a fair game of chance.  It should be as predictive and as fair as a coin toss, or cutting for the higher card.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nTry as I do to believe that this is the case, my real-world experience with RPS proves this to be false.  \n<!--more--><br \/><br \/>I know this because Mrs. skinnyonbenny and I use RPS to decide who does what undesirable task around the house, and time after time after time, I lose the goddamn game.  Sure two computers will play, and each will win 1\/3 of the time, lose 1\/3 of the time, and tie 1\/3 of the time.  But humans aren't computers.  We have tells.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nSo, these losers from all over have figured out that adding a human element to RPS allows you to develop strategy, read opponents, etc.  Believe me, I would be the first to scoff at this as total nonsense if I didn't lose time after time.  I've asked if I silently mouth \"P A P E R\" in slow motion as I beat my fist on my palm.  I don't think it's that obvious, but it whatever it is, it's pretty darned clear.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nFortunately for me, the group that puts on this championship takes the game pretty seriously.  They have a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.worldrps.com\/advanced.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"mainbox\">page of strategy<\/a> that I can study, and there's even a ten-dollar book coming out about RPS strategy.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nIt is rather funny how seriously the people seem to take this game.  Surely the stakes are never any more than figuring out who has to take out the trash, or which team gets the ball first in a pickup basketball game, right?  But take a look at the pictures on <a href=\"http:\/\/www.worldrps.com\" target = \"_blank\" class=\"mainbox\">http:\/\/www.worldrps.com<\/a>.  You can't tell me that these people are just a little too serious about this.  I like the captions.  Things like, \"Rock!!!\"<br \/>\n<br \/>\nAnd how about <a href=\"http:\/\/www.alltooflat.com\/serious\/adventures\/rps\/\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"mainbox\">this site?<\/a>  Notice that when you follow this link, you are under a tab called \"Serious.\"  Furthermore, tabs called \"Funny\" and \"Geeky\" are open to the author, but the Rock Paper Scissors link is under \"Serious.\"<br \/>\n<br \/>\nI need another hobby like I need a hole in the head, so no, I'm not going to start studying up.  But I would encourage any of you to look into this when you have some spare time.  Maybe you can pinch hit for me, next time I face an RPS challenge.<br \/>\n<br \/>\n\n"

So, we went to Henderson to paddle in the swamp, to see what was out there.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n\r\n<!--more--><br \/><br \/>Before paddling, we went to the Zydeco brunch at Cafe Des Amis in Breaux Bridge.  This activity was recommended by Jim, our former neighbor who can be spotted dancing at many of the local events where there is live music outdoors.  It turns out that the place is pretty happening on Saturday mornings.  There were people packed in there drinking and dancing like it was 11:00 on Saturday night.  The band and the dance floor takes up half of the cafe, and the show was pretty good.  We were about the only table not drinking.  The food can be recommended.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 border=0 align=right><tr><td width=5 rowspan=2><spacer type=block width=5 height=1><\/spacer><\/td><td width=275><img src=\"\/img\/swamppaddle.JPG\" height=200 width=275 aborder=0 vspace=4\/><\/td><\/tr><tr><td width=275><font face=\"verdana, arial, geneva\" size=1 color=#666666><b>Paddling in the swamp<\/b><\/font><\/td><\/tr><\/table><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nAfter brunch, we slid over to Henderson to launch into Henderson lake, which is part of the Atchafalaya river basin.  The basin is a big swamp, hemmed in by levees on the east and west side.  It's the marshy gunk that you cross on Interstate 10 between Baton Rouge and Lafayette.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI chose the first boat ramp that we hit, and the ground was covered in wet, rotting weeds.  Amazingly, it smelled like dead animals.  Jambalaya shop anyone?<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nWe launched on the west side, and quickly paddled to an area that is primarily moss covered Cypress trees and water hyacinth.  This is a <i>very<\/i> good paddle.  We didn't see any alligators or snakes (is that good or bad?), but there were plenty of birds.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe folks out fishing are friendly to the paddlers.  I have to admit, I did get made fun of for not knowing what duckweed was.  If you get caught in a conversation about marsh plants, just pretend like you do know duckweed.  Trust me on this one.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<table cellpadding=4 cellspacing=0 border=1 align=right><tr><td width=200 bgcolor=\"#C0C0C0\"><font face=\"verdana, arial, geneva\" size=1 color=#000000><b>Lessons Learned<\/b><ol><p><li>Bring a map and a compass.

I can see where it might get easy to get turned around out there, but we never got too far out of sight of the levee, and I figured as long as I follow the levee, I'll get back to where I started (or at least to some civilized spot).<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nComing home, we had the natural inclination to try to find some fresh fish.  I followed a signed for a seafood market, and when we found the market, it was just a metal Sears out building set up next to the people's garage.  We pushed a buzzer to get them out of the house, and spent our little bit of cash on a part of their catch.  It was pretty good catfish, although Daisy managed to knock half of it into the bushes in an unmonitored moment.<br \/>\r\n\r\n"

It turns out that stores can order as few as six pints of a particular flavor.  It seems to me that thereï¿½s no risk in ordering six pints.  If you stuck a Ben and Jerryï¿½s label on a pint of ice cream called ï¿½Cat Litter Swirl,ï¿½ you would still find six people to give it a try.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nBut Oatmeal Cookie Chunk is no Cat Litter Swirl.  It really does taste like a good oatmeal cookie, with the obligatory milk flavor already there from the sweet ice cream.  It has a good cinnamon flavor, as I recall.  Instead of raisons, it has chunks of chocolate.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nHave you ever noticed how misplaced raisons can ruin a perfectly delicious dish?  It isnï¿½t the taste ï¿½ itï¿½s the dead, fleshy texture that always take me by surprise, no matter how much your left brain tells you itï¿½s there.  Oatmeal cookies and bread pudding top my list of places where raisons donï¿½t belong.  Save them for trail mix.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nBesides all of the interesting things about how the ice cream is made, how the company was started, etc., the best thing to know about Ben and Jerryï¿½s is that the drivers of the delivery trucks will give you a free pint if you tell them itï¿½s your birthday.  The tour guides seemed to think it is okay to lie, and tell them itï¿½s your birthday just to score a free pint of ice cream.  (This strategy also worked for Barf with a Red Bull truck, but she had to lower herself and beg more than I would have expected.)<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nSo please, merchants of Baton Rouge, order six pints of Oatmeal Cookie Chunk.

		"post_content" : "I had a good time this weekend watching the Belmont Stakes.  For the archivists reading this years in the future, 2004 was the year that the 35\/1 long shot named Birdstone beat the favorite of both the bettors and the general public, Smarty Jones.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nSmarty Jones won the Kentucky Derby in the muck, then the Preakness by 11 1\/2 lengths, so it was hard to imagine him getting beat.  He went off at about 1\/5.  A truer sure thing I can't remember, but alas, it didn't work out that way.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 border=0 align=right><tr><td width=5 rowspan=2><spacer type=block width=5 height=1><\/spacer><\/td><td><img src=\"\/img\/BelmontFinish.jpg\"  aborder=0 vspace=4\/><\/td><\/tr><tr><td width=275><font face=\"verdana, arial, geneva\" size=1 color=#666666><b>A good photo of the finish, lifted without permission from <a href=\"espn.com\">ESPN.com<\/a><\/b><\/font><\/td><\/tr><\/table><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI went online today to read about Birdstone.  He's obviously a talented horse, so I wanted to read why he finished sixth (I'm relying on memory there -- it may not have been sixth, but it was somewhere back there) in the Derby.  Was he pinned in?  Was he bothered by the mud?  I'll let you know if I ever find out.  Why didn't he run in the Preakness?  Again, I don't know.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nNo, the news today was about how Smarty Jones lost.  But let's face it.  Doesn't a triple crown winner demand a better name than Smarty Jones?  Imperialism (a strong also-ran in the Derby and Preakness) would have worked.  Birdstone would have been okay too.  But Smarty Jones?  Is that the name you want to have to remember for trivia games forever?<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI read several articles about the whole thing on the internet today.  Here's something that jumps out at me.  Birdstone's owner, Marylou Whitney was described in separate articles as, \"Saratoga's leading socialite,\" and \"...nowhere near the social status of Birdstone's owner, the glamorously attired and round-voweled socialite Marylou Whitney of Saratoga Springs, N. Y.\"  <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nYet another article points out that Ms. Whitney's family has been breeding racehorses in Kentucky for three generations.  Do you think she could be a bit of a biiiitch?<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nBut for all of that, both Whitney and Edgar Prado actually <i>apologized<\/i> for winning the race.  They ruined everybody's good time and felt bad about it.  You've got to be kidding me.  They pulled the biggest upset of the decade.  They should be calling out all of the nay-sayers, saying that they knew their horse was something all along.  I truly don't understand that reaction.  Fortunately for them, Birdstone had more of a killer instinct than his owner and jockey.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 border=0 align=right><tr><td width=5 rowspan=2><spacer type=block width=5 height=1><\/spacer><\/td><td width=275><img src=\"\/img\/regulars.JPG\" height=200 width=275 aborder=0 vspace=4\/><\/td><\/tr><tr><td width=275><font face=\"verdana, arial, geneva\" size=1 color=#666666><b>Birdstone (bottom right), with a few other regulars last Christmas<\/b><\/font><\/td><\/tr><\/table><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe real story of the day was that Stacie picked Birdstone all the way.  Didn't even piddle around with a $2 bet -- she layed a whole Lincoln on him.  As the race unfolded everyone jumped up and yelled, but at the end, I think we were the only ones still up and yelling.  It's an amazing pick.  One to tell your (bored out of their minds) relatives about for the rest of your days.  I think everyone should even call her \"Birdstone\" instead of her real name for a while.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nSince this is the only place on the Internet where you can find a story about Birdstone, I'll give you my take on why he won:  he skipped the Preakness.  Three races in five weeks are a heck of a lot for horses, especially when the first of the three is run in calf-deep mud, and the last of the three is a mile and a half.  After the disappointing Derby finish, the set up Birdstone to be the long-shot spoiler all the way.  I think that they outsmarted everyone, and they certainly had the best horse on Saturday.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n\r\n"

Now, I wouldn't place money that I could name any of them.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nIt's not the corporate naming or all of the new stadium building that threw me.  I kept up with the first round of all of that without any trouble.  The problem is when corporations change names, fail, or just opt out of their naming right.  My tired old brain just couldn't add that additional variable to the mix and keep up.  For example, I know that the baseball park in Houston isn't Enron Field any more, but I don't know its new name.  And that's the nearest major league park to my home.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI guess that more and more, my brain is acting like an old person's, and that's trouble.  It used to bother me that my mom could hear the title \"Farris Bueller's Day Off\" a thousand times, but still say it back as \"Farris Wheeler Takes a Day Off.\"  <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI do still manage some retention after something is repeated fifty times or so.  Next week, a new edition of \"The Amazing Race\" is going to start.  I can tell that this is the year that I don't call it something like \"The Big Race\" or \"The Great Race\" or -- completely giving up on getting it right -- \"The Superlative Race.\"<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nBut enough about me.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nKeeping track of these stadiums is a lot tougher now.  Which city has United Center and which has American Airlines Center?  Which has American Airlines Arena?  Wrigley field in Chicago is really named after Mr. Wrigley rather than the chewing gum company that he also started.  Ericsson field is named after a Skandinavian company rather than a guy named Ericsson.  Who could possibly keep all of that straight?  (For answers, check <br \/>\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.leagueoffans.org\/nbanamingrights.html\">www.leagueoffans.org<\/a>)<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI'm not sure what Louisiana is waiting for, when it comes to naming the Superdome and the New Orleans Arena.  Clearly, corporate naming is in the future.  (When you go with \"New Orleans Arena,\" I know that you didn't really even try.)  I suspect that the airlines, mobile phone companies, and other industry giants have lost that skill that was once so necessary in business:  paying off politicians.  <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nSee, they've gotten used to states where they just pay their millions and issue a press release.  They don't send the guy here for \"negotiations\" where the bag full of Benjamins hits the governor's leg under the table.  I bet that there are lots of people sitting in posh conference rooms who are just baffled about why their negotiations with Louisiana aren't going any better.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n\r\n"

You mean to tell me that an more active season is the same liklihood as a less active season?  In other words, that they don't have a clue as to what might happen?  And I'm supposed to run out and buy extra batteries and bottled water?<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI love the frenzy to buy bottled water and batteries every time a hurricane nears our area.  The supermarket shelves will be emptied of both.  I'm convinced that people who never drink water buy several bottles, and that people buy AAA batteries without knowing what appliance requires them.  Won't they be surprised when the hurricane comes, they change the batteries in their TV remote controls, and they aren't magically transferred to a safer, calmer environment.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe ideal hurricane is just strong enough to provide some impressive weather, shut off the power for the day, pull down some limbs, and keep you home from work.  It can't do any real, serious damage, but it still has to get the office to close down, just in case.  It's a tall order for any weather phenomena, and my hat is off to God when he pulls off the ideal hurricane.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nIn other news that I saw this weekend, some Louisiana legislators want to end the homestead exemption (which provides a small part of residential property value to be free from property tax) for homeowners who aren't married.  I wish those legislators would just call a spade a spade:  introduce some legislation that requires homosexuals to pay more property tax.  That opens the door for anything that people do behind their own doors to be taxes, as long as the politicians find it objectionable.  Like playing strip poker?  Here's a bill for extra property tax.  Drinking wine on Sunday?  That's fine, but you'll have to pay a little more tax.  Have a tendency to eat potted meat?  That'll just be an extra $200 for the state.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nOne thing that they don't object to is chicken fights.  I'm not sure why this comes up during Louisiana legislative sessions every few years.  Every time, the national media run a little snippet of filler about Louisiana and chicken fights.  This is the same national media that entirely ignored the fact that we had a second serial killer in Baton Rouge, and were, in fact living in a city with two serial killers at once.  What's wrong with these people?<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nOne last news item from this weekend's paper deserves note:  a Prairieville man got pulled over and received a DWI from a deputy.  Two hours later, he drove by the same deputy at the same intersection, still drunk off his fanny.  Got a second offence DWI just a couple of hours after the first offence DWI.  The guy was probably a newscaster.<br \/>\r\n\r\n"

Every time I try to write down the list, I come up with two really legitimate entries, and some random lame filler entries.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe second-worst smelling place in Baton Rouge is the short hall between the swimming pools and the men's locker room at the North Foster YMCA.  Sure, all gyms stink, and an old YMCA should be expected to smell really foul.  But this one stretch is much much worse then the rest of the YMCA bouquet that permeates the building.  It's just a few feet, but the smell is of very, very strong body odor.  I don't know who has body odor coming out of the swimming pool, but whatever bacteria broth is brewing on the unventilated floor has that same smell.  But worse.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 border=0 align=right><tr><td width=5 rowspan=2><spacer type=block width=5 height=1><\/spacer><\/td><td width=275><img src=\"\/img\/jambalayashop.JPG\" height=200 width=275 aborder=0 vspace=4\/><\/td><\/tr><tr><td width=275><font face=\"verdana, arial, geneva\" size=1 color=#666666><b>Jambalya Shop on Government Street<\/b><\/font><\/td><\/tr><\/table><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nBut even worse than this is the spot on Government Street outside of Jambalaya Shop early on some (but not every) mornings.  A lot of times, the spot just smells fine.  Today, in fact, it had sort of a nice, spicy, sizzling vegetable kind of smell.  But other mornings, I'm just positive that I've caught them while they are boiling the skin and fur off of the previous night's road kill.  I may only be at the stop light for a minute or two, but the sense of death and rot is overwhelming.  I can't see how they have any business at all, other than that there might be people who never happened to drive by at 7:30 in the morning.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI've eaten a Jambalaya Shop a few times, and I never thought their food was very good.  The jambalaya is too dry and is too overwhelmingly rice, and the gumbo is pure grease.

I'm sure it's still booming at 2:00 am, but at my age, we go there for breakfast.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nSurprisingly, the weekday morning crowd is businessmen.  They are there any time up until 9:00 on weekdays, reading their papers.  There's even a Wall Street Journal highbrow or two.  It's almost entirely men.  This morning, there were a dozen customers, and only one was female (and even that designation is questionable).<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe food is 90% grease, with just enough organic matter that you can distinguish whets on your plate -- say eggs from potatoes.

He doesn't shut up the whole time you're there, and every utterance is hilarious.  If he has no one to talk to, he just talks to himself.  My sister is even a little frightened of him.  At one point, I heard him muttering about Saratoga, which I thought was odd, until I realized he had read the word on my hat.  <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nYou're pretty much stuck listening to his random thoughts.  I've never heard him mention a sporting event or something from the news.  His topic when I sat down was the Brady Bunch.  (Actually, it was the worst songs ever recorded, which led quickly to the Brady Bunch.)  \"Anyone who says they weren't checking out Marsha Brady is lying.  Anyone who says they were checking out Cindy is a pervert.\"  Well, um, what if I was six when I was checking out Cindy?<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nIf you were in college during the 80s or 90s, Louie's is no cleaner then you remember.  The dirtiness is probably the biggest gripe that people might have with Louie's, but I don't think the food would be as good if the restaurant were clean.  Of course, it wouldn't give you the trots for two days if your bacteria tolerance is low either.  <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nBut hereï¿½s my only complaint about the cleanliness:  after I used the bathroom and pulled up my pants this morning, there was a big spot on the leg that was soaking wet.

I'll make it short: Starts off I was riding my bike(don't know why I was riding a bike since I don't own one)in downtown BR on my way to a parade and I decided to ride to the end of the parade route and wait there for the floats when I see all 3 of y'all.I park my bike in this apartment complex(in some laundry room).Go out enjoy the parade...everything is normal so far.Parade is over and we decide to get a drink at some bar but stacie wants to puts the beads away and it just so happens that the apartment complex were my bike is parked is where she lives.So ben\/Heather go to the bar and I walk Stacie back to her apartment to put the beads away and I go get my bike.On my way to the bike I get lost and basically half of my dream is centered around me finding my bike except towards the middle of the dream I notice all 3 of y'all are now midgets(with really big heads) and are trying to kill me(I couldn't figure out with what though).So a vicious chase ensues.This seemed like it lasted forever and was really the highlight of the whole dream.During the whole chase sequence all 3 of y'all where yelling things at me that freaked me out which made me more frantic in the dream. Well, the chase ends in this big parking lot.. a small fight takes place and the dream is over. <\/blockquote><br \/>\n<br \/>\nI intended to conclude with a picture of my head blown up and pasted on a midget, but google \"midget picture\" and see what you get.

		"post_content" : "Work conversation this morning included an allusion to Long Duck Dong before 9:00 am.  That's bodes well for your day.  I'm inspired to share some pop culture observations.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI suppose I should start with American Idol.  For the second time in five or six weeks, one of the best singers was voted off while lesser talent was left to entertain us for another week.  I have to admit that I was pretty bent when the results came out last night.  <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nIf you still share that irritation, think again.  Sure it would be all right to have a final three of really, really good singers (it should probably be the three black chicks, if you ask me).  But, then we would have been deprived of seeing the girl on Wednesday cry on live TV as the judges told her she wasn't good enough.  <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nAnd we wouldn't have gotten to see her cry the next night as she realized that her tears kept her on and got a better singer booted.  <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nAnd most importantly, we wouldn't have gotten to see a room full of grown-up music fans loudly boo a cute, young, enthusiastic girl who was <i>crying<\/i>.  Where else are you going to see that?<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nWhile I'm on the subject of Reality TV, I will admit that for a couple of weeks, I've been trying to work in a clever Omarosa reference.  Some like, \"as courageous as Omarosa when the sheet rock starts crumbling.\"  Never could fit it in, and Omarosa has pretty much passed from cultural relevance.  Darn.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nOn a completely different subject, the Vanity Fair just came in the mail yesterday.  I know when it's Vanity Fair days because Mrs. skinnyonbenny barely speaks to me with that nose in the magazine.  Tonight, I asked her what she was reading about.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n\"Bill Clinton\"<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nWhat about him?<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n\"How he's a philandering doofus.\"<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nIf the Vanity Fair writers have discovered a fresh spin for the \"Bill Clinton, philandering doofus\" story, then they are very good writers indeed.  I'll have to pick up that magazine and try to read an article or two one of these days.  <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nChanging subjects again, I am not really all that geeked about the summer blockbusters that I've seen advertised so far.  I am a lot more excited about the first time release of the original Japanese Godzilla in the U.S.  Unfortunately, there's almost no chance that it will carried in Baton Rouge.  If there's anything we get less than foreign language movies, it's re-releases of classic movies.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nJust so you aren't left wondering, the conversation this morning was about how mean a particular client is.  I call her \"tbj\" where t and b stand for \"that bitch,\" and j isher first initial.  Eric -- the main support guy -- made the astute observation that she looks a lot like Long Duck Dong's prom date.  There.  Now you don't have to wonder.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nAgree?  Disagree?  I've decided to keep the bulletin board around.  Let us know what you think in <a href=\"http:\/\/theskinnyonbenny.com\/stl-web\/bulletin\/bb\/viewforum.php?f=1\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"mainbox\">the pop culture forum.<\/a>\r\n"

I've walked, driven, and cycled around the lakes countless times.  I've seen them smooth as glass and frothy with whitecaps, teeming with wildlife, and covered with rotting dead fish.  These little lakes can give you anything.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe urban legend is that someone way back in the ignorant days (it varies with the telling) didn't want Southern University to be built on a site next to LSU, so they had lakes dug instead.  This could be true:  the only web site that Google found me with a history of the LSU lakes was in the .lsu.edu domain, but the web page had been pulled out of publication.  And it is really shallow.  More on that in a bit.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nAmazingly, the search for \"LSU lakes\" returned 27,000 hits.  Of course there are some false alarms in there, but hell, that's one page for every 10 people in town.  There are just a heck of a lot of people photographing and writing about these little ponds.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nOne result of my search caught my eye.  This is from a site with transcripts from our local news on channel 2.  <a href=\"http:\/\/www.2theadvocate.com\/scripts\/042104\/ten.htm\" target=\"top\" class =\"mainbox\">(Here's the original page.)<\/a><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<blockquote>THE L-S-U LAKES ARE A POPLUAR PLACE TO JOG, RIDE BIKES AND EVEN FISH. BUT APPARENTLY. THERE'S AN ALLIGATOR THAT'S TAKEN UP RESIDENCE AT THE LAKES ON DALRYMPLE. VERONICA MOSGROVE JOINS US FROM THE LAKES. VERONICA. WE'RE USED TO GATORS IN SWAMPS. BUT HOW COMMON IS IT FOR A GATOR TO HANG OUT IN THE CITY???<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nWELL, NOT TOO COMMON.BUT WE HAVE TO REMEMBER. THIS IS SOUTH LOUISIANA. AND I'M TOLD GATORS CAN FIND THEIR WAY TO ALMOST ANY BODY OF WATER....<\/blockquote><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI will be the first to attest that regular Channel 2 viewers might need to be reminded from time to time which state they live in.  I swear, our local news is so asinine, I could spit.  You wouldn't believe the irate rant that I edited out of this post.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 border=0 align=right><tr><td width=5 rowspan=2><spacer type=block width=5 height=1><\/spacer><\/td><td width=275><img src=\"\/img\/Heather-kayak.JPG\" height=200 width=275 aborder=0 vspace=4\/><\/td><\/tr><tr><td width=275><font face=\"verdana, arial, geneva\" size=1 color=#666666><b>Zooming across the lake.<\/b><\/font><\/td><\/tr><\/table><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nRecently, Mrs. skinnyonbenny and I started kayaking on the bigger LSU lake for a light workout in the evenings.  As much time as I have spent around the lake, the perspective is different in the middle.  I would think to myself, \"paddle over to the spot with the cypress knees where the big white geese hang out,\" and it would take a little bit of searching to find that point.  This was a complete surprise.  I thought that every spot would be visible and easy  to find.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI had often noticed that you could look into the lake from time to time, and see a bird standing in ankle-deep water out in the middle.  Once you get out there, you see that stumps are plentiful.  And even when you are 10-20 yards from shore, you might be in water a foot or so deep.  This isn't the lake to use when you are trying to sink a dead body.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n\r\n"

I'm not sure about other parts of the country, but at least in my town, Cinco de Mayo celebrations were started by Corona advertising, and local Mexican restaurants jumping on the bandwagon with specials.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe make-a-holliday-for-profit method appears to have worked.  There was nary a seat to be found in the first three Mexican places I passed today.  Then, we went to one which had plenty of open seats, despite the false claim of a mariachi band.  Let me just tell you, pulling into an empty parking lot at a Mexican restaurant does not give you the feeling that you are about to enjoy a great meal.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nMost people that I polled thought that May 5 is the Mexican independence day.  As it turns out, they're wrong.  <a href=\"http:\/\/www.vivacincodemayo.org\/history.htm\" class=\"mainbox\">Vivacincodemayo.org<\/a> explains what it's all about, although I confess to not having the patience to read the darned page.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nWhile I was google searching for that history, I also tried to find out if a mushroom is a vegetable.  Here's my verdict:  it isn't.  Out of my sense of fairness, here are my arguments for both sides of the issue.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<table width=\"100%\" border=\"2\" frame=\"box\" rules=\"all\"><tr><td width=\"50%\" align=\"center\" class=\"mainbox\"><b>Is<\/b><\/td><td width=\"50%\" align=\"center\" class=\"mainbox\"><b>Is Not<\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td width=\"50%\" class=\"mainbox\" valign=\"top\">People who know such things seem to have decided that fungi are not plants.  At least one definition of \"vegetable\" indicates that it is a plant.  A mushroom is definitely a fungus.  Since it isn't a plant, it can't be a vegetable.<\/td><td width=\"50%\" class=\"mainbox\">Cream of mushroom soup is often in recipes for things like \"vegetable casserole.\"  Also, defining something as a vegetable is a food category.  It has nothing to do with the scientific, biological, egg-head garbage that distinguishes a fungus from a plant.  No lay person knows what a fungus is anyway.  They seem to just be mushrooms and nasty things that you want to scrape away.<\/td><\/tr><\/table><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nAs I often do, I've changed my mind since writing the first sentence.  The most contrived of American holidays is Valentine's Day.  But more on that in February, if I remember.\r\n"

Tip off at 7:00 in New Orleans arena, followed by the LSU-Tulane baseball game next door in the Superdome.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 border=0 align=right><tr><td width=5 rowspan=2><spacer type=block width=5 height=1><\/spacer><\/td><td width=275><img src=\"\/img\/courtside0427.JPG\" height=200 width=275 aborder=0 vspace=4\/><\/td><\/tr><tr><td width=275><font face=\"verdana, arial, geneva\" size=1 color=#666666><b>Being close to the basketball court is good.<\/b><\/font><\/td><\/tr><\/table><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe basketball game was great.  We had seats on the 10th row in the corner.  I could get used to the lower deck.  My only real problem with it is that the New Orleans fans sit on their asses during the action.  They are more apt to get up to do the chicken dance during a timeout than they are to stand up and try to rattle the opponents.  I know that the NBA is new to us, but come on.  This is the playoffs.  It's time to start acting like the loud obnoxious a-holes that we are.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThat reminds me of a story.  A couple of years ago, I was at a hockey game in Baton Rouge.  It was a week night, and there weren't too many people there.  There was one guy in a suit seated near us who was at the game after work by himself.  He seemed to enjoy the game, without being noticeable or rowdy.  He was reading the newspaper during time outs.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nBut when the chicken dance started, the guy calmly folded up his paper, put it away, stood up, and started shaking his ass.  He really got into it -- smiling, doing gyrations, and all.  At the end of the music, he went immediately back to a serious face, sat down, unfolded the paper, and started reading.  You have to wonder if he was hypnotized and whether he even knows that he did all of that dancing.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nBut I digress...<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nCall me a geek, but twice during the basketball game, the Hornets made passes that were so beautiful, I got chills.  In the first half, David West (no mistake), threaded the needle from the free throw line to an open teammate under the basket.  It's a testament to the beauty of the assist that I have no idea who actually scored the basket.  In the second half, West (go figure) was on the receiving end of a Baron Davis pass.  Excellent.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nYou can't beat a 300-yard walk from one event to the next.  The setup was like Jazz fest for the Louisiana sports fan.  It's a little bit difficult, though to get from basketball fan mode to baseball fan mode.  It sounds stupid, but I not knew what to yell.  Once I did even blurt a \"c'mon ref!\"  No one seemed to notice that I didn't know that baseball has umpires.  The basketball and baseball centers of the brain are surprisingly far from each other.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 border=0 align=right><tr><td width=5 rowspan=2><spacer type=block width=5 height=1><\/spacer><\/td><td width=275><img src=\"\/img\/AtBaseBall0427.JPG\" height=200 width=275 aborder=0 vspace=4\/><\/td><\/tr><tr><td width=275><font face=\"verdana, arial, geneva\" size=1 color=#666666><b>The narrator watches baseball.<\/b><\/font><\/td><\/tr><\/table><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe baseball game was moved up to an earlier than expected start for the typical LSU baseball fan, who is around age 80.

I know that it's my site, and that I don't have to publish this, but I sure as hell would put the same photo of any of you here, so in the name of journalistic integrity, here is the photo that Stacie titled, \"7th Inning Stretch.\"<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 border=0 align=center><tr><td width=5 rowspan=2><spacer type=block width=5 height=1><\/spacer><\/td><td width=100%><img src=\"\/img\/7thInningStretch.JPG\" height=200 width=275 aborder=0 vspace=4\/><\/td><\/tr><tr><td width=275><font face=\"verdana, arial, geneva\" size=1 color=#666666><b>7th Inning Stretch <\/b><\/font><\/td><\/tr><\/table><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nIn the three innings of baseball that we caught, LSU only managed one hit, and they gave up a few.  Fortunately, they had built a big lead by the time we got there, so we managed to leave with a 2-0 record on the night.  That's a pretty good night, and by all reasonable measures, we should have headed straight for the casino, but like responsible grown-ups, we headed back to Baton Rouge.<br \/>\r\n\r\n"

And since I have nothing else to tell you all about, allow me share some complaints.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<b>NFL Draft<\/b><br \/>\r\nFrom one year to the next, I forget just how boring the NFL draft is.  I can't imagine that each team really needs fifteen minutes in the first round.  I'm sure they all go into the first round knowing two or three things that they are likely to do, given which players are available.  It would make more sense that they get a long time in the late rounds, when they might have to look back through some notes to remember who those players were.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nOne of the local stations should do a draft highlight show, which would do nothing other than focus on which LSU players were drafted and by who, and give us a little highlight reel for each of the Saints draft picks.  That's all the locals really care about, and currently, they have to sit through 2 days of ESPN talking heads to get that info.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<b>Speed TV<\/b><br \/>\r\nSpeed TV finally abandoned their experiment to show Speed Racer at night.  <br \/>\r\nIt's clear to me that none of the executives at that network ever screened an episode of SR before deciding to run it.  It isn't a mindless fast car, lots of crashes type of show that would appeal to the Bubbas watching Speed TV.  It is a somewhat frightening, poorly animated, thinking-man's cartoon.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nIn fact, I can't think of a more disturbing cartoon.  That little kid who follows around the main characters absolutely gives me the willies.  Who ever liked this cartoon in the first place?<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe better 70s era Japanese cartoon was G-Force.  I haven't ever seen G-Force reruns on any channel, and I haven't run across the DVD set either.  I may be the only one who remembers this cartoon.  It shares the almost motionless\/bug eyed character style of animation, but for some reason, I don't remember it as being quite so strange.  In fact, Thundercats are just a rich man's G-Force, except that they don't have to change into their super hero suits, and they are dressed up like cats rather than like birds.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nSpeed Racer never had a chance against Family Guy and Futurama on Cartoon Network.  Those two are really good, except that they each only have 20-40 episodes, it seems.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<b>This season's American Idol<\/b><br \/>\r\nLast week's vote-off of the Jennifer chick really raised some ire in theskinnyonbenny household.  She <i>was<\/i> one of the two or three best singers the last couple of weeks.  I was pretty annoyed about it myself.  In fact, just thinking about it now makes me want to spit on my keyboard.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nNotice this too:  every time someone finishes second-to-last, they are safe the following week.  Good news for Fantasia, who should clearly take charge of the competition at this point.  If she gets voted off, I'm going to be really bitter.<br \/>\r\n\r\n"

The big jar that I picked up happened to be sauerkraut.<br \/>\r\n<table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 border=0 align=right><tr><td width=5 rowspan=2><spacer type=block width=5 height=1><\/spacer><\/td><td width=275><img src=\"\/img\/jartop.JPG\" height=200 width=275 aborder=0 vspace=4\/><\/td><\/tr><tr><td width=275 class=\"caption\">Can someone interpret K07301B 07:36 for me?  How long is this jar of kraut good?<\/td><\/tr><\/table><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nIt just so happens that I don't remember the last time I bought or even ate sauerkraut.  I used to buy it a lot to put on a bun with a big sausage.  But, it's been a couple of years since I regularly ate sausage.  Could this bottle be that old? <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThis reminded me of the seemingly unrelated fact that Crystal and Brent are coming to visit in July.  The link that brought this memory to the forefront is that every time Crystal visits, she checks the jars in the refrigerator and finds something that is expired.  If you don't know Crystal, your reaction must certainly be, \"What kind of psychopath is this chick?\"  But in fact, she is really very normal.  From time to time, she can even have a stretch where you would describe her as charming.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nCrystal doesn't just find the jar of expired jelly or mayonnaise or whatever.  She bides her time and waits.  Eventually, she finds an opening where she can slip jelly or mayonnaise or bottles into the conversation, and then land a statement like, \"Well, I wasn't going to say anything, but since we're talking about mayonnaise, there's an expired jar of it in the refrigerator now.\"  Actually, it doesn't come across that forced.  She is very talented at this little diversion.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nAnd lest you think that I'm exaggerating, I distinctly remember Crystal doing this twice, which means that in reality, she must have done this lots more.  This isn't normally the sort of behavior that I would remember from one year to another, so it must have been repeated over and over.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nIf you don't mind, I need a couple of emails from my readers.  I need one person to drop me a note at the end of June, reminding me to clean all of the expired crud out of my refrigerator.  I also need someone who works for the sauerkraut plant to send me a message decoding that stamp on the bottle, and let me know how much longer this stuff is good.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nUntil then, the sauerkraut stays on the refrigerator door.<br \/>\r\n\r\n"

But, it's one of those things where a question pops into mind, then lingers and grows and puzzles the brain for months and months.  It's like the question about how the Saints can suck for 30 years in a row or why you can't wait to get back to Las Vegas, even though you know you're just going to end up hung over and without your money.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe question is this:  where are all of the stray pubic hairs in the APPRO men's room coming from?  Every morning, the urinals are nice and clean.  By every afternoon, there is at least one hair per urinal, and on occasion, I've seen as many as four or five.  As far as I know, I'm not losing pubic hair.  I've never seen a stray lingering around my home toilet.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<ol><br \/>\r\n<li>  Is there a male balding pattern that also applies to that down-below region?

I was in a stall this morning, and when I turned to unroll some toilet paper, the roll was a new one.  It was stuck together in that new-roll fashion, and it looked like it had been clawed by a rat.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nOf course, the rodent-like tattering was the result of a person's unsuccessful attempt to get the paper free.  The frightening part is that the person tried to get that paper free, but then gave up on the idea.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nYuck.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n\r\n"

This was notably my first time to swim in the Indian Ocean, although there's no real difference between the Indian Ocean vs. the Atlantic or Pacific.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThere really isn't too much narrative information to post about Krabe.  The pictures will play well once I get them on line, but the time was spent swimming, snorkeling, eating, and drinking, for the most part.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThere were a few sailboats in the area, but not too many.  I suppose that Thailand is fairly out of the way for those that cruise around the world, but I think it is probably worth a stop.  There appeared to be very good anchorages, and the water was always calm in the days that we were there.  Prices were right.  I had a tuna sandwich, large plate of fries, and three beers for the equivalent of $4 and change.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe topography was unlike any I've seen.  Islands tend to be huge limestone towers, which jut up steeply from the water.  Kayaking through them was like hiking through a canyon.  There were spots where cliffs with stalactites hung down over the kayak menacingly.  There were also caves that you could float right into, but for some reason, it was just too creepy (not to mention potentially dangerous) to go into them alone.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nHere's one amusing story:  The place that we stayed had one of those bars that you could swim up and order food and drinks.  Mom went up the last afternoon and ordered an ice cream sundae, which of course, Americans pronounce \"sun-di.\"  The Thai bartender looked puzzled.  Mom repeated the order, and he continued to not understand.  When she pointed it out on the menu, he actually corrected her English:  \"That's Sun-Day.\"<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe other amusing thing that I wanted to point out is that the Thai word for \"cat\" is \"meow.\"  How perfect is that?  It's like their Webster equivalent went ahead and asked a cat, \"What kind of animal are you?\"  Unfortunately, the word for dog is not \"woof,\" and the word for elephant is not \"aarannnnngh.\"<br \/>\r\n\r\n"

		"post_content" : "Somewhere between when the time when the Thai ladies were trying on Mom's fake boob and when the weird little guy put a hot towel <i>while<\/i> I was urinating, I knew it was time to go home.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nBut I jump ahead in the story.  We started out on Sunday night at an outdoor bar on the 60th floor of one of the high rises.  You couldn't exactly say that we saw the sunset, but we were there as the haze faded from white, to pink, to dark blue, then to black.  I don't remember the name of the hotel, but if you're ever here, just ask your concierge where the outside bar on the 60th floor is.  He'll know.  It's a nice place, that's worth a trip.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nFrom there, we went to a place with blues music and a hamburger\/barbecue type of menu.  <br \/>\r\n  We talked to a couple of band members during a break -- one guy was Scottish, the other was from northern Mississippi.  The latter was one of those guys that you meet who instantly starts telling you some personal details about his life way too early in the acquaintanceship.  Why do people do this?<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nFrom there, we headed to another bar in Pat-Pong.  This was just across and down the street from the famous Super Pussy establishment, but you couldnï¿½t see the SP because of all of the vendors.  I hadnï¿½t realized that there were non-dirty establishments on that street, but there are, and the one we went to even had some families in there.  We went to this bar in Pat-Pong to see a sort of Elvis-looking performer.  The band was entertaining, led by this chubby Thai Elvis with sideburns who didnï¿½t sing any Elvis tunes, but had the hip shaking bit down pretty well.  I had a good laugh, and was able to shoot some video footage.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe last stop was a bar a couple of streets down from my parents, where they are regular enough to be well known by the staff.  It is a stifling hot place, with a band in the corner.  They keep the drinks coming for you, but give you a hard time if the necessity of not dropping dead from dehydration compels you to order water between every few beers.  Mom has become very popular with the staff, and this was her first visit back since her surgery.  Several waitresses pulled up stools to our table, and spent the evening sitting there with us, getting up only to bring more drinks to the table.  <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nSo that brings us to the try-out of Momï¿½s boob.  She calls the fake one ï¿½Swell,ï¿½ which in Momï¿½s accent is pronounced ï¿½Sway-ull.ï¿½  She let the waitresses give it a go, so that they could see what it might be like to have three breasts.  Iï¿½m not sure they came to a consensus about the best place for a third breast.  Fortunately, I was playing pool with Dad and didnï¿½t have to witness this for myself.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nDad took the opportunity about this time to get the hell out of Dodge.  <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nIt was right after that when I was standing at a urinal (in the uni-sex bathroom, doing my own thing.  For some reason, the bathroom attendant walked up behind me and placed a hot towel on the back of my already sweaty, hot neck.  Talk about something that will dry you up in heartbeat.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nWhen something like this happens to you, your immediate reaction is to want to push the guy away.  The problem is that your wiener is still sticking through the zipper hanging out there in the open, so you canï¿½t really turn around.  I had to make do with, ï¿½NoNoNoNoNoNo.ï¿½  He went away.  By the time I got the liquid flowing, got zipped up, and turned around, he was nowhere to be seen.  I think that was best for both of us.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nWhen I reported this incident back at the table, Mom actually asked if I had tipped him.  <i>Tipped him.<\/i>  Youï¿½ve got to be kidding me.  Iï¿½m still indignant about that suggestion.  <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nSinging and drinking continued for a few more hours.  Unlike my last trip here, bars in Bangkok have to close at 2:00 now.  Let me just say, thank God for that.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n\r\n"

		"post_content" : "On Friday, Mom and I traveled to Ayuthaya province.  This is about an hour outside of Bangkok, and was the capital up until about a thousand years ago.  We started by touring ruins of a complex that may have been the palace or a temple.  The ruins were pretty neat.  It was much like touring an old fort in America in terms of how it looked.  But obviously, the Thai's cement was a better mix than that of the American pioneers, since it was still holding strong, despite the handicap of an extra thousand years or so of exposure.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nHad it not been so hot, the ruins would have been a great place to run and play hide-and-seek.  I honestly had a little hide-and-seek fantasy while I toured, and had there been any children anywhere near, maybe we could have pulled it off.  There really weren't too many people out there, and of those that were, I was the youngest to the extent that Mom was probably second youngest.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nAfter the ruins, we went to visit a palace that is still kept up.  The grounds were really nice, and I enjoyed my visit without going into any buildings at all.  We splurged, and toured the grounds by golf cart.  It was very nice, and I will post some video of the place once I get home.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nFriday night:  we went to a new night market, but it wasn't all that exciting.  The excitement of the Thai markets is that you are packed into a small space with a zillion people in excruciating heat with no air conditioning.  While this market didn't have air conditioning, it was spacious and not crowded.  Not much different from an American flea market really.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nSaturday morning:  Dad and I went to breakfast near by and then walked to an antique store.  All of the furniture was wood.  A store employee and a kid were outside refinishing some pieces.  They had nice stuff, and the prices are ridiculously low by our standards.  I entertained a fantasy of being an importer, until we left.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nSaturday night:  We went on a dinner cruise up the river that goes through downtown Bangkok.  It was a nice evening; the breeze kept it comfortable, and the food was pretty good.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe next thing on the agenda is a massage, which starts in half an hour.<br \/>\r\n\r\n"

		"post_content" : "Being in Bangkok the second time is very different than being here for the first time.  It isn't the city that has changed; it's just that the overwhelming sensation on the first visit is how very different and strange everything is.  Now, the chaos seems familiar and natural.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nWe have only done a couple of things around the town.  The main thing was to go order and get fitted for custom clothes.  The proprietor of the store is a very nice Indian guy naked Victor.  Victor runs a store that is very popular with the Americans, and he is very proud of his known-name clients.  He has framed pictures on the wall of himself with notable clients -- mostly from the families of both Bush presidents. He told me that Tom Ridge had been there a couple of weeks before, and showed me the picture of ol' Tommy, which hadn't been framed or put on the wall yet.  <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nWhen I went back for my follow-up fitting yesterday, I made Victor take a picture with me.  I'm going to mail him a big glossy copy so that he can have a political independent on the wall with the rest of those guys.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThere are two main reasons for the popularity:  <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n1)  Victor is a great retailer.  He greets every customer by name as they walk in.  Apparently, he remembers names of people who haven't been in for years and years.  <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n2)  The custom clothes can't be beat.  He uses extremely nice fabric, and the fit is amazing.  I had a fitting yesterday, where my suit was held together by straight pins, and -- I hate to be vain in my web log -- but I looked awesome.  I have got to find an opportunity to wear a suit soon.  <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nVictor is making me a suit with a second pair of pants, a sport coat, two dress shirts, and two pair of cotton trousers.  He's also making Heather eight shirts.  All of this is going to be ready 3 days from when we placed the order.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nAnother thing that we did out in the city is visit the <a HREF=\"http:\/\/www.jimthompsonhouse.com\/\" class=\"mainbox\">Jim Thompson House<\/a>.  This is one of those tourist areas that everyone should see, but we didn't make it there on the last trip.  It was okay -- very pretty to be sure, but I can't say that I was up for a museum.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe only other thing we did in town was to visit a small fertility park.  This thing was only the size of a very small playground, but it has a shrine to Buddha, and about a hundred statues of penises.  Some of those were really weird.  There was a cat laying under Buddhaï¿½s shrine with huge balls hanging from between hi legs, so apparently, the fertility part of it works.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe Thais have a small shrine to Buddha in front of most buildings.  People leave food in front of it as an offering, and they stop at them to burn incense and pray.  At this park, a good number of things had been left for Buddha, including a bottle of red cream soda, and about six cigarettes.  I hadn't known that Buddha was a smoker.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe food that we've eaten has been very good.  We ate at a couple of restaurants that were excellent.  I am keeping up with what I eat, because I predicted to Heather that she would eat better than me while I'm out.  She is supposed to be keeping up with a similar list.  I'm really going to have to whine for the \"cheese biscuit mix\" that Mom had me bring to bring me back to level.  I will post a page with our comparative food logs when I get home.<br \/>\r\n\r\n"

It was a good 27 hours from the time I arrived at the Baton Rouge airport until I got into the car to go to my parents' place.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe long flight was from Atlanta to Seoul.  Fifteen hours from takeoff to landing.  I thought of this as the Summer Olympic route, since those cities hosted the last two.  They should go ahead and route the flight from Seoul to Athens, and then from Athens back to Atlanta and promote the Summer Olympic gimmick.  Some fool or other would take it the whole route.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI couldn't get a window seat on this flight, and I was disappointed not to have a personal video screen on the back of the seat in front of me.  However, I had an aisle, and no one in the seat next to me, so it wasn't too bad.  I fell asleep immediately.  I seem to have a real strange knack for dropping off during taxi and takeoff.  It makes some people nervous, but relaxes me to the point that there's no staying awake.  I know it's strange, but it happens all the time.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe Seoul airport is big and new and nice.  It was there that I finally saw the sun go down -- 20 hours after it had illuminated the fog in Baton Rouge.  What a long period of daylight.  of course, since we had crossed the international date line, it was tomorrow's sunset.  It gets kind of confusing if you let yourself think about it.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe flight to Bangkok wasn't nearly as long.  It was 5 1\/2 hours.  Again I was asleep pretty good right after takeoff, but the stewardess woke me up to serve a plate of hot, soggy, tasteless vegetables.  Since I had been served two similar plates on the first flight, and then gotten some pretty good food in Seoul, I wasn't too keen on that.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe guy next to me was a friendly ethnic Thai, who lived in Minnesota.  American living had made him at least 40 pounds heavier than any Thai over here.  He was enthusiastic about the news broadcast on the plane's video, and he encouraged me to don headphones, listen, and discuss the news with him.  Nice as he was, the long trip had not been too good to the man's body oder.  I thought he had farted when he first sat down, but I noticed the smell whenever he shifted around a lot.  Fortunately, that didn't happen too often.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nFinally in Thailand, I was ready to breeze through customs and get to my parents'.  But, this new golf bag that Dad had me bring got me stopped and routed through the slow line of bureaucrats.  Since it was new, they needed an import duty to be paid on it.  They asked me how much it had cost in dollars, and then went through the following conversion on a basic calculator:<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n50  (I had told them it cost $50.  I really have no idea what Dad paid, but I imagine it was more than that.)<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n+ 10 % -->  calculator shows 55.  <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n* 30 (converting to bhat)<br \/>\r\n%  (calculator shows him 30 percent of 55 instead of 30 * 55).<br \/>\r\n%  (just to randomize the number some more)<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nAt this point, he realizes that the number on the calculator makes no sense, so he started over.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n50 * 1.1<br \/>\r\n* 39  (converting to bhat at a new exchange rate, I noticed)<br \/>\r\n%  (Oh damn!  Someone needs to show this guy the = button)<br \/>\r\n%  (Nice and random looking again).<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nHe looked at the calculator screen for a minute, and then announced that the duty on the golf bag was 500 bhat.  I noticed that was a nice round number, given that his calculator was out to many decimal places of precision.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI had to go out into the crowd and find Mom and Dad to get 500 bhat to get my luggage through customs.  I expected the golf bag to be up this morning making us waffles for all the trouble that it had been (this being just the finale of golf bag trouble), but alas, it was not.\r\n"

We packed in a lot of activity, and I can honestly say that we could not have experienced more cultural oddities than we did in such a short time.  Thai smut is just one piece of the big puzzle.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nHeather, Sarah, Dad, and I took the sky train from dinner to Patpong.  Patpong is the district for all of the adult activities.  The street was like a Turkish bazaar  -- zillions of booths selling anything imaginable.  The sides are lined with one nudie bar after another.  People stand outside to try to get you in; the funniest thing was that they have menus of things to expect inside.

When they finally get to the front of the line, they do a little trick with their vaginas.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nWe saw them put rings around the necks of bottles and blow out candles.  One woman had a take on the magic tricks with the scarves:  she pulled out yards and yards or ribbon.  She was kind of funny, because it took a long time to get all of that ribbon out of her nether regions, and she was clearly bored with the wait.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe best trick was the dart throwing.  The woman uses a chair to prop herself upside down.  Then, darts shoot out from between her legs, popping balloons hung up high but near the edge of the stage.  If a dart would miss, it would go sailing into the spectators.  You really have to keep your head up in that place.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe funniest part was how the women on stage made no effort to engage the crowd or seem erotic.  No one even smiled.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThat might have been so that they didn't distract you too much from hookers who would approach you every few seconds.  And I was there with my wife and sister.  They were a real pain in the ass, asking for money constantly.  Women without good English skills carried buckets with writing on them:  \"Give money for Pussy Show!!!!!!\"<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI don't think we ended up staying much longer than half an hour.  That really was enough.  Although I doubt I will go back, it is an activity that every visitor to Bangkok should plan to experience.  There's nothing like it back here, I can assure you.\r\n"

There's nothing wrong with that, except that it leads to long stretches of incompetent temps working the phones.  I remember one woman who was around for months, who always pronounced the company name as \"APE-ro\" instead of \"AP-ro.\"<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI noticed the current front desk woman last week.  She seems friendly enough.  She's about the age and demeanor where you might expect her to be doting on new grandchildren.  I did notice that she stared at me bug-eyed one day as I crossed the lobby, but I figured she was just really curious, and I really haven't given her much thought one way or the other.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nYesterday, two friends of mine came back from lunch, and she was staring off into space, laughing to herself.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n\"What's so funny,\" one of them asked.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n\"Well, there's just some crazy people in the world,\" she relied.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThey should have let the entire conversation end there.  But the other one pressed.  \"What do you mean by that?\"<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nWhich led to the following story.  I'm quoting as accurately as possible, to the best of my knowledge.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<blockquote>Well, when I was six months old -- and I remember this like it was yesterday -- my mother put me down in a bassinet.  And this man came by.  He was a big man.  A black guy.  And when I looked over, he was masturbating in front of my sister.<\/blockquote><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nAt this point, the woman paused, which should have given them a chance to get out of there, but was instead wasted on stunned silence.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<blockquote>And then, when I was in first grade, someone wrote a story about all of this happening.  I got in trouble for writing it, but it wasn't me.  Someone else wrote it.  It wasn't me.<\/blockquote><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI think she might have been getting belligerent at this point, so they moved on out in the lobby to let her laugh at her memories.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI readily admit that this sounds like something that I would make up, but this one really did happen.  I guess I know where to go if I'm ever short of material to write about.<br \/>\r\n\r\n"

White\/blue hazy skies are a given.  This is their hottest time of the year, and their cool season was miserably hot when we went there 2 years ago.  <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nOn the other hand, that trip will almost certainly provide some good stories to share on this site.

This is the third article that mentions going to a parade, and I've only posted a dozen or so.  I guess that if you see that I'm planning a road trip to parades in other states, you'd better encourage me to seek some help.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nAs you've guessed by now, the Baton Rouge St. Patrick's Day parade was this weekend.  This is certainly the best one that we have in town.  It always takes place at 10:00 on a Saturday, and the weather always cooperates.  This year was no exception:  enough clouds to keep it from getting too hot, but plenty nice enough to be outside.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe parade itself was good.  We carried beads and cups home, but still left a sea of them in the grass where we were watching.  I got a number of good throws that with explicit instructions that they were just for the dog.  Cute dogs and kids get all of the good stuff, it seems.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nWhen it was over, we walked back home from the parade route.  The biggest surprise of the day was finding Eddie and Carmel already at our house.  It wasn't surprising that they were already at the house -- it was surprising to find them naked in our bed!  I guess they thought the parade would last a little longer than it did.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nAfter that, we sat around, drank beer, and boiled crawfish.  Actually, I just drank, ran my mouth, and played with the kids.  Eddie did all of the work with the crawfish.  I did throw some sausage on the grill, but then forgot about them until someone else finally took them off.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI sacked out around 8:00 that night.  The funny thing is that I woke up nice and refreshed at 10:30.  I thought I had slept all night, and it took me a little while to figure out that the 10:30 number on the clock meant that I had only slept a little while.  <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI will add some pictures to the site, but am too tired to do it tonight.  They'll be up in the next couple of days.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nAnd oh yeah, that part about Eddie and Carmel didn't really happen, but Ed did think about it, so props to him for that.<br \/>\r\n\r\n"

I spent one afternoon in the hotel spa, and got a massage and a facial.  We all know what happens in a massage, but maybe not what goes on with a facial.  Besides, there's someone out there who is curious about what goes on in a men's facial, and who will find this site through Goggle years from now.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nYou start out by getting naked and under a sheet.  As far as I can tell, there's really no need to be naked, but that's what you do.  Go figure.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThen, the woman comes in to actually do the work.  The steps go something like this.  I can't really explain why any of these things are done like they are.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n1.  Blast the face with hot steam.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n2.  Apply layer after layer of smelly crap to the face.  Some layers make it feel hot, some make it feel cold.  Some made it tingly.  One felt sandy, but most were smooth.  All of these are smeared all over the face, and then wiped off.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n3.  Dig dried up dirt and sweat out of nose pores with a really small, sharp spoon-like thing.  This part hurts.  It really sucks.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n4.  Smear some more smelly cream around.  This one stays on and thickens.  Something kind of heavy goes over my eyelids.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n5.  While that stuff thickens, the lady fills baggies with warm wax, and wraps them around my hands and feet.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nHow ridiculous did I look at this point?  I'm lying naked with my arms, legs, and upper body sticking out of a sheet.  My face is completely covered with God-knows-what.  I wish I knew what color it was, but there's no telling.  My arms and legs end with wax-filled balloons rather than with normal human appendages.  I would love to see a picture of that.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nIt ends by removing all of that silly stuff, another blast of steam, and then the lady disappears.<br \/>\r\n\r\n"

		"post_content" : "I made a personal goal this week to post five entries in five days.  That's getting to be a tough task.  It's not that I don't have plenty to rant about -- in fact, the more of these that I write, the more I think of.  (You can't tell that there's any self-editing here, but you should read some of the garbage that <i>doesn't <\/i>make it.)<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nNo, it's actually just lack of time today and tomorrow that keep me from lengthy and interesting thoughts to share.  Instead, I have a quick observation and comment that all sprung from an advertisement that I saw when I was getting dressed this morning.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI saw a commercial for the local Lincoln\/Mercury car dealership.  This particular commercial has the dealership full of young families:  30-somthing parents, with cute active kids.  The problem with this whole thing is that there's no way in hell that <i>any <\/i>of these people are going to buy a Lincoln or a Mercury.  I really thought that you had to be collecting social security before they would even let you into the dealership.  At the very least, they must have an AARP discount.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThis local advertisement is no more rediculous than Tiger Woods pitching Oldsmobiles.  I can't really picture Tiger in his home town, showing up to pick up his hot young girlfriend in a giant Oldsmobile sedan.  I can't picture him stumbling out of the nightclub at four in the morning, and telling the valet, \"it's the white Cutlass Supreme.\"<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nActually, I don't think they even make a Cutlass Supreme any more, or at least they couldn't possibly be selling them.  To be honest, I couldn't name a single Oldsmobile model that I would be confident is still made.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI wonder if in the geezer circles it would be uncool to drive an Accura or a BMW if you were looking for a comfortable car.  Would your geezer friends give you grief, as in (read in your best senior citizen voice), \"What do you think you are?  Some kind of college boy in that thing?\"  <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe tradeoff for driving big, ugly, giant, American sedans is that you wake willingly at the crack of dawn, and then go some place to hook up with your buddies and bullshit until about 10:00 in the morning.  We're all too busy going to work to notice these people, but check it out the next time you have a day off.  There will be small groups of retired men hanging out for no apparent reason in lots of the places that you go.  You do have to check old-fashioned breakfast places though.  There's no way they are going to pay $27.50 for a coffee at Starbucks when they can still get a bitter fifty-cent cup somewhere else.\r\n"

Actually, the ratings show that there are more fans, but at least some of us reality fans aren't willing to admit it.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI have to admit that I've watched my fair share of Reality TV.  Like other programming, some of it is fantastic, and some of it is wretched.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nOne of my favorite aspects about reality TV is how quickly a show can go from the talk of the office to a total tank.  Everyone used to talk about the people who had to eat sheep guts on Fear Factor, but now nobody watches that show any more.  They raised the \"eating gross stuff\" bar as high as it would go.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI think American Idol is getting to that point.  Even when the people sing good, they choose really crappy light-rock numbers to perform.  They had a show a couple of nights ago to bring back the bad singers who got cut.  Even that one wasn't as much fun as I thought it would be.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nBy the way, during the early rounds, they showed about a 15-second clip of some psychopath singing in a Winnie the Pooh costume.  We never did get to see the judges reaction or hear what the guy was thinkig.  Maybe they're saving that clip for later.  I'm definitely intrigued.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nDiscovery Channel set up the best night in television on Mondays with Monster House and American Chopper.  They have a problem with a limited number of episodes, but heck, some of these are worth watching again.  <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nFox brought Mondays one level higher with My Big Fat Obnoxious Fiance.  The jist of this one is that an actor gets to play obnoxious guy for the friends and family of his \"finace.\"  They aren't really planning to get engaged, but their challenge is to get all of those people to believe it.  The obnoxious guy was fantastic.  My favorite part was when he told a future in law that he had just taken a \"monster shit.\"  (That inspires me to drop that same information on my in-laws.  I'll let you all know the reaction if I really work up the nerve to do it.)<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nGenerally, the dating shows are not very good.

We saw Charles Barkley playing the high-limit tables at Mandalay bay.  I think it is a noble goal for me to try to get celebrities to give me quotes to post directly to this site.

The weather is crappy anyway, so we try to catch as many of the Oscar contenders as possible.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nIn past two years, there has always been a geezer movie -- those movies that feature older characters, and whose audience has move elderly people than normal.  You would think that the geezers would have better movie manners than most crowds, but just the opposite is true.  (It's bad enough that these tend to be on the boring side of the movie excitement scale.)  <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe old folks are masters of the really loud whisper.  They repeat lines that they find clever -- which are almost every line.  They predict what is about to happen -- especially if it is already obvious.  And they absolutely can not resist the temptation to explain every joke to their companions.  Sometimes they compete to see who can be the first to explain the joke.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThis year's awards were dominated by the last of the Lord of the Rings movies, which I haven't seen yet.  I saw the first one, and maybe I'm missing something, but despite all the graphical effects, it was a little boring.  Maybe I should see it again, since everyone else seems to have loved it.  I just don't know.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThere seemed to be a theme running through a lot of the movies that I have seen lately.  See if you can pick it up from these synopses:<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n*  Monster:  messed up kid gets involved with a serial-killing hooker.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n*  Mystic River:  messed up kid grows up and may or may not have murdered his friend's daughter.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n*  Pieces of April:  formerly messed up kid tries to cook dinner for her family.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n*  Thirteen:  kid goes from normal to really, really messed up.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n*  City of Gods:  messed up kids participate in gang war.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n*  Finding Nemo:  rebellious kid fish disobeys parent and gets put in a tank.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n*  Finding the Friedmans:  whacked data and son may or may not have abused other children.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe four movies that I recommend are:<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n*  Lost in translation.  The best scenes really are the ones where the Japanese people are rattling off minutes of instructions to Bill Murray, and his translator gives him a one-sentence, vague instruction in English.  I hope the DVD will give you a feature where you can really find out what the Japanese guys are saying.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n*  Master and Commander.  Most sailors like these books, but I find them a bit boring.  Not the movie, though.  It was thoroughly enjoyable.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n*  Pieces of April.  The ending made me happy.  Sometimes, that's all it takes.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n*  City of God.  My favorite one of the year.  It was exciting, horrifying, and entertaining all at once.  The violence and depravity seemed very realistic.  <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nOf course, with my middle-American, suburban upbringing, how the hell would I know if Brazilian gang war is portrayed realistically or not?<br \/>\r\n\r\n"

		"post_content" : "Yesterday was the final day of the Mardi Gras season, and as some of my regular readers might guess, I like to catch a parade or two during the month.  I admit right now that I had a crappier parade-going schedule this year than most.  We had pretty consistent cold rain in February, except for the final weekend, when we were in Las Vegas.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nOne more excuse before I actually mention any parades:  the nature of these events forces you to choose to cover it in a journalistic fashion, or as a drinking, bead-catching participant.  Wonder which path I chose?<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe first parade that I caught this year was entirely by accident.  Two Fridays ago, I went downtown for a beer after work.  We had a good, steady, and cold rain.  Baton Rouge's finest had street after street blocked off, for absolutely no one.  I couldn't get to any of the empty parking lots that would have meant a short walk through the rain.  <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe actual parade looked okay.  They seemed to have a good number of bands, and plenty of floats.  But there couldn't have possibly been one family member for all of the parade participants.  I waited outside through two floats, and of course, there was plenty to catch.  The most interesting bead was a strand of blue, with a plastic representation of a bottle of Windex dangling from it.  Windex?  Can you imagine calling the Chinese company that makes beads and trying to explain your order for several thousand Windex beads?<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nBaton Rouge also has a dog parade that is usually lots of fun.  You would enjoy reading about it -- if I had actually gone.  Oh well.  Gives you something to look forward to next year.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI went to two New Orleans parades this year, which rolled back to back.  <br \/>\r\nThe first was Saturn, which wasn't really that good.  I think they got delayed somewhere along the parade route, and there were a few floats that were out of beads by the time they got downtown.  There were also flambeaus, who were out of fuel, which made them just regular guys carrying big metal contraptions for no apparent reason.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe final parade was Muses.  Heather has been a member of this krewe for the few years that it has been in existence.  They usually throw a pretty good parade.  As usual, I caught tons of good stuff, but it is far more satisfying catching from a stranger than from a ringer on one of the floats.  Their floats were big and good (One was a giant shoe, covered in glowing fiber-optic strands.  There seems to be some question about whether the woman on top of the shoe was a real woman or a drag queen.  Email me if you know.)<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThey also had a band of Elvises on really small scooters.  I wonder how I get into scooter riding with a bunch of Elvises.  That looks like a much better hobby than typing stupid junk for the internet.  <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nDuring the course of the parade, I learned that in some New Orleans homes, it is considered stylish to hang your good beads from the nice chandelier that one has hanging somewhere in the house.  I couldn't wait to get home and get my Windex bead up above the dining room table.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThere was also a pack of grown-ups dressed and acting like a high school band, but I'm not sure what that was all about.  I think that ever since American Pie came out, band nerds are proud to flaunt their band-nerdiness.  No movie ever did more for a specific pack of nerds.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nAt the after-party, all the parade participants were just cold and tired.  Except for the Elvises and their appropriately costumed dates, it cleared out pretty quickly.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n\r\n"

I can't remember how it worked its way into the conversation, but whenever I think of it, I can't help but laugh.  It goes without saying that this is strictly hypothetical:<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nConsider how you would approach you wife and request a spanking -- yes a spanking, and do it with a striaght face.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI can tell you right now that there's no way in the world that I could do it without laughing.  I mean, why on earth would you want a spanking from your wife?  There's just nothing sexy or cool about being smacked on the ass.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nBut pretending that I could pull it off, it would go something like this:<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nMe:  Um, sweetie.... I was thinking... I think it might be really swell if you would...um...if you would...well, if you would drop my drawers and give me a spanking.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nHeather:  You <i>what<\/i>?<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nMe:  Seriously.  It would be cool.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nHeather:  No, I wasn't listening.  What did you say?<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI stammer out the request again.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nHeather:  You must be out of your mind.  Where did you come up with such a thing?<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nNow consider the odd situation that would occur after you have been on the receiving end of a spanking.  You and the wife are disagreeing on some aspect of family life.  Maybe it's where to send the kids to school; maybe it's whether to vacation in Hawaii or in Vancouver.  If you just got a spanking the night before, then you instantly lose that arguement.  No questions asked.  All the wife has to say is, \"Shut up.  You actually let me <i>spank <\/i>you last night.\"  How could you argue?<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nSo let's close with a challenge:  in the next day, approach your wife, husband, boyfriend, girlfriend (or boss, stranger, friend.  Whoever) as seriously as you can, and ask for a spanking.  Let us know how it goes.  If I get any emails on this, I'll post a follow-up.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n\r\n"

I think it would make some interesting photos for the skinny on benny web page.<\/p><\/blockquote><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nFollowed by an almost immediate response from Heather:<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<blockquote align=\"yes\"><p align=\"left\">YES!<\/p><\/blockquote><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nFollowed, about 10 minutes later by Stacie:<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<blockquote><p align=\"left\">I think that they prefer to be called \"little people,\" Miss Williams.<\/p><\/blockquote><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nSo, with that amount of planning, we had plans to see midgets wrestle.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nDuring the day on Friday, Shelly called to ask me if there was a difference between a midget and a hobbit.  What can you really reply?  I went with something like, \"Um, <i>yeah<\/i>, a midget is real.  A hobbit is make-believe.\"<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nShe went on to ask about whether a dwarf was real, and if so, what the difference was.  After I explained the difference (with a huge deficit of actual knowledge, but convincingly, nevertheless), Shelly seemed satisfied to end my unplanned excursion to trivia-world.  But she did manage to tell me something along the lines of my having no life, as she was leaving work around 3:00 to buy midget wrestling tickets.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe actual wrestling was pretty much what I expected.  The people had a normal sized wrestling ring set up in the middle of the bar.  Miller High Life was on special, but they were out of that by 11:00.  Shortly after 11:00 a lone midget entered the ring, and worked some tired material full of f-bombs on the crowd.  He would get the DJ to stop and start music, and when the DJ would be too slow, ask the people, \"Who wants to see a midget fuck up a DJ?\"  That was kind of funny, but by far his best line.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 border=0 align=right><tr><td width=5 rowspan=2><spacer type=block width=5 height=1><\/spacer><\/td><td width=275><img src=\"\/img\/MidgetDown.JPG\" height=200 width=275 aborder=0 vspace=4\/><\/td><\/tr><tr><td width=275><font face=\"verdana, arial, geneva\" size=1 color=#666666><b>A midget wrestler waits for another midget to climb the ropes, then pretend to fall on them.<\/b><\/font><\/td><\/tr><\/table><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nWhen we finally got midgets in the ring to wrestle, it was unbelievably goofy and fake.  I suppose the bogus fighting was no less fake than professional wrestling on TV, but they had no fancy music, smoke, lighting, or costumes to distract you from the fake fighting.  It was still kind of funny, just because the people fighting were \"little people,\" as Stacie put it.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI'm having trouble inserting this tidbit in a graceful fashion, so I'll just blurt it out in its own paragraph:  one of those midgets had the biggest nipples that I've ever seen in a man.  Not big-a-round big.  Sticking out like a digit big.  They had to stick off his chest a good quarter-inch.  Wow.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe fights lasted a good while.  Believe it or not, there were several close calls, when the count got to two, but time after time, the midget on bottom dug deep inside himself for a little extra, and threw the upper midget off.  After two fights of this, the smoke burned eyes and throats, we had seen midgets bleed, and it was one o'clock in the morning, so that ended the night of midget wrestling.\r\n"

		"post_content" : "The biggest story of my football lifetime is LSU's national championship this season.  I used to say that if LSU wins the national championship in the Sugar Bowl, that I would give up watching football, since there would be nothing left to hope for.  I'm still considering that as the plan for Fall, but for now, let's reflect on this past season.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThree interesting observations:<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<li>  <b>Being champions is fun.<\/b>  It's not just fun in the immediate celebration, water cooler excitement, rah-rah way that you thing about.  Being national champions just makes everything seem a little better.  I've had several real conversations at work along these lines:<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nMe:  \"What's the matter?\"<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nCo-worker mentions whatever dumb-shit problem is bothering him.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nMe:  \"Well, sure, but hey, we're national champions.\"<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nCo-worker (brightening):  \"Hey, so we are!\"<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<\/li><li>  <b>Being champions is lucrative.<\/b>  The amount of crap that you get the opportunity to buy when your team wins the national championship is unreal.  Every store has its own collection of DVDs, videos, books, magazines, clothes, auto accessories, and anything else you can imagine to commemorate the season.  <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThis morning, I was behind one of those short busses that the special students had to take to school when we were young.  This particular one had been converted to some sort of contractor's vehicle.  It was well-dented and full of rust.  But, the one new -- and very out of place -- accessory was the bumper sticker telling the world of LSU's national championship.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nWe even caught people buying large TV sets at Best Buy, just for the game.  I'm not sure if that's admirable or just kind of sad.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<\/li><li>  The one thing that I learned through all of this is that <b>Baton Rouge throws a crappy parade.<\/b>  The \"Parade of Champions\" was scheduled to celebrate LSU's national championship and Southern University's Black College National Championship.  They didn't throw this together a couple of days after the Sugar Bowl.  No indeed, they needed a couple of weeks to get this planned.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe jist of the parade was this:  some convertibles drive by with officials from each school.  Then, the Southern Band marched by.  This was followed by a fleet of fire trucks with players sitting around on them.  They were segregated by position, so one truck with defensive linemen might pass, followed by a truck with offensive linemen, and so on.  The kicker and punter got stuck on the last truck with towel boys and trainers.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThen, the whole band followed by fire truck thing was repeated for LSU players.  The kickers seemed no less pathetic.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI really had to hope that either Baton Rouge had borrowed fire trucks from other cities, or that no oneï¿½s house would alight while the parade was happening.  There had to be close to 20 big engines in the parade, and Iï¿½ve got to imagine that this represents a significant portion of our cityï¿½s fire fighting capacity.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nBut the real embarrassment is that there was one part of the parade that was supposed to shower the teams in ticker tape.  That's what you do when you win the championship, right?  Have a ticker tape parade?  I'm almost positive I've heard of that.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 border=0 align=right><tr><td width=5 rowspan=2><spacer type=block width=5 height=1><\/spacer><\/td><td width=275><img src=\"\/img\/PoorTownsTickerTape.jpg\" height=200 width=275 aborder=0 vspace=4\/><\/td><\/tr><tr><td width=275><font face=\"verdana, arial, geneva\" size=1 color=#666666><b>Baton Rouge Celebrates the Southern Jaguars with Toilet Paper<\/b><\/font><\/td><\/tr><\/table><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI did kind of wonder where ticker tape would come from.  Certainly, there aren't any stock tickers any more.  Would it really be cash register tape?  That would make sense.  Maybe we could spot the pink dye on the edge that indicates the end of the roll.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nNo, cash register tape would be too classy for a Baton Rouge parade.  Here, they threw -- get ready -- they threw toilet paper.  Toilet paper.  Honest to God.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<b>And so that takes us to last night's Super Bowl.<\/b>  As you know, it was a good game, but it was hard to care about the outcome.  Mom and Sarah were pulling for Carolina, since they are from Charlotte, but New England had more LSU players, and Kevin Faulk even scored a critical two-point conversion toward the end of the game.  So either way I'm happy really.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI am a little disappointed that I missed some of the on-air nudity around the half time show.  Sarah called while I was in the kitchen to ask if that was really Janet Jackson's nipple that had been exposed.  <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nSay what?  <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nSure enough, it was, and I missed it.  I'm sure I could find it on the internet, but Janet isn't worth a sleazy internet search.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI also just heard that there was a fat guy who streaked after the musicians played at halftime, and catching him is what took an extra minute to get the second half underway.  Man, how drunk would you have to be?  And how much money would your buddies have to pony up for a stunt like that?  That guy is a real hero.  (Oddly, in my mind, this guy probably is worth a sleazy internet search.)<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<b>One last Super Bowl story<\/b>, and I'll wrap this one up:  I joined a Super Bowl pool being run by a kid's baseball team.  The baseball team took the bets, kept a sizable vigorish (they would have been run out of any respectable gambling community), and then distributed winnings.  I didn't mind the high takeout, since it was kids coming up with a creative fun way to support their baseball.  <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThis did get me thinking about it though:  why not just continue the fundraising with other organized-crime activities.  I'm sure some of the downtown businesses would pay the team \"protection\" money to keep their windows from getting smashed.  For those that won't pay, well, they already have bats.  It's a good fit.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n\r\n<\/li>"
