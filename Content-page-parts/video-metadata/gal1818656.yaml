            There are so many things that make me laugh when I watch this.  I have to start with the too-small pajamas with the tag sticking out of the back.  Follow that with the non-stop bossiness, and how Kolya doesn't really care.  And then V gets frustrated with him.

            "Baby K" is what Vanya keeps calling him.

            If my younger self could have witnessed this, he would punch himself in the mouth.

            We were at lunch with Pooh, Tigger, et al, and they decided to have a march around the room to celebrate "Friendship Day."  V was really having fun, but he's close to the back of a man who's big enough to have stayed in his seat, so you only get a quick look at his excitement.

        caption: |
            What made Disney worth being packed into a hellish sea of humanity was Vanya.  This is from right before lunch.  We had watched a bit of a stage show in front of the castle, and I started to video as we moved away.  You can see the excitement in his step, even though we had been in the park for several hours.  This kid had a really fun day, and that made it fun for us all.

        caption: |
            When we got to our room at the Animal Planet Lodge, there was a giraffe outside the room.  He wasn't really as much of a hit as I would have expected him to be.  You can tell that I'm happier to see him than either of my kids.

        caption: |
            I started this video because I was enjoying the band, and we got the added bonus that we get to catch what happens when I get an ice water spilled in my lap while filming.  Language is surprisingly safe for family viewing.

            I dare you to find another video on the entire internet that shares this title and is not something racist.

            This is Kolya, enjoying a nice outdoor evening, after eating pudding for desert.

            On the last night of our Easter Voyage, we had dropped anchor, and dyed Easter eggs.  After that, there was nothing to do but play.  Vanya requested pop music, and both kids danced away.

            Often, when one of us is working on the computer, Kolya climbs up and turns up the music.  I'm sure he figured this out by accident, but I'm equally sure that he does it on purpose now.

            Here, he enjoys Metallica's Enter Sandman.

            Kolya hasn't often initiated fun, playfulness with Vanya.  Here, he chooses homework time to do just that.

        caption: |
            In which Vanya gets frustrated, because he doesn't understand that babies aren't born knowing how to play cards.  To make it worse, this is a game to teach reading, and I don't think poor Kolya had a chance to read the words on the cards just yet.
