            There was an LSU Tailgate party the weekend before Halloween, and we let Vanya wear his Batman costume to the game.  He and I crossed the street to play in a field for a little while in the afternoon.

            I was cleaning up the kitchen on July 18, 2009, when this site came through.  It's a pretty funny one.

            By the way, this is my first HD video that I've uploaded.  The quality improvement is obvious.

            May 19 was the anniversary of the day that we picked up Vanya at the orphanage.  We got him a tricycle as a present that day.  This is one of his first days learning to ride.  It's just the smallest bit too big for him here.
