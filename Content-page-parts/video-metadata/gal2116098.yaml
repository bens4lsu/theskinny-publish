        name: Shepherd #2
        caption: |
            Here's a clip from Vanya's school Christmas play.  He was shepherd number 2, and was one of the only kids with two lines.  You sorta miss the first one, because Kolya was so eager to get to his brother that all you hear is him yelling and whining.  There are a couple of short segments where I have to set the camera aside and try to calm down the little one.

        name: Vanya Wins an Impossibly Hard Game
        caption: |
            At the Boo at the Zoo event, one of the only Games Vanya chose to play was this one, where you try to catapult frogs into little holes by hitting a hammer on a launcher.  I watched a lot of kids play while he stood in line, and it looked impossibly hard to me.

            Somehow, he hit the target on his last slap at it.  There's no explosion of joy or anything, since he's conditioned to the fact that whatever he wants falls into his lap, no matter what.

        caption: We went to soccer practice on 10/14/12, and it had apparently been canceled.  V and I played together some, and he was killing it with sharp kicks and crisp passes.  Until I started recording, anyway.

            Vanya's grandmother got him a new plaything, to make it so that the only thing he wants to do with his life is come up to the farm and drive around.  I suspect that it's working.

            This video is his first trial/training run in the new ride.  Part of the fun is watching all of the bewildered farm dogs.

            Baby K enjoys playing with the umbrella.  This is during one of V's soccer games.  He's playing wiht one of the other kids on the team who (obviously) isn't in the game at the time this is taken.

        name: Swing!
        caption: |
            On this day, Kolya was enjoying his swing, as usual, and I picked up the camera and made a little bit of video.  He got down, played for a while, and then came back to swing some more.  On that run, he quickly fell asleep.

        name: Testing the Really Big Slide at New Orleans City Park
        caption: |
            More than once, Vanya has made his way to the top of this slide, only to chicken out and climb back down.  I think this is the first time he completed the slide.  In fairness, this is the only time we've been to it during daylight hours.  Kolya follows, somewhat hilariously.

            My orders were to video this in a way so that the singer couldn't look at me.  He really doesn't sing loud enough for us to hear, but I happen to know that he's able to sing pretty well.

            The most important thing to notice here is the Run DMC playing through the bluetooth speaker that the baby is flinging around so carelessly.  For some reason, Heather's phone was a HUGE Run DMC fan this Summer.  Aside from that, it's a simple clip of life at anchor.

        name: Kolya cut and paste crafts
        caption: |
            One evening, while H & V were off at one of his activities, K wanted to do "guh-loo."  So I found an old magazine, a piece of paper, and a jar of glue, and we went outside to try to do what craft-y parents do all of the time.

            Fast forward to 4:05 to see why I'm not a craft kind of parent.  K pretty much dodges cutting his finger clean off, while I mess with the camera.  I didn't even know how  much he did all of this until I looked at the video a couple of weeks later.

            The highlight of this one is the piece right in the middle where the kids sign "Silent Night."  Rudolph toward the end is pretty fun too.

        caption: |
            In 2013, we thought the Santa hired to visit the kids at Vanya's school was pretty bad.  Then, we encountered this guy at Kolya's school the next day.  We couldn't help but laugh at the guy.

            This video is of his entrance.  You can only see the back of K's head -- he's sitting in a teacher's lap right in front of us.  He wasn't fooled either.
