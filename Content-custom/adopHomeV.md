<h1>Vanya</h1>
We adopted Vanya from a baby home in Yaroslavl, Russia, in Spring/Summer 2007.

This story has more nitty-gritty details about the process. Highlights of the process included celebrating St. Patrck's day with a Russian-speaking wierd band, and spending three of four weeks in Russia without luggage and mostly without hot water.
