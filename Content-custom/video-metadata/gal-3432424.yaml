        caption: When I got my first drone, it had this footage loaded on it, which the manufacturers apparently forgot to delete.

        caption: We run a test flight, then use the "return home" button, only to get stuck in a tree.  The video continues shooting while you see attempts to dislodge the drone from the branches.

        name: Louisiana Marathon Drone Mishap
        caption: As you may know, the Louisiana Marathon passes right in front of our house.  I had the idea this year that it would be fun to fly the drone up above the runners as they passed.  Instead, I damn near knocked an exhausted runner in the head.  My co-spectators refused to allow me another test flight.

            For Spring Break in 2023, we camped out in Ozard National forest.  We had a spot on the shore of a pretty lake whose name I don't know, and there were no other people anywhere that we could see.  Here's a lake fly over.

            In October, 2022, we started cleaning out the garage.  We thought it would take a weekend.  maybe two.  We finally got it all done and organized in March.  Here's a look at all of the shit that we packed into a one-car garage.

            A drone seems like a perfect solution for looking for a problem at the top of the sailboat mast.  Let's see how that goes.
