            Some of the last bits of the Pre-K4 Thanksgiving presentation that the kids did for us before the "Feast at their school.  A lot of what I shot got file-corrupted and lost, and I think this is toward the end of their work.  You can see Vanya toward the back, acting silly, and at one point, you can definitely hear him over the other kids.

        name: Tailgate Rainstorm
        caption: |
            There was a short but heavy rain storm during a tailgate Saturday.  After it ends, the kids play in the river of water running down the street toward the gutter.  Nervous nelly mothers can relax.  No one gets sucked down the drain.

        name: Run Away
        caption: I was looking for a cute video of Vanya playing on the beach, and for some reason, he decided to sprint away at full-speed.  You'll see me try to keep up for a minute, and then just give up altogether.

            Jake and Vanya irritate each other on a car ride.  Or perhaps they're just irritating the adults.  Watch and come up with your own judgment.

            Sorry about the quality of this one.  It was way too dark in the car to get a good pic with my camera.  I used software to     brighten it enough to see, but the remaining picture is noisy, and there are those black bars for some reason or other.

        name: Splinter Removal
        caption: Vanya had a pretty good run of picking up splinters from the deck during vacation at a rental house in Tennessee.  We're on Watts Bar Lake.  Background musics is "Sweet Melissa" by the Allman Brothers, which seems like fitting music for shirtless barefoot people in rural Tennessee.

            First T-Ball Game:  Fielding
        caption: During the first T-ball game, Vanya wasn't really comfortable chasing and fielding the ball yet.  At least he had the grabbing of his junk down.

            I made fun of Crystal for having a shitload of those plastic spatula-spoon things, and commented that our kid would love to have them.  Later, a couple of them showed up in the mail for him.

            This video is right after he unpacked his gift on 4/7/10.

            By the way, he doesn't usually wear the redneck sleeveless t's, and I think this is the only video I have where he is so dressed.

            SBU also won their conference tournament and drew a  seed in the NCAAs this year.

        caption: |
            Playtime in the airport on our way to return home on Thanksgiving weekend.  "Close your eyes and count to four" is a close cousin of hide and seek, except that you only get to count to four, and if you're it, your're it forever.  Also, the person hiding is usually the one to shout, "ready or not, here I come!"
