        caption: When I got my first drone, it had this footage loaded on it, which the manufacturers apparently forgot to delete.

        name: Drone Test - Stuck in Tree
        caption: We run a test flight, then use the "return home" button, only to get stuck in a tree.  The video continues shooting while you see attempts to dislodge the drone from the branches.

        name: Louisiana Marathon Drone Mishap
        caption: As you may know, the Louisiana Marathon passes right in front of our house.  I had the idea this year that it would be fun to fly the drone up above the runners as they passed.  Instead, I damn near knocked an exhausted runner in the head.  My co-spectators refused to allow me another test flight.
