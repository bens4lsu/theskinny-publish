           Perhaps Kolya will someday see this clip as an invasion of privacy, but there's no doubt that in the moment, he was an enthusiastic performer.

        name: Look at Sandra Dee
        caption: |
            Summer of 2014 will almost certainly be remembered as the Summer that Kolya started singing selections from Grease.  His favorite, by a long margin, is Sandra Dee.  There were times where he sang it more enthusasitcally on video, but this is the best I was able to capture.  Sandy isn't immune to stage fright, and she isn't even aware of the internet just yet.

            V got invited to participate in a drama camp at my sister's church.  We knew V would love it, and we didn't think about the fact that it would probably be a play with some super-protestant doctrine for the kids to absorb.

            It's not the easiest video to watch, but if you make it full-screen, you can see V having a really good time.  My nephew Caleb is the kid that gets converted to "God's Team" in the course of the show.

            Oh, the song where the kids sign is very nice.

            In case you quit early (as you should), they never do tell you who wins the race and the season championship.
