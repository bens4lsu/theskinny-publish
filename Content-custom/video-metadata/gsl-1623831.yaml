            This is the beginning of cookie making for Heather and Vanya.  I walked into the room as they were getting to the part of the recipe where eggs needed to be added.  If you think of this as an I Love Lucy episode, the results will be no surprise.

            "You're about to sound like a mean old shrew in front of all America."

            "You better not put this anywhere."

        caption: I can't believe anyone other than grandparents would stick with this series of videos this far in.  This one is more of the same with dangerous/brave/stupid (depending on your aversion to five year olds risky behavior) use of the oven.

        caption: In the series finale, the cookies come out of the oven, and then get torn to bits as Vanya tries to pry them off of the jelly roll sheet.
