            We met up with a bunch of friends at the beach in Maine in July 2023.  There was fun every moment of every day, but here's a highlight:  karyoke was wanding down at the only bar open late, and a batchelorette party had the mic for the last number.  But Crystal was into it, and ended up on center stage with the partiers.  They are looking at their videos now asking, "Who is the old lady," and they are bitter that she went center stage so that she can't even be cropped out.

            The Amazing Acrocats are always a fun December treat!  Here is a relatively new addition to the act:  several cats playing horns.

            This starts with V doing a little line dancing.  Then, there's a bit from when I went out there.  As soon as I was there, Sarah said, "oh, you don't know the rules."<br><br>
        
            "Oh, is this some sort of line dance?"<br><br>
        
            "Yeah"<br><br>
        
            So I just decided to go all-in and wing it.  <br><br>
        
            I'm glad V did some filming.  It's pretty funny.<br><br>
            Congratulations to my cousin Gabrielle and her new husband Alex.

            The lake is really full of shrimp right now, and the people aren't the only ones who have noticed.  I've never seen such an infestation of asshole birds.

            Just some random clips that weren't still photos.  
            
            I was only going to have the one shot of the Sphere, but when I saw the dancing cats, I had to add another few seconds of that.
