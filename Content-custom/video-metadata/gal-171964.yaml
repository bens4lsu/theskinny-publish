        caption: The local priests got permission to wear Saints gear on Superbowl Sunday and to fly a Saints flag over the cathedral.  We were having champagne brunch across the street from this church as they let out Sunday morning.

            Before you watch, know this:  it's a bad video.  It might even be unwatchable.  But it's hard to celebrate and film at the same time, and at the time this was shot, celebrating was the top priority.

            The scene is the Royal Sonesta bar on Bourbon Street, as time expires in Superbowl XLIV.  I'm in the back of the bar, but at some point, I make my way out into the street.

            Before you watch, know this:  it's a horrible video.  I might go as far as to say that it's unwatchable.  But it's hard to celebrate and film, so if you want to see the French Quarter at the moment that the Superbowl ended, this is what I have.

        caption: It wasn't just Bourbon Street that was packed to the gills after the game.  Here's a quick shot of Royal, which I've never seen like this.  The cross streets were just as packed.

        caption: This guy plays his rhythm, and then you're supposed to shout Who Dat!  But he either couldn't get the people doing it, or like me, they totally botched when they were supposed to yell.  It was fun all the same.
