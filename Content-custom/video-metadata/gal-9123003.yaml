            A long one tonight.  In addition to the regular update, we have a quick fish story, a tour of our switch panel (nerd alert), and 30 seconds of zen.

            Still moving along.  Bigger waves, and a little rolling.  Let's see what else is on that big panel.

        caption: |
            Just over 600 miles to go.  I talk about the state of our pantry and show you our dinghy garage.  Nice win by LSU Baseball tonight!  That's a good way to pass 3 hours of night watch.

            About 350 miles to landfall.  A look at how we watch tv in the cockpit, and a look at a couple more of the screens at the chart table.

        caption: |
            No news, but that's good news.  230 miles to go.  Talk about the daily routine.  I forgot to mention the kids much, but they just sleep all day.

       caption: |
           I think this should be my last night watch.  Thanks to everyone for all of your comments and feedback.  There's been more than one night where that was the motivation to create another video.  No plans to post tomorrow, but we'll have more online throughout the summer.

       caption: |
           Most of the time, I can rearrange work stuff to do the island field trips with the family.  Sometimes I caan't.  I didn't get to go see the volcano ruins in Montserrat, so V did a little video for me.

          Unedited clips from my library pieced together.  
          
          Partying on board, dancing at Foxy's, and jumping from Willie T's.  And about 10 seconds of a late-week snorkel.
          
          Annika did finally work up the nerve to jump, but I couldn't find the video evidence.
