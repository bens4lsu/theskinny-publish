    Home Movies (Vanya): December 2010 - November 2011
slug: home-movies-2010-2011
caption: What 8mm was to families of the 1960s, Vimeo is to our family.  These are mostly my kid, around the house or on a trip, and they're probably not interesting unless you're related.  And even then, it might be a stretch to call them interesting.  But we like having them around.

            Vanya is going to miss his Christmas recital this year, since we'll be in Russia.  Nevertheless, he was making decent progress on his pieces before we left.

            V Doesn't Clean Up
        caption: |
            Vanya was upstairs, under orders to clean up his room.  He called me up saying it was clean in an impossibly short amount of time to have had it done.

            Vanya's Soccer Game 10/29/11
        caption: |
            This is a 45-second clip of the BRSA Lions game.  The day was very cold and windy, and Vanya didn't really have any interest in getting into the mix.  

            This isn't a very good video, but it's the only one I have from soccer this fall, so I figured I would go ahead and post it.

            Vanya at Menche's
        caption: |
            How to make your ice cream gross.

            Vanya should do commercials for Menche's.  The enthusiasm that he has while covering ice cream with all sorts of incompatible crap is unparallelled.

        name: Aunt Crystal Rides
        caption: |
            In our house, if you're going slow, we call you "Aunt Crystal."  Crystal was famously described as having two speeds -- slow and stopped.

            This is from the RocketKidz triathlon on June 11, 2011.  We had been trying to learn to ride the bigger bike without training wheels, but it wasn't ready for race day.  Vanya couldn't have been much slower on the bike part of the race, but he was having fun.  I wish you could make out the smile on his face better as he passed.

            On the run, Vanya was lightning fast.  If he hadn't stopped for about two minutes at the drink table, his time would have been very impressive.
