<h1>Site Update, Part 3</h1>

<p>I'm not sure if was accidental or on purpose, but embedded Twitter feeds are now broken.  I've had it on my list to pull stuff off of Twitter, and I got far enough to pull <a href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/x/shitjohnsaid/">these tweets from an alt</a>.  But mine aren't copied down yet.  For a while, I only had 5 that would show up at all even on Twitter.  As I type this, the page <a href="https://twitter.com/bens4lsu">https://twitter.com/bens4lsu</a> doesn't bring up any content at all.</p>
 
 <p>So for now, I've moved my feed to Mastadon.</p>
