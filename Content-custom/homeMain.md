<h1>Programming Note</h1>

My "Tweets" on the left side of the full screen version of this page are from Bluesky now.  It's been about a year on Mastodon, which I liked just fine, but I can't find anyone to follow over there.  Bluesky seems fine for now.  

So to round them up, Twitter is full of nazis, Mastodon is a ghost town, Threads is full of stupid, and Bluesky is the closest I've gotten to Twitter in its heyday.  I'm still looking for some of the comedians that I liked to follow.

Scroll to the bottom for a little surprise having to do with this topic.
