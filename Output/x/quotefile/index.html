His file grew for years and years. When he left the company, I realized that the only way to save those types of things for myself was to start keeping a similar file for myself.<BR><BR>  For
            some reason, my quotes have a tendency to be nastier.  I guess that's because very few of these
            actually came from work, because I have nasty friends, and because I still think that bad
            words are funny, even though I should be old enough to be over that.<BR><BR>
