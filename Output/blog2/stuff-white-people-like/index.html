Several times, I thought, "That sounds amusing. I should check it out." But thoughts like that are quickly out of mind.</p><p>Then, I got an email from Timmy B. telling me to check it out. When I did, I had the feeling that you would have if you took down your bathroom mirror and found a hidden camera there to record your life.</p><p>It's much like I thought that the producers of The Office must be spying on APPRO Systems. The writers of this blog can't be my friends or family. They have to be spies. They know more than my friends.</p><p>It's difficult to pick examples, because almost every entry is relevant to me. But here are some that I enjoyed. Quoted paragraphs are from the pages referenced.</p><table align="center" border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0 width="90%">

	Isn't that the truth?
	
	Here's the irony:  the closer you are to a set of friends, the less you have to hear about what geniuses they produced.  If you only hear from a set of friends once a year, you can bet that you'll be sitting through a long explaination of how little Johnny just about split the atom during last year's science fair.

	"If you require a favor from a vegetarian white person, you should invite them to a dinner with your family. When your mother/grandmother offers them a dish with meat in it, they will reject it saying that they are vegetarian. When the meal is over, tell them that your mom is very embarrassed, and that in your culture rejecting food is the equivalent of spitting on someoneâ€™s grave. They will then owe you favor, this can be repeated when you need trips to the airport, someone to help you move, a small interest free loan, or a place for your friend to crash."

There are rumors of getting the cast together for a movie, which I hope happens soon.
	
	"If you are ever a white personâ€™s house, and you see an orange box in their DVD collection, you should say, 'Oh, you have Arrested Development, I love that show!' To which you will be offered a glass of wine, and perhaps an invitation to 80s night."
