That reminds me, my new favorite phrase is "Don't get stuck on stupid," courtesy of General Honore.  If you haven't had a chance to see the video, here's a little bit of the footage.<br />
<br />
It seems like I deal with someone every day who is "stuck on stupid."  I'm going to overuse the shit out of this one in my everyday conversations.  That email above is a good example of someone who's stuck on stupid.<br />

Hey.  I want to make a headboard and footboard for my bed out of my parent's front doors.  They got new ones by the way, I didn't just steal them and leave them doorless.  Anyway, after I strip and stain them, do you think you could secure the boards on for me and attache them to the bed frame when y'all come next Saturday or Sunday?<br />
<br />
Shelly<br />
</blockquote><br />
That's my friends for you.  Are there other people who would have been compelled to clarify that they didn't just steal the doors right off their parents' house?<br />
<br />
If you were wondering, I never made them into a headboard and footboard.  I have somehow convinced my friends that I am capable of things like wiring and carpentry, when I am in fact completely incompetent in these fields.  But somehow, I bullshit my way past requests like this, and no one is the wiser.<br />

No idea how you might be able to use this on theskinnyonbenny.com, but seeing the urinal photo made me think of a photo I took last year in a men's room at the Guggenheim in NYC.  Those curved walls make for an interesting bathrooms.  If ever I saw a water closet, this was it.<br />

Awesome contribution!  When I think about it, I do have enough experience with odd commodes to put a whole page up just on that single topic.  Unfortunately, I never thought to take pictures of most of them.<br />
<br />
One night, we went to eat at a dive of a restaurant on River Road way outside of Baton Rouge.  The sit-down toilet in the men's room was jammed into a corner due to lack of space.  They had a makeshift stall around it, and that stall had a little, angled door.  But the door was hung in a way so that the bottom of the door would come to about mid-chest as you sat on the can.  So the door would protect your identity, but it would be not so useful in truly protecting your privacy.<br />

Okay.  There are a couple of guys putting up film on our windows in the<br />
office to cut down on glare.  I was walking down the hall and could see my<br />
reflection in the glass of the artwork hanging at the end of the hall.  And<br />
I could also see one of the guys totally checking me out as I walked.  I<br />
would have been totally self-righteously offended by this a few years ago.<br />
Today, it's all good.  In fact, it's so good, I'm inspired to take a turn<br />
at Tyler's art and write a haiku:<br />

Tyler Cummings has changed my life.<br />
<br />
Wait, okay, that's not true.  But I have been inspired by him.  Since my first attempt (which I like to call the "gleeful ass" haiku), I've started keeping a haiku journal, which I think is the most fabulous thing in the world.  It's short and quick - just one haiku a day - so it's totally manageable, unlike a regular journal.  It forces you to be concise, picking only one event from each day to memorialize.  And it ends up being a real journal of interesting things that I actually want to remember (vs. I had an important meeting at work today. I was on a power trip because I was wearing really tall heels.  I introduced a great design idea.  Blah blah blah-blah-blah.).<br />
<br />
I highly recommend it.  It's therapeutic.  It's easy to do.  It forces creativity.  As soon as I figure out how to set up a blog, I'm doing it so we can all participate in haiku therapy together.<br />
<br />
Some sample entries of my own:<br />

Suzanne is onto something, even if that something isn't the best ability in  the world to count syllables.  Writing these is not as easy as you might think.  Email me if you want a permanent home for your haiku journal on theskinny.<br />

One day, I got an email containing only this photograph, copied from the Hibernia internal company web site.  The subject line is "Ich Bin Ein Berliner."<br />
<br />
The sender (who was not Mrs. thesskinnyonbenny, even though she does work there) swears that this is unedited.  Even the grainy black and white effect is apparently accurate to the original web page.<br />

                   //Ever hear of a CString?<br />
   _variant_t vNull;<br />
   vNull.vt = VT_ERROR;<br />
   vNull.scode = DISP_E_PARAMNOTFOUND;<br />

</blockquote><br />
This one came to me through the office.  This is a sample of code found when modifying a program.  The comments are from a guy called Brad, who is no longer around.  I don't know why he left the company, but one can speculate that his unnecessary anger at simple things (like other programmers' source code) might have had something to do with it.<br />
<br />
Did he not notice that the inputs "foo" and "Which" were declared as CString?  Who's the fuck-head now?<br />

I've been making fun of a job description that Stacie wrote that included the qualification, "Must be able to read and interpret a document."  Anyone who would disqualify himself for that is a moron indeed.  But "Ability to deal with ambiguity" is even better.<br />
<br />
At least the hiring manager is honest.  This requirement can be translated in the job description to, "You will not be given clear direction.  You should be prepared to take blame for poor decisions made for lack of guidance.  Credit for good decisions will be retained by your supervisor."<br />
