Somewhere in the harbor, we caught a fishing net, and as we approached the fuel dock, it got a good wrap on the propeller.</p><p>You probably know that boats don't have breaks. To slow down, we put it in reverse. So when the propeller can't spin, not only do we not have the ability to forward, but we've also lost our ability to stop.</p><p>We bounced off the dock (ouch) and started blowing toward a moored mega yacht. Missing that by a couple of feet, we got a tiny bit of anchor down. Luckily it was enough to hold, but little enough that our dangerous swinging kept us from hitting two nearby anchored boats. Somewhere in there was a mad dash to reset a tripped breaker for the windlass, but it was so fast that I don't now where in the process that happened.</p><p>Once we ascertained that we were more or less safe, I went for a swim and sawed the prop free.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_2318.jpeg" data-lightview-caption="The liberated fishing net" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_2318.jpeg" alt="/img/bigtrip/resIMG_2318.jpeg" style="max-width: 650px;"><br><span class="caption">The liberated fishing net</span></a><p>From there, we were able to get back to the fuel dock, fill up, and get to a med moor for the stay.</p><p>As soon as I went to the marina office, I knew we were out of Europe. The breeze was warm instead of cool. The whole area was lively, and there was music playing. It turned out that there was music everywhere -- the sounds of live bands singing in Portugese or in their Creole filtered out into the streets at night. And in the day, you could walk through streets and hear rehearsal wafting through a window.</p><p>On top of that, the people were very nice, there is boat service by very competent people at the best prices I've seen. Food and drinks were cheap too.<br><br>Before we even officially checked in to the country, I scheduled the boat repair that we needed, and an unbidden laundry lady showed up to handle our sweaty clothes. That left us to mostly wander around, eat, and drink for most of the time that we were there.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_2334.jpeg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_2334.jpeg" alt="/img/bigtrip/resIMG_2334.jpeg" style="max-width: 650px;"><br><span class="caption"></span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_2336.jpeg" data-lightview-caption="You know how you go to the beach, and it's never as pretty in the pictures as it is in real life?

We probably won't see land again until the end of the week. The forecast was for no wind at all, but so far, we've been able to sail or motor sail quite a bit. That's a good thing, because it was a borderline proposition whether we had enough fuel to motor all the way there or not.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://theskinnyonbenny.com/big-trip/ships-fog-undocumented-immigrants-and-an-orca</guid><title>Ships, Fog, Undocumented Immigrants, Africa, and an Orca</title><description>The title is a good recap, but this covers an eventful few days where we wrap up our time in the Mediterranean and sail into the Atlantic Ocean.</description><link>https://theskinnyonbenny.com/big-trip/ships-fog-undocumented-immigrants-and-an-orca</link><pubDate>Fri, 5 Apr 2024 11:43:00 -0100</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I mentioned it in <a href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/video/night-watch---strait-of-gibralter/">a video that I posted during the wee hours this morning</a>, but let's talk more about the orca swim-by that happened yesterday morning.</p><p>We set out from a Spanish marina that is right on the border with Gibralter. When we pulled out into the bay, we pulled into a pretty thick fog bank. For a little bit, we were going to find a spot close to shore to anchor. But as we motored toward a spot that I picked out on the chart, the visibility got a little better, so we inched forward very slowly.</p><p>It was kind of eerie. We were constantly passing the shape of huge container ships outlined in the fog, accompanied by the music of various ship horns sounding near and far.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_2139.jpeg" data-lightview-caption="Foggy at Gibraltar" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_2139.jpeg" alt="/img/bigtrip/resIMG_2139.jpeg" style="max-width: 650px;"><br><span class="caption">Foggy at Gibraltar</span></a><p>Vanya and I were at the stern (back of the boat) coiling lines and putting away fenders. He saw the big mammel lift up out of the water right beside him. I didn't turn until I heard it take a breath, and I saw a huge black curve, longer than our boat is wide sliding back down into the deeper water.<br><br>I was right by the helm, and I threw the boat into hard reverse. <a href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/blog2/orca-strating-a-passage/">This was a manuever I've been mentally practicing for months</a>.</p><p>She (I'm going with female but who knows) didn't show herself again, and she didn't bump the boat at all. My heart, on the other hand, pounded as hard as it ever has for a good half hour.<br><br>The intense day was just getting underway. As soon as we got out into the open water, a huge ferry was zooming towards us at a speed faster than boats should go, even while sounding their fog horn. That was the beginning of several hours of constantly calculating where giant ships would be, while they all traveled at slightly different speeds and angles. We were under sail downwind in a strong blow, and we couldn't maneuver freely due to fear of an accidental <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jibe">jibe</a>.</p><p>I need to back up and talk about why were in Spain rather than in Gibraltar to begin with. Cruising rumor has it that there's a marina in Gibralter with big private bath tubs, and that is very appealing to me.<br><br><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_2118.jpeg" data-lightview-caption="I'm not sure why this rock is so famous.

This is a treaty amongst most of the EU countries (and maybe a few that aren't EU) that lets you check in to Europe and just bounce from country to country without going through customs and immigration at every new place. Americans are allowed 90 days inside of Schengen out of every 180, and our time is pretty much up.</p><p>We went to Spain to clear out, and save our remaining few days to legally tour the Canary Islands, which are also part of Spain. But it turns out that when we exported the boat from Slovenia, they also stamped us out of the country in our passports. We didn't know, and we didn't check in on the next stop, so we had been travelling illegally since the first week of February.</p><p>The Spanish border police were very nice. They conferred amongst themselves for a little while and then just decided to stamp us in as if we had just shown up by boat, and then stamp us right back out. It took us longer to find the right building than it did to get our passports straight. My catch phrase for them is "No lines, no fines, no jail time!"<br><br>Now, we're headed South along the Moroccan coast. Once we turned the corner and were in the Atlantic Ocean looking at Africa, everything changed. It went from cold to warm, the wind died down, and insects showed up. All of that in the space of an hour. It's wild over here.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_2130.jpeg" data-lightview-caption="Someone wanted a photo in front of the big rock but couldn't handle the bright light in the sky." data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_2130.jpeg" alt="/img/bigtrip/resIMG_2130.jpeg" style="max-width: 650px;"><br><span class="caption">Someone wanted a photo in front of the big rock but couldn't handle the bright light in the sky.</span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/dolphin.jpg" data-lightview-caption="One of these stupid little bastards actually did bump into a rudder, and then it swam off in a hurry, no doubt sore and embarrassed." data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/dolphin.jpg" alt="/img/bigtrip/dolphin.jpg" style="max-width: 650px;"><br><span class="caption">One of these stupid little bastards actually did bump into a rudder, and then it swam off in a hurry, no doubt sore and embarrassed.</span></a>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://theskinnyonbenny.com/blog2/geofenced</guid><title>Geofenced</title><description>I encountered a technology this week that I haven't come across before.

Normally, that would be a source of great joy for me, but this time, not so much.</p><p>Theskinnyonbenny family went on our first full provisioning run in a couple of months. We're liquor-drinking Americans with two teenage boys, so we can set a grocery store's stockholders into fits of rapturous joy.</p><p>Yesterday, we had two carts full, a lot of which was heavy -- potatoes, cat litter, and bottles of water, beer, soft drinks, and I'm not even sure what else. I know we didn't have wine. We're still packed to the hilt with Croatian and Italian wine.</p><p>Our thought -- actually a suggestion that one of the other sailers in town made -- was to just walk the shopping carts from the store down to the dock. It's less than a 10 minute walk. Then, we would unload and bring the carts back.</p><p>When the first cart made it to the edge of the parking lot, one of its wheels locked up. V tried to shove harder, and it looked like it was fighting back. In a minute, all of the wheels were bricks.</p><p>The second cart got to about the same place and did the same thing. We realized that the shopping carts were somehow geofenced, and started lugging super heavy shopping bags in a series of trips.</p><p>Ko speculated that they must really have an issue with carts being taken by homeless people before almost immediately realizing that we haven't seen a single homeless person in Europe. Just imagine the time and expense of geofencing ones shopping carts. Now all of that just to prevent boaters from using them as dock carts.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://theskinnyonbenny.com/big-trip/biding-time</guid><title>Biding Time</title><description>A week and a half since my last post, and there's really not much new to report.

We wander the town, and we're a little tired of every bar and restaurant. We've come to know a healthy percentage of the local British population, just from happening to be seated near them at cocktail hour one night or another. Last Thursday, we went to a random going away party, and it happened to be an outgoing dog lover who had introduced herself to Rosie and then to the rest of us at a different place earlier in the stay.</p><p>The wind continues to blow us away, in both the literal and figurative senses. We turned the Pegasus crew loose to make their way home after they had worked around the clock for 10 days or so, leaving me to roll on a couple of coats of bottom paint. I did it in the wind, and the gale would lift sheets of paint up out of my paint tray and blow it over my head and face. Last Tuesday, I was too paint-covered to drop in and see my Scottish friend perform at the Irish Pub's open mic night.</p><p>Easter weekend brought our first real rain, and we huddled in our tiniest apartment to watch movies.

We kept moving along the southern Spanish coast in reasonable winds. But the winds had just been really blowing for several days, and the sea state was still pretty agressive.</p><p>By morning, we came to realize that we had some damage. We stopped at Almiramar, where we had planned to stop for a day or two anyway. But instead of leaving, we went ahead and had the boat hauled out of the water for inspection. We found a problem with the potential to be quite serious.</p><p>The good people from Pegasus were on site to help in a day, and they sent a team of experts from their shop with a truck full of supplies immediately. There are three guys working every hour of daylight right now, and we're optimistic about getting back underway next week.</p><p>Meanwhile, we play tourist in Almiramar. There's a huge English-speaking contingent here, and everyone has been very nice. The town is basically a giant zig-zagging marina, surrounded by probably 3 miles of bars and restaurants, and then those surrounded by apartment buildings. There are lots of parks, and the weather is sunny and nice. Each end of town ends in a large beach, but the water is still pretty cold. We're getting a lot of work and school done. But that's about it: work/school, check on the boat, go for dinner and cocktails. There's really not a lot more to do.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240312_121353_IMG_2022.jpg" data-lightview-caption="I've definitely seen uglier boat yards." data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240312_121353_IMG_2022.jpg" alt="/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240312_121353_IMG_2022.jpg" style="max-width: 650px;"><br><span class="caption">I've definitely seen uglier boat yards.</span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240315_141800_D3093609-5AB6-4864-AE23-CADBFE324A11.jpg" data-lightview-caption="We rented an apartment for our stay.

It's like Miami, if a huge road construction project and windy, cool weather caused a lot of the businesses to close for a bit. You can get anything you want there -- boat services, Indian food, night club action, herpes (presumably). We found a place with excellent food and Sangria, and passed a pleasant few days waiting for a good weather window.</p><p>We chose to leave on a Friday night where the forecast was for 20 knot winds on our beam. It turned out to be a night with 25 knots on the bow, which is a much, much more unpleasant sailing experience. But we plowed through the night with a double-reefed main and a bit of jib flying, with winds gusting to 30.</p><p>The seas kicked up, and it was uncomfortable and annoying, We had some miscommunication about who was latching hatches, so it was also wetter inside the boat than it should be. The waves were enough to spray up over the cabin fairly regularly.</p><p>Here's how it looked from the chart table in the middle of the night. Volume up, if you're where you can.</p><iframe width="872" height="491" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uLhMsYtoRgQ" title="" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe><p>Around sunrise, I was just getting up to end my night watch, and the auto pilot went out. We were still 20 miles away from Ibiza, and the wind was still coming from the direction we needed at an insane speed. I started the motor, and we plowed into the chop, hand steering through the cold salt spay for four hours.</p><p>When we arrived, we found that the anchor had shaken loose in storm and pounded the shit out of our bow. Our formerly beautifully painted bow. The shaking had also ripped the door to the forwardmost cabin right out of its frame.<br><br>It's been cold and windy in Ibiza, which doesn't help with the frustration. But in just a few days, we've made a lot of progress on repairs and cleanup, and in a couple more days, we'll be able to move along. A fiberglass guy is going to patch us up "good enough" so that we can move on safely, and then when we're in a place that's warmer and cheaper, we can haul out to complete the repair, sanding, and painting.</p><p>Most of my latest pictures are close ups of hull damage and steering mechanisms. I didn't even make a snap on the way to the laundromat.</p><p>First, a few pics from Palma, Mallorca:</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240220_082117_IMG_1717.jpg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240220_082117_IMG_1717.jpg" alt="/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240220_082117_IMG_1717.jpg" style="max-width: 650px;"><br><span class="caption"></span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240220_083920_IMG_1718.jpg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240220_083920_IMG_1718.jpg" alt="/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240220_083920_IMG_1718.jpg" style="max-width: 650px;"><br><span class="caption"></span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240221_121846_IMG_1738.jpg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240221_121846_IMG_1738.jpg" alt="/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240221_121846_IMG_1738.jpg" style="max-width: 650px;"><br><span class="caption"></span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240221_124429_IMG_1741.jpg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240221_124429_IMG_1741.jpg" alt="/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240221_124429_IMG_1741.jpg" style="max-width: 650px;"><br><span class="caption"></span></a><p>x</p><p>And not much from Ibiza, but there was at least a nice sunset in the marina.<br><br><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240225_184530_IMG_1802.jpg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240225_184530_IMG_1802.jpg" alt="/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240225_184530_IMG_1802.jpg" style="max-width: 650px;"><br><span class="caption"></span></a></p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240225_184737_IMG_1804.jpg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240225_184737_IMG_1804.jpg" alt="/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240225_184737_IMG_1804.jpg" style="max-width: 650px;"><br><span class="caption"></span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240226_091330_IMG_1805.jpg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240226_091330_IMG_1805.jpg" alt="/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240226_091330_IMG_1805.jpg" style="max-width: 650px;"><br><span class="caption"></span></a><p>I'm not posting pictures of my damage just yet.

Another day yet, and we were to Sardinia.</p><p>We chose a marina in a quiet little town that is mostly shut down for the winter. We took a taxi into town and had a five-star meal, but other than that, it was mostly boat chores and laundry.

But I neglected to get any practice on closed-loop furlers, and as I pulled out sail, the furling mechanism was wrapping itself around the sail instead of just unfurling line like a drum furler would have. V and I went forward to get things untangled. but the wind had a good grip on the bit of the sail that had gotten let out. I asked for the boat to be steered into the wind so that the sail would luff, and when the boat turned, it went right over one of the sheets on that sail that was half deployed.</p><p>If you sailed to Cuba with us, or if you heard tales of our Cuba trip, this will sound familiar to you.</p><p>The line got caught in the prop (of course), which means no more motoring. We dropped the big sail to the deck and bungeed it into an ugly bundle. Then, under main sail alone, we sailed close to a pretty little beach and dropped anchor.</p><p>We had to find all of the components of the hookah dive system. I had secretly hoped to never use it again.</p><p>And the best advice that we got before leaving for this trip was to go buy a used wetsuit, just in case.</p><p>We got things sorted, and it took me forever to work up the nerve to swim under water. I kept going under and finding that I couldn't breathe. Eventually, it dawned on me that I was clenching my jaw so tight that I wasn't letting any air out.</p><p>The line wasn't on tight. I just had to unwrap it, maybe seven or eight times. I wasn't under the boat more than 75 seconds or so, probably, but I was nervous like I was diving a blue hole.</p><p>After that, we had a couple of drinks and enjoyed being anchored on a warm afternoon. Then, we put all of the gear back away, wrestled the sail and tangled lines into storage, and set off again. I'm tying this at 4:00 AM local time, and our beautiful weather window is over. There's no wind out here at all.</p><p>At some point, I'll do some technical videos about our sail rigging, but I have a lot left to learn first.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_9013.jpeg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_9013.jpeg" alt="/img/bigtrip/resIMG_9013.jpeg" style="max-width: 650px;"><br><span class="caption"></span></a>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://theskinnyonbenny.com/big-trip/underway</guid><title>Underway</title><description>We shove off and set sail for home.</description><link>https://theskinnyonbenny.com/big-trip/underway</link><pubDate>Tue, 6 Feb 2024 14:31:00 -0100</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On Saturday morning, we finished buttoning up the boat, motored to the Izola fuel dock, and then motored over to the nearby town of Portrose to officially export the boat from Slovenia.

We had chartered similar boats, and we were excited to do some coastal cruising on our own schedule. As we grew our confidence, we started overnight passages and then venturing farther and farther offshore. And we might have sailed it a bit harder than she was meant to be sailed. Not in a dangerous way, but in the way of robustness.</p><p>I see that clearly now that we've moved aboard Hazagussa, the red Pegasus that you saw briefly in the last post. The Pegasus components -- sailing hardware especially, but pumps, hatches, and all sorts of minor pieces too look and feel so much bigger and sturdier.</p><p>The list of things that I never had to troubleshoot, replace, or repair on the Beneteau is as follows:</p><ul><li>any of the winches</li><li>water heater</li><li>a little pump at the bottom of the freezer to remove meltwater. However, the freezer was broken as often as not, so this pump didn't get put through the paces like the rest of the boat.</li></ul><p>So it's a little bit funny that the boat thing I've done most since we moved aboard is troubleshoot the water heater.</p><p>For most of us, it's not a big deal, because we're at the dock, and hot showers are a short walk away.<br><br>But I don't think I've written yet that one of our capable and able crew, namely Heather, is somewhat less capable with a broken ankle. The marina has accommodated us by allowing us to pull side-to on a long floating dock rather than make her try to cross a gangway. But getting on and off is an adventure, and it's not been the best weather, so she opted for an ice water shower.</p><p>Other than the hot water thing, living aboard again is so great. The salon is big and full of light, and we're all in here without being on top of each other during the rainy days. The cat has find a way to squirm under the salon table, and he has himself a little spot that floats him above strands of cabling. We'll have to put a blanket in that spot for him on Velvet Elvis.</p><p>We even cooked home made food yesterday for the first time since we arrived.</p><p>As I write, it's blowing out there:</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/IMG_20240119_112555_IMG_1315.jpg" data-lightview-caption="This shows that in the last hour, the average wind speed has been 19 kts, with gusts up to about 32." data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/IMG_20240119_112555_IMG_1315.jpg" alt="/img/bigtrip/IMG_20240119_112555_IMG_1315.jpg" style="max-width: 650px;"><br><span class="caption">This shows that in the last hour, the average wind speed has been 19 kts, with gusts up to about 32.</span></a><iframe width="1034" height="582" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aeep-JfdU-g" title="" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/IMG_20240119_100038_IMG_1314.jpg" data-lightview-caption="This is one of my favorite pictures that I've ever taken.

We're looking at some time next week before she's in the water, and then there's still a lot to do before we can put Slovenia behind us. But that's the nature of travel, and in particular of sailing. We definitely want everything to be right on the boat first.</p><p>We've gotten to go to the shop and do a lot of technical learning, and seeing how everything is being assembled is invaluable. And we have a company where the owners know where every wire is run and every hose is plumbed, and they seem eager to stay on the phone with us and get us where we want to be when we want to be there.

Here's our plan for the next couple of weeks. Send good vibes for cooperating weather.</p><p>Jan 8: We arrive in Slovenia. Rent car, check in to apartment, buy cat litter.</p><p>Jan 9: Boat school starts. Go to Kranj to see <em>Velvet Elvis</em> in person and start learning her systems. Boat school continues with combinations of visits to the boat yard and on board a sister ship in the marina at Izola.</p><p>Jan 12: Keel arrives at boat yard from the keel manufacturer. Ours is the first Pegasus with the shoal draft keel. This delivery is somewhat delayed, but the good folks at Pegasus are planning to keep it in the shop and do its prep work over the weekend.</p><p>Jan 15: Transport the boat to the ocean. This should be a big day with some good pictures.</p><p>Jan 16th &amp; 17th: Install keel, step the mast, install rigging, and get the boat into the water. Maybe not in that order.</p><p>Once the boat's in the water, we can start unloading the pallets of our stuff that we shipped up there and moving into the boat. We can also get to the starlink dish at this point and get it installed. We also start a series of test sails where we make sure everything is working, instruments are calibrated, etc.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://theskinnyonbenny.com/blog2/unseasonal-decorations</guid><title>Unseasonal Decorations</title><description>Now that I don't have to get a kid up and make him get ready for school, I can start my mornings with long walks with the dog.

It's been nice to take in the neighborhood Christmas decorations at a walking pace. But this week, I noticed a couple of decorations whose seasonality is questionable:</p><p>About a week too early for Mardi Gras, but forgivable, given how early Fat Tuesday is this year.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/unseasonal-1.jpeg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/unseasonal-1.jpeg" alt="/img/unseasonal-1.jpeg" width="650px"><br><span class="caption"></span></a><p>Halloween decorations disguised as Christmas decorations</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/unseasonal-2.jpeg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/unseasonal-2.jpeg" alt="/img/unseasonal-2.jpeg" width="650px"><br><span class="caption"></span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/unseasonal-3.jpeg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/unseasonal-3.jpeg" alt="/img/unseasonal-3.jpeg" width="650px"><br><span class="caption"></span></a><p>I absolutely love the Halloween-turned-Christmas decorations. Put them up once in early October, apply a minor tweak on the first weekend of November, and then leave it alone until early January. Soooo much less up-and-down with boxes of decorations.</p><p>I hereby challenge all decorations manufacturers to make things like this ubiquitous. Lights are obvious. One switch for orange. Flip it in November for white or red or green or blue It seems like fake spider webs could become fake snow banks pretty easily. Werewolves that become reindeer. This shouldn't be too hard.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://theskinnyonbenny.com/blog2/2023-christmas-shenanigans</guid><title>2023 Christmas Shenanigans</title><description>Every year, I create a big photo book from our activities over the year.

Photo unrelated to this story for the most part...</span></a><p>It's a painstaking task. I arrow-down one by one through about 10,000 pictures we take over the course of a year, and pick the best few hundred to include. I let the web site arrange them, but then I have to go in and move things around, group them more logically, and give more prominence to better pictures. I'm usually doing this at 2:00 in the morning.</p><p>One of the pictures I selected from after my Dec. 2022 cutoff date as a picture that my whole family took at my dad's graduation. He had finished up his PHD in music composition. Either by going with the auto-generated placement or by accidentally doing a small drag with the mouse, I absolutely botched the placement of this one.<br><br>I cut my dad (the graduate) out of the picture, but left in his advisor, who is just a total random stranger to all of the rest of us.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/botched-portrait.png" data-lightview-caption="That's Dad's graduation robe, over to the left." data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/botched-portrait.png" alt="/img/botched-portrait.png" width="650px"><br><span class="caption">That's Dad's graduation robe, over to the left.</span></a><p><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/greenline.gif" class="greenline" alt="{{divider}}" /></p><p>The week before Christmas, I baked some Christmas cookies. One of my favorites has been a fig cookie, where I make a filling of mixed figs, raisons, brandy, sugar, chopped nuts, and spices, roll it into a tube, surround that with cookie dough, slice into pieces, and bake.</p><p>I don't know what I did wrong on this one, but my dough was very close to being a batter instead. I ended up having trouble shaping the cookies, and then for some reason, I had a lot of leftover filling.</p><p>I found that I could roll the filling into the size and shape of one of Rosie's turds, and it would look 100% authentic. Then, I spent two days where everyone who would come over would have to see me swear about the dog turd on the floor, followed by me picking it up bare-handed and finally taking a bite.</p><p>I didn't take a picture, and I don't even deserve to have a web site any more.</p><p>The best reaction I got was from V, whose eyes went wide with shock when I picked up the fake turd. Once I took a bite, he laughed and called me a jerk. The bite really gave up the prank. I should have tossed it in the trash and then absent-mindedly licked my fingers.</p><p><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/greenline.gif" class="greenline" alt="{{divider}}" /></p><p>Listen to some of my dad's music:</p><iframe style="border: 0; width: 350px; height: 470px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2357875700/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/transparent=true/" seamless><a href="https://danschultz.bandcamp.com/album/selected-compositions">Selected Compositions by Dan Schultz</a></iframe><p>I'll add that you should listen more than once. It can be tough to digest at first, but it grows on you as you get more familiar with it.

We drive out in the parts of rural Louisiana that are in the hour or two from Baton Rouge, and there's not really another time that we get to these parts of the state. I forget from one year to the next that rolling hills of East Feleciana Parish are kind of pretty. Even more so with the little bit of changing leaf color that we see up there. It's not New Hampshire in September, but it's prettier than you would think.</p><p>The drought this summer pretty much wiped out most of the cypress trees that we favor. We had to go back to a tree farm that we has sworn off in the early aughts when a mean woman yelled at us for strapping our tree to the roof of a soft top Jeep Wrangler.<br><br>I didn't realize that we were going back to that place, but I recognized it instantly. I asked Mrs. theskinnyonbenny if she remembered the insulting nickname that she gave to the mean lady, and she pulled it from her memory pretty quickly.<br><br>As is usual, this is also the first day of the year that I start listening to Christmas songs. also marks the first listening of Christmas music.<br><br>I'll be Home for Christmas. Christmas (Baby Please Come Home). Home for the Holidays. In short order, the radio got me thinking about how soon it will be that the kids our out of the house, living their own lives, and I can only hope that they'll chose to come home for holidays over visiting their partners' parents or going to a destination with friends. I started to get choked up.</p><p>Put another way, I almost started to cry over something that might theoretically happen several years from now. So when it actually happens, just assume I'll be a worthless pile of figgy pudding for a few days.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/gal/180%2520-%2520December%25202023/resIMG_20231202_112936_IMG_1043.jpg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/gal/180%2520-%2520December%25202023/resIMG_20231202_112936_IMG_1043.jpg" alt="/img/gal/180%20-%20December%202023/resIMG_20231202_112936_IMG_1043.jpg" width="650px"><br><span class="caption"></span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/gal/180%2520-%2520December%25202023/resIMG_20231202_114752_IMG_1047.jpg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/gal/180%2520-%2520December%25202023/resIMG_20231202_114752_IMG_1047.jpg" alt="/img/gal/180%20-%20December%202023/resIMG_20231202_114752_IMG_1047.jpg" width="650px"><br><span class="caption"></span></a><p><a href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/gal/180%2520-%2520December%25202023/">Here are a bunch more photos</a> from our December.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://theskinnyonbenny.com/vid/family-home-videos</guid><title>Family Home Videos</title><description></description><link>https://theskinnyonbenny.com/vid/family-home-videos</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Dec 2023 17:48:18 -0100</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://theskinnyonbenny.com/big-trip/more-photos-from-the-build</guid><title>More Photos From the Build</title><description>Not really to much writing to do here, but we do have a lot more pictures from the good people at Pegasus.</description><link>https://theskinnyonbenny.com/big-trip/more-photos-from-the-build</link><pubDate>Thu, 7 Dec 2023 14:36:00 -0100</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Not really to much writing to do here, but we do have a lot more pictures from the good people at Pegasus.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/IMG_2748.jpeg" data-lightview-caption="Main cabin is coming along.

"But it's their hooooooommmmmmee," you whine. I can hear you. Outside of sailing forums, the people tend to be on the side of the orcas. The New York Times article about this week's sinking ends with this thought:</p><blockquote>But the ocean is the orcas’ home, and conservationists say scaring the animals is not a solution.
<br /><br />
“It is not about winning a battle, because this is not a war,” Mr. López said. “We need to be respectful.”</blockquote><p>So we don't see eye-to-eye.</p><p>A strategy that seems to be working is keeping to shallower water. No attacks have been recorded in depths less than about 60 feet. So we do that over there for sure.</p><p>We'll also crank up the human noises, to be as unpleasant as possible.</p><p>Oh, and that might be a good time to dump the cat's litter box. Orcas can't possibly want cat shit in their blow holes.</p><p>("Cat Shit in Their Blow Holes" is not a bad band name. You can have it for free.)</p><p>I also have this idea that if they come to our rudders, I switch to full-throttle reverse. First, if they're approaching from the stern, and the boat passes their head, they have to circle around to get back to them. Orcas don't have reverse, do they?</p><p>Second, in reverse, the motion of the boat and the suction of the prop are going to pull the orca toward the prop. They're too strong to suck them in to the prop and hurt them, but it might well be annoying.</p><p>But hopefully, we don't see the orcas at all.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://theskinnyonbenny.com/blog2/travel-update-site-update-social-butterfly</guid><title>Travel Update, Site Update, Social Butterfly</title><description>There are a lot of upcoming changes to the site, as I still try to get all of the old stuff re-posted.

But nevertheless, I was 12 years old when the school year started, and my school had a student smoking area.</p><p>Before my junior year, we moved and my high school did not have a place for students to smoke. The bathrooms reeked of stale smoke. That sounds like an improvement over the normal school restroom smells, but it was not.</p><p>Not long ago, my barber and I came up with the idea of poo-scented vape cartridges for the high school kids of today to use in their school restrooms. It's a punishment-proof way to vape, since no one will question that scent coming out of a restroom stall.</p><p>If either of us had any ambition, we'd be rich by now.</p><p>On a technical note, I don't think I've ever embedded an instagram post before, and the amount of text in their embed code is staggering. I bet half of this page that you're seeing is embed code. Probably a bunch of stuff that links you and me together in the algorithms, which is why every time you log on to the internet for the next couple of weeks, you'll see ads for Truck Nutz.</p><p>Update: all of that code just rendered a white rectangle with a link in the middle to take you off-page.

Let's call him bloody-lip. So we start a scene where main character mom goes to bloody-lip's house to talk to bloody-lip's parents. He tells us that his dad is out of town, and that his mom is around back having a tennis lesson. Main character mom walks around back and spys the other mom banging the tennis instructor.</p><p>And after that, they all go to school for that morning.<br><br>So their universe is bathed in broad daylight at like 6:00 AM, everyone is up, and the mom has a tennis lesson/sexual liaison scheduled for that early on a school day.</p><p>After school <em>on that very same day</em>, she goes back to that house for a giant party. In the course of the school day, they've set up the yard with tables and chairs, put up a huge stage with lights for live musicians, and had a giant nude sculpture of tennis-banging-mom carved from a block of ice.<br><br><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/penelope.jpg" data-lightview-caption="The company that sets up parties in this town does a killer job." data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/penelope.jpg" alt="/img/penelope.jpg" width="650px"><br><span class="caption">The company that sets up parties in this town does a killer job.</span></a></p><p>Then, they have 200 people over for a shindig when the husband is either still <em>out of town</em> or has just gotten back.</p><p>This is the worst example, but the dialog is full of things that real people wouldn't say.

I had just been up a long time, finished my coffee, and wanted something cold to drink so I could sit outside to start my work day. I like sometimes to sit on the plaza outside of the main library. There is shade, power outlets, a steady trickle of people to watch, and a fountain for background white noise.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/work20230908.jpg" data-lightview-caption="At the library this morning." data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/work20230908.jpg" alt="/img/work20230908.jpg" width="650px"><br><span class="caption">At the library this morning.</span></a><p>But it's still so hot outside, even at 8:00 AM. So I need a drink.</p><p>While adding ice to the cup, there was a woman next to me filling her. She sounded very much like Aunt Esther from Sanford and Son when she exclaimed, "Thank you, Jesus!"</p><p>I was briefly possessed by Larry David. "I've got to ask... What is it with the coke machine here that's bringing you so much joy?"</p><p>I was expecting something like "there's been no syrup in the Dr Pepper dispenser for three days and now there is" or something like that.</p><p>But I got, "I'm just happy that God thought I should wake up this morning."</p><p>I guess, yeah, being alive hits for me too.</p><p>She started walking to the registers talking to herself about being alive, and that's what really answered my question: crazy.</p><p>If you have to be crazy, crazy and happy to be alive beats the shit out of crazy with demons. Last time I worked on the library's patio, I didn't stay long, because a guy behind me was ranting at an imaginary enemy. He repeated, "You're just a broke motherfucker. You about about to be a dead motherfucker." If he wasn't behind my back, he wouldn't have been scary, but then again, I didn't want to look up and make eye contact with him either. Color me as a guy who wants to stay on the "broke motherfucker" side of his ledger.</p><p>Getting back to Circle-K, the new robot check out things are the best new invention of 2023.

It's a nice break, because it's been as hot as it's ever been. This is rough for me. I'm not getting younger or skinnier.</p><p>The weekend was absolutely brutal. I went to pick up my temporarily (I'm sure) repaired Jeep, and I found North Louisiana to be full of hazy smoke. In the afternoon, we tried to sit outside and watch football, but it was just unbearable, even in the shade and the fans on. We went in and cooked all evening, like we do when it's too cold to be outside.</p><p>On Sunday morning, I could smell the smoke when I stepped outside. I drove early to Slidell, and the wildfire smoke just east of Baton Rouge was even worse than the smoke from the day before. I had to haul some heavy stuff from back where the boats are to my temporarily-repaired Jeep, and the heat had me wheezing. I was about an inch from puking. When I was finished, I checked the temperature, and it was 106. Definitely the hottest weather I've ever tried to be active in. And hopefully, the hottest ever again.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/smoky.jpg" data-lightview-caption="Sunday morning was smoky as hell just outside of Baton Rouge." data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/smoky.jpg" alt="/img/smoky.jpg" width="650px"><br><span class="caption">Sunday morning was smoky as hell just outside of Baton Rouge.</span></a><p>After that, there was a Krewe of Lyonesse pool party.

It saves me an hour in the morning, with a shorter drive, but more importantly, with not getting stuck in a neighborhood with two ways in and out along with 1000 other parents trying to drive the same roads at the same time.</p><p>It changes up my routine. There's a coffee shop two blocks away, and I've been going there a lot of mornings to start my work day. I've come to like the regulars. There's a samall group of dudes who seem to span every race, age, and income level who sit out there, smoke cigars, and yuck it up starting at 8:00 am. When there's no one at the counter, the staff is out there with us too.</p><p>I'm down there early enough to park alongside the curb right in front of the store. I have yet to pay the newly-installed parking meters down there. We all know that the ticket writers here don't work in bad weather, and it's hotter than the devil's taint out here, even that early in the morning.</p><p>After working for a few hours today, I had the table covered with laptops, an ipad where I was making notes, my phone (the <a href="https://knowledgefight.libsyn.com/841-like-a-pearl-before-a-swine" target="_blank">Kowledge Fight podcast today</a> was a lot of fun), and my coffee. I was about 20 minutes into a Teams call for work, and I saw the meter maid working his way up the street.</p><p>It was instantly a mad scramble. I was stuffing shit into my bag willy-nilly, sloshing coffee all over myself. My hurried hands couldn't find the dexterity to untie the dog from the table, and when I was finally into a position to bolt, I nearly darted out in front of a car and killed the dog and me both. Rather be dead than have a $20 ticket, apparently.</p><p>By the fact that I had time to type this out, you may have already concluded that I lived. And, I did not get a ticket. And, my call was on mute, so it all happened with my colleagues blissfully unaware.</p><p>I would love to know what the cigar-smoking regulars thought of my mad dash.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://theskinnyonbenny.com/blog2/driving-blues</guid><title>Driving Blues</title><description>It's been a lot of driving lately.

Camp pickup wasn't until 10:00. We left from there and drove until the wee hours. 11 states, and it was all bumper to bumper traffic from Maine through New Jersey. Around sunset, it the traffic got better. From Northern Virginia to home was another really long slog, fed by Red Bull and Twizzlers, which leaves you feeling shitty for a couple of days from there.</p><p>Then -- I don't know if you've heard about this -- it's hot as hell in the south right now.</p><p>Last weekend, it was up and back to Natchitoches to get our cars and our parents' cars back where they belong, but the issue that lead us to abandon my truck for the summer trip had returned, so it's still in the shop up there. Our weekends are kind of busy right now, so I've got to find a window to sneak in another round trip to retrieve it.</p><p>And then it will be my dream vehicle for a month before the engine starts to misfire again. Mark my words.</p><p>Speaking of heat, don't force the Instant Pot open when there's still a little pressure in there. I did that last week, and here's the burn still looks today. Don't fuck around with that!</p><p>Never mind -- I'm not posting that image, but picture a grizzly red, flaky burn on a fat pale belly. No one needs that haunting their sleep</p><p>And now that we've broken the seal on pictures (at least in our midns) check out these ladies, roughly 30 years apart.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/beforeAndAfter.jpg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/beforeAndAfter.jpg" alt="/img/beforeAndAfter.jpg" width="650px"><br><span class="caption"></span></a><p>I typed out and deleted a line about their good looks (both now and in the 90s), but I feel like a giant creep sitting at my table at the age of 51, commenting on the looks of girls in their early 20s.

I'd like the feedback as to whether this is gross as hell, not that big a deal but still a bad look, or absolutely fine. Leave me a note in the comments.</p><p>Just kidding. Comments are gone too.

A good 80% of what I read happens during the summer, and long passages really lend themselves to uninterrupted reading.</p><p>One of the <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/3743890-ben?shelf=%23ALL%23&sort=date_read" target="_blank">books I read</a> this summer was <em>Remarkably Bright Creatures</em> by Shelby Van Pelt. The next paragraph has a mild spoiler, so force your eyes to jump over it if you think you might read this, and you're super spoiler-averse.</p><p>This isn't really the plot, but it turns on the event where a big octopus in an aquarium perceives something that his humans don't, and he engineers a way to make them realize what he knows. This sounds so stupid -- and it is -- but it isn't as stupid as it sounds.</p><p>But in real life, I guess they're fairly smart. Remember the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/14/world/asia/inky-octopus-new-zealand-aquarium.html" target="_blank">one who escaped from his aquarium a few years ago?</a> And that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3s0LTDhqe5A" target="_blank">beautifully-shot documentary about the guy who makes friends with an octopus</a> who lives in his favorite coastal swimming hole was just great.</p><p>You know what else about octopuses?</p><p>They taste pretty damned good.</p><p>Last summer in Croatia, we were making our way up the coast and saw that the town of Orebić was both coastal and featured wineries. So we booked a couple of nights. At our first restaurant, we asked if there was someone who could take us around to wine taste. The owner of the restaurant got on the phone, and in a few minutes, we had an appointment and a reasonable price for a drive who would cart us around and put up with us gradually getting more and more wine-drunk.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/gal/175%2520-%2520Europe%25202022%2520pt%25202%2520-%2520Coastal%2520Croatia/resIMG_20220530_120010_IMG_8255_HEIC.jpg" data-lightview-caption="Wine tasting with a view." data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/gal/175%2520-%2520Europe%25202022%2520pt%25202%2520-%2520Coastal%2520Croatia/resIMG_20220530_120010_IMG_8255_HEIC.jpg" alt="/gal/175%20-%20Europe%202022%20pt%202%20-%20Coastal%20Croatia/resIMG_20220530_120010_IMG_8255_HEIC.jpg" width="650px"><br><span class="caption">Wine tasting with a view.</span></a><p>(I'm digressing, but Croatian white wine is so good.

Mrs. theskinnyonbenny asked about uniquely Croatian experiences that we should seek out. He told us to find a place that would make a peka. It's a traditional roast, where a meat gets put into an iron pot with vegetables, set directly into hot coals, and left to cook slowly all day.</p><p>Fast forward a few days, and at a seaside restaurant in Hvar, the waitresses checked with the kitchen and came back excited to tell us what time to return the following night for an octopus peka.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/gal/175%2520-%2520Europe%25202022%2520pt%25202%2520-%2520Coastal%2520Croatia/resIMG_20220603_185903_IMG_8387_HEIC.jpg" data-lightview-caption="Restaurant view" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/gal/175%2520-%2520Europe%25202022%2520pt%25202%2520-%2520Coastal%2520Croatia/resIMG_20220603_185903_IMG_8387_HEIC.jpg" alt="/gal/175%20-%20Europe%202022%20pt%202%20-%20Coastal%20Croatia/resIMG_20220603_185903_IMG_8387_HEIC.jpg" width="650px"><br><span class="caption">Restaurant view</span></a><p>We arrived at our appointed time the next night and were ushered to the best table in the house, overlooking all of the boats anchored in the harbor.

It was a nice time.</p><p><strong>July 14</strong>: Our (borrowed) truck wouldn't start at all, so I called a tow truck and got it to a dealership in town. They were really busy and didn't have time for me, but they listened to my sob story (I might have mentioned a family of four sleeping on the floor of their local bus station that night), and they drove to a town an hour away for a part and got me out of there that day. The rest of the family got to enjoy that beautiful house. I got to enjoy fluorescent lights and a tile floor in a dealership waiting room.

Don't you know that someone joined them all on stage?</p><iframe width="786" height="801" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pLzk2Wi-kjc" title="Crystal Sings with the Party Girls" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe><p>I've been using this space to make fun of Crystal since I spun it up in 2004, and the fact that I can still be doing that makes me happy for all the work that I've put in to bringing back current. (Still a lot to do, but I'm camping by myself, so hopefully I can make a lot of progress this week or next.)</p><p><strong>July 22</strong>: We packed up and went out to find a campsite to spend a couple of weeks. I ended up in the White Mountains of New Hampshire, in a site that isn't particularly scenic, but it's a two minute walk to a pretty river, and a five minute drive to places to paddleboard or hike. I'm mostly catching up on work, but I'm going to try to do some fun stuff while I'm here.</p><p><strong>July 23</strong>: We got up, and pretty much right away drove V and H to Boston. Having attempted it two years in a row, I will declare that it is impossible to drop someone off at a Boston airport hotel without missing a turn and having to spend an extra 30 to 60 minutes winding through a spaghetti mess of streets, bridges, and tunnels. If I never drive to Logan again, it will be too soon.</p><p>After that, I bought groceries and liquor, made dinner, started a camp fire, drank a scotch, and watched my ipad by the fire pit.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/IMG_0696.jpeg" data-lightview-caption="River view from the campground where I'll be spending the next couple of weeks." data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/IMG_0696.jpeg" alt="/img/IMG_0696.jpeg" width="650px"><br><span class="caption">River view from the campground where I'll be spending the next couple of weeks.</span></a><p><strong>July 24</strong>: Mostly work from camp, but explore a little. I found a really pretty little lake close by, and I'm excited to blow up the paddle board and get out on the water for an hour or so tomorrow.</p><p>So right now, V and H are at home, and I think they have my mom's car from Slidell. Ko is at camp in Maine. I'm in New Hampshire with the dog, using my mother-in-law's car, and both of our cars plus our cat are at my monther-in-law's house in Natchitoches. I'm not sure how we unwind all of this, but I have a couple of weeks before we have to worry about it.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://theskinnyonbenny.com/blog2/summer-2023-trip-part-2</guid><title>Summer 2023 Trip, Part 2</title><description>We continued to travel north and east, to the point now where we're just about out of continent.

Hills kicked my ass, but it was a pretty day in a pretty city. Once the fam was up, we had a two-hour long French lunch at a sidewalk table. Really nice. After that, we drove to Fundy National Park, getting there very late.</p><p><strong>July 5</strong>: We woke up to a rainy day at the park, so we mostly stayed near the campsite. We did venture out to some scenic overlooks and whatnot.</p><p><strong>July 6</strong>: Fundy NP day. We ate in town, went to the pool which overlooks the ocean, and checked in frequently on the tides. The Bay of Fundy has the biggest tidal range in the world -- around 50 ft of up and down, twice a day. At high tide, the boats at the dock look normal. Halfway to low tide, they sit on a pile of mud. The sea continues to retreat, and at low tide, it must be a quarter mile out from the high water mark.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/IMG_0584.jpeg" data-lightview-caption="Low Tide, but it looks like this for several hours before and after." data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/IMG_0584.jpeg" alt="/img/IMG_0584.jpeg" width="650px"><br><span class="caption">Low Tide, but it looks like this for several hours before and after.</span></a><p><strong>July 7</strong>: More play at the park. We did some paddle boarding on a pretty lake and then took in some more pool time.</p><p><strong>July 8</strong>: Drive to Prince Edward Island and start eating nonstop. We knew PEI oysters were good because there are some fancy oyster places in Louisiana that fly them in. But eating them for cheap where they are fresh out of the water was amazing. We ate four dozen oysters over the course of the day, each dozen at a different place. We also followed them with local mussels, lobsters, and scallops. Such a great day.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/IMG_0616.jpeg" data-lightview-caption="PEI Marina" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/IMG_0616.jpeg" alt="/img/IMG_0616.jpeg" width="650px"><br><span class="caption">PEI Marina</span></a><p><strong>July 9</strong>: We hung out around PEI all morning, and then found that the ferry to Nova Scotia was out. That meant we sat in traffic to use the one toll bridge all afternoon, and then had a much longer drive around to Cape Breton, Nova Scotia.</p><p><strong>July 10</strong>: Cape Breton NP. And a long drive up to the tip of the cape to take in extremes in scary roads and scenery.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/IMG_0639.jpeg" data-lightview-caption="A cool campground at the end of the road on Cape Breton.

Here's how the first week+ of our trip has looked.</description><link>https://theskinnyonbenny.com/blog2/cws-championship-kick-off-summer-2023-trip</link><pubDate>Tue, 4 Jul 2023 09:08:00 -0100</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This summer, we're between boats, so our plan was for a long road trip. For a couple of reasons, including a big one that will just piss me off if I get into it, we got off a couple of weeks later than we had wanted to. But one of the upsides is that we had the College World Series to listen to while we waited and then while we drove.</p><p>For Monday's final, we were on the Michigan Upper Peninsula.</p><p>The universe had been dropping hints that I should be confident. During that day, we passed streets named "Tiger Way" and "Championship Drive." When we sat down at the only sports bar in Saint Ignace, Michigan, the table next to us (completely unaware of the game) had two little girls -- one in a purple dress, and one in a canary yellow dress.</p><p>They weren't the only ones uninterested in the game. The big central tv was tuned to some sitcom rerun. The speakers just played music. They tuned one corner TV to the game for us and sat us over there where we could see.</p><p>Once the dinner crowd was gone, we moved to the bar, and they did put on the audio for the last couple of innings. The staff started having fun with us. I don't think we converted anyone to being new college baseball fans, but they were at least happy for us.</p><p>I started writing this post last week, but we've been on the move. Here's a quick log of our trip so far, and just a few of my favorite pictures. More later, or maybe not -- who knows.</p><h3>Captain's Log</h3><p><strong>June 24</strong>: Leave Natchitoches. Visit Graceland. Drive well into Illinois listening to the LSU/Wake Forest baseball game stream, which is the best pitching battle ever played in a college baseball game.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/IMG_0395.jpeg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/IMG_0395.jpeg" alt="/img/IMG_0395.jpeg" width="650px"><br><span class="caption"></span></a><p><strong>June 25</strong>: Chicago. Hang with our friends Harry and Janet. Janet came down to New Orleans in January before Covid. I don't even know how long it's been since we've seen Harry, but they haven't changed a bit. We hung at the marina (non-sailers will think this is funny, but it was too windy to sail), ate deep dish, and stayed overnight on their awesome little boat.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/IMG_0439.jpeg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/IMG_0439.jpeg" alt="/img/IMG_0439.jpeg" width="650px"><br><span class="caption"></span></a><p><strong>June 26</strong>: Drive to Straits State Park campground in Michigan Upper Penensula. Watch the championship baseball game at a sports bar where no one else cares.</p><p><strong>June 27</strong>: Mackinac Island. We did an 8-mile bike ride around the whole island with Rosie jogging along side. She went from pulling the bikes to just keeping up, and she slept well once we got back to camp.

Omaha is also always the location of the College World Series. At Rocco's, visiting fans can specify their favorite team when they order a jello shot, and Rocco's keeps a leaderboard that tallies the number of shots bought by each fan base.</p><p>The previos record belonged to Ole Miss, who won both the on-field championship and the one at Rocco's last year. If memory serves, they put up a couple hundred shy of 19,000.</p><p>As I type, the leaderboard looks like this:</p><a class="lightview alignright" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/roccos-board.jpg" data-lightview-caption="Latest leaderboard at the time of this post.

</table><p>It was a given that the LSU crowd would come in to town and set the record. The city of Omaha and LSU fans have had this love affair going back to the 90s. LSU would show up big and spend big in bars and restaurants, an in return, they received fantastic hospitality. There are hundreds of LSU fans at the College World Series every year, even when LSU doesn't make it that far.</p><p>Second of all, this is a naturally heavy-drinking fan base. You know those self-assessments that ask you questions to see if you might be an alcoholic? They point to highly problematic for the most casual social drinker in South Louisiana. Seattle bars doubled-up on their orders when LSU played UW there several years ago, but by Saturday night, there wasn't a drop of burbon or vodka to be found in the city.</p><p>And third, the record was by a rival. Ole Miss, holding a record on our thing, on what we consider to be our turf? Couldn't possibly stand.</p><p>Now here's my beef.</p><p>Buying liquor that you don't plan to share or drink completely goes against the spirit of the Rocco's Jello Shot Challenge. And it goes against what we stand for as traveling fans.</p><p>The founder of Raising Cane's wanted to be a big shot, so he went in to Rocco's and ordered 6000 shots at once. I don't know how big a place Rocco's is, but I'm pretty sure that they weren't all consumed.</p><p>So I'm mentally subtracting 6000 from LSU's total. We should still hold the record by the end of the day if we don't already.</p><p>Now let's talk about what's up with Tennessee and Florida getting beat by two Christian schools.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://theskinnyonbenny.com/blog2/starlink</guid><title>Starlink</title><description>Starlink is changing everything, and some of the sailors are maaaaaaddd about it.</description><link>https://theskinnyonbenny.com/blog2/starlink</link><pubDate>Thu, 8 Jun 2023 15:29:00 -0100</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>2023 is the year that I first realized that I was seeing live posts and updates from boats in the middle of the ocean.<br><br>Not only do we land-based dreamers get to follow along, boats that run into trouble hundreds of miles from shore can get in contact with other nearby boats for help. <a href="https://www.worldcruising.com/featuresarticle.aspx?page=S638056656088518963&ArchiveID=4&CategoryID=186&ItemID=272408&src=" target="_blank">A boat crossing the Atlantic this winter lost their mast</a>.

They were rescued the same day.<br><br>On our (much shorter) crossings, we have had Iridium Go, which allows a choppy phone signal, text messaging, and is just barely good enough to get weather data while at sea. We had one pretty harrowing experience in a storm, and I used it to call the Coast Guard. I told them that we were safe, but that if they started getting a signal from our EPIRB, that it might be an actual emergency.</p><p>(And it goes without saying that this device wasn't working on our 2021 Bahamas trip. We kept close to shore for the most part.)</p><p>But I'm more than excited to add Starlink to the cruising arsenal. We tested a unit over Spring Break. While camping in a National Forest, out of cell coverage, I was able to do video calls with work while Mrs. theskinnyonbenny live streamed the Murdaugh murder trial. To say that this technology is a game-changer is a huge understatement.</p><p>But the sailors who just hop back and forth between Ft.

That's not the fun part, although the views are fantastic.</p><p>Right beside there, there's a really nice spot for a swim, and you can probably have it all to yourself.</p><p>This alone would be worth the trip.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/gal/169%2520-%2520Summer%25202021%2520Pt%25203%2520-%2520Long%2520Island%2520and%2520Lizards/resIMG_20210704_121545_IMG_2248.jpg" data-lightview-caption="Beach on North Point of Long Island" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/gal/169%2520-%2520Summer%25202021%2520Pt%25203%2520-%2520Long%2520Island%2520and%2520Lizards/resIMG_20210704_121545_IMG_2248.jpg" alt="/gal/169%20-%20Summer%202021%20Pt%203%20-%20Long%20Island%20and%20Lizards/resIMG_20210704_121545_IMG_2248.jpg"  ><br><span class="caption">Beach on North Point of Long Island</span></a><p>On your way back in, there's a real resort.

There's a boardwalk through a rocky shore that's a nice, nice walk. The abandoned bar will tease you though if you work up a thirst for another rum punch.</p><h2>Cold Beer Lane</h2><p>While driving down a dirt/sand/gravel spur, there was a sign pointing down an even lesser used road that read, "Cold Beer Lane". We're explorers, so of course we took the detour. It lead to a small little restaurant. We walked up, but it was locked up.</p><p>But as we turned to leave, someone opened the door and insisted that we come in. Music turned on, cold beer was served, and we drank beer and traded stories with a couple of locals. The guy serving us was a songwriter, and he set me up with a way to download his music, which is still on my phone. The other guy had a girlfriend in Louisiana who ignored our text messages.

A super nice guy, but it took at least 15 minutes to get a beer, a rum punch, and two cokes. He kept track of our drinks with a pencil and spiral notebook, and his glacial pace made it easy for us to do the math to figure out whether our cash would hold out or not.</p><p>Eventually, a couple of other locals came in for a drink, and he was just as slow for them.<br><br>Here's the kicker: a cruise ship was scheduled to stop on Long Island for the first time a few days later. Earnest had been told to expect around 500 guests.<br><br>Mrs. theskinnyonbenny tried to coach him up: have 100 gallons of rum punch made and ready. Have all of the beers cold and easy to get to. Cash only. Cash, drinks, next. Cash, drinks, next.<br><br>If we didn't have to leave the next day to meet friends in Georgetown (and it turns out, we didn't), we would have stuck around and worked the bar for Earnest.</p><p>But the highlight, of course, is that beach. I haven't seen one prettier, and I might never.</p><h2>Dean's Blue Hole</h2><p>I've saved the best experience for last.<br><br>Dean's Blue Hole is this spot right off the beach where the shallow turquoise water drops straight down, so there's this deep circle of dark blue right in the middle.

But let me tell you about what we can all only envision.</p><p>I swam over to the edge of the hole to watch the divers. One dive in particular. The diver took a deep breath and started swimming straight down, kicking with huge flippers on her feet. I watched her get smaller and smaller against the field of dark blue. At some depth, she started to look like CGI. After she was about the size of a grain of rice to my eye, she disappeared into the deep altogether.</p><p>I waited. And waited. And waited. And no diver.</p><p>I looked up at her teammates, resting on a floating platform above it all. They looked totally disinterested.</p><p>I looked back down, and nothing. More nothing. Still nothing.</p><p>I looked up again. It had been minutes. Many minutes, it seemed. Aren't they worried? I didn't come to see someone die down here.</p><p>After another eternity, she appeared as a speck, pushing herself toward the surface with those flippers.</p><p>It's probably the most amazing thing I've ever seen a human being do in person.<br><br><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/gal/169%2520-%2520Summer%25202021%2520Pt%25203%2520-%2520Long%2520Island%2520and%2520Lizards/resIMG_20210702_175509_IMG_2209.jpg" data-lightview-caption="One more just to show that there were also people on this trip." data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/gal/169%2520-%2520Summer%25202021%2520Pt%25203%2520-%2520Long%2520Island%2520and%2520Lizards/resIMG_20210702_175509_IMG_2209.jpg" alt="/gal/169%20-%20Summer%202021%20Pt%203%20-%20Long%20Island%20and%20Lizards/resIMG_20210702_175509_IMG_2209.jpg"  ><br><span class="caption">One more just to show that there were also people on this trip.</span></a></p><p>You've seen this link before, but <a href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/gal/169" target="_blank">more pics here</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://theskinnyonbenny.com/blog2/dont-worry-about-long-island-robbers</guid><title>Don’t Worry About Long Island Robbers</title><description>We were at Great Exuma that Summer just before Fourth of July weekend.

Fortunately, they weren't hurt.</p><p>On a couple of earlier posts, I touched on how comically bad our Summer of 2021 Bahamas trip went. But there is so much more horror to relate, that you won't get the joke that I =made when I heard this news story: "I know where that wouldn't have happened. Long Island."</p><p>Let's go back.</p><p>(Buckle up, this is a long one.)</p><p>We were at Great Exuma that Summer just before Fourth of July weekend. Our generator had long since shit the bed.

Not ideal, but it kept the batteries up so that we could get around, navigate, and generally function.</p><p>Until it didn't.</p><p>As engines will do, this one tore up its impeller. I tore the boat apart looking for the spares that I knew I had on board, but I could not find them. I did find a shop in Nassau that had them in stock and who would ship a couple to Georgetown for an extravagant fee.</p><p>The next morning Mrs. thekinnyonbenny and V went to the airport to retrieve our parts, while I tried to keep the only head (toilet) on board in semi-working condition. It's pumps' gaskets were only slightly more reliable than the engine impeller.</p><p>I believe that someone must have bought my parts an actual ticket on the plane, because the cost was up there. And it had to be paid in cash. This took up the bulk of the cash we had on hand.</p><p>I made the repair, and early the next morning, we were on our way to Long Island (the Bahamian one, not the one south of Connecticut.)</p><p>It was a couple hour sail, where we had good wind and a little rain, but no real trouble. We headed in toward a marina that was associated with a resort on the Northern part of the island, according to our cruising guide.</p><p>It turned out that the marina was a ghost town.</p><p>We poked around a bit, and walked up the road a little to see if there was a resort in shouting distance. But there wasn't, and eventually, we piled back into Velvet Elvis and sailed over the shallowest sand we could possibly have floated above. Another hour or two south brought us to a nearly empty ancchorage, with enough depth and plenty of room to swing on the anchor.<br><br><a class="lightview alignright" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/gal/169%2520-%2520Summer%25202021%2520Pt%25203%2520-%2520Long%2520Island%2520and%2520Lizards/resIMG_20210702_113806_S0512075_JPG.jpg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1" style="width:350px;"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/gal/169%2520-%2520Summer%25202021%2520Pt%25203%2520-%2520Long%2520Island%2520and%2520Lizards/resIMG_20210702_113806_S0512075_JPG.jpg" alt="/gal/169%20-%20Summer%202021%20Pt%203%20-%20Long%20Island%20and%20Lizards/resIMG_20210702_113806_S0512075_JPG.jpg"><br><span class="caption"></span></a></p><p>Long Island is this long, skinny island with a single primary road that runs from one end to the other. I think it's a tad under 100 miles long, and all of the places to eat and things to see and do are spread up and down the entire length. So renting a car is a necessity.</p><p>The island's car rental place was coincidentally right where we came ashore, and in no time, we had reserved a car for the long weekend. The catch is that like everything else on Long Island, it's cash-only.</p><p>You can see where this is headed.</p><p>On our first full day with the car, we drove to both banks on the island. Both ATMs were out of service. As we drove up and down doing other things, we tried several other ideas -- cash back at the grocery, hardware store, and gas stations was a no. There was a little truck-stop style casino, and you couldn't get cash there either. We drove North to find "the resort", and we found a strange, abandoned resort with cabins from the 70s but where the grass was mowed. No ATM though.</p><p>It started to get stressful. You see, we didn't actually have enough cash left to pay for the rental car.</p><p>In asking around, we were told that at least one beachside bar and grill took Paypal as payment. It is called Tiny's, and I was disappointed to find that it wasn't run by a 6 foot 4, 320 pound Bahamian that everyone called Tiny. It was a nice little place with a good view. Conversation flowed between tourists and locals alike. Best of all, we didn't have to count pennies because of the Paypal thing.</p><p>Mrs. theskinnyonbenny told the host about our predicament and offered a fee for a Paypal cash advance. He declined, so we ordered another drink and resolved ourselves to turn in the car early and head back to Georgetown the next day.</p><p>But then as we were leaving, his wife came out, and made the PayPal cash advance happen. I think that she even declined to take a big fee on it (which was nice, because I bet our bar tab was more than our college era monthly rent).</p><a class="lightview alignright" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/gal/169%2520-%2520Summer%25202021%2520Pt%25203%2520-%2520Long%2520Island%2520and%2520Lizards/resIMG_20210702_191642_IMG_2215.jpg" data-lightview-caption="Hanging out at Tiny's" data-lightview-group="group1" style="width:350px;"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/gal/169%2520-%2520Summer%25202021%2520Pt%25203%2520-%2520Long%2520Island%2520and%2520Lizards/resIMG_20210702_191642_IMG_2215.jpg" alt="/gal/169%20-%20Summer%202021%20Pt%203%20-%20Long%20Island%20and%20Lizards/resIMG_20210702_191642_IMG_2215.jpg"><br><span class="caption">Hanging out at Tiny's</span></a><p>And that, my friends, is why you won't be robbed by gunmen in Long Island who want you to take money out of the ATM and hand it over to them.</p><p>It's a good thing that our stay was saved, because there were some absolute highlights of the entire trip, including a couple of things that would have been bucket-list things had I known they existed. This post is getting long, so I'll write up some Long Island highlights for the next.</p><p>One more disaster to recount from these days though before I get into a positive place.</p><p>Long Island was the only place in the Bahamas that had cell towers but where our hotspot did not work. We got there on the last work day of the month, which meant that Mrs. theskinnyonbenny had urgent accounting to be completed. So we dinghyed ashore with backpack-offices in tow to find a restaurant with wifi.</p><p>Meanwhile, our swim platform was down. Also, the motor that brings it up and down was broken -- because of course it was -- so it had a line tied from the swim ladder to a winch so that we could raise and lower it.<br><br>When we returned, it was dark, and Mrs. theskinnyonbenny tripped over that out-of-place line. The laptop bag went right into the drink. It was the 2nd Macbook ruined by seawater in just a few weeks. It joined an ipad and a Kindle reader, along with tens of thousands of dollars worth of boat electronics in the circuit board graveyard that was this trip.</p><p>Happier tales of Long Island next week!</p><p>PS, I wrote about other bits of our star-crossed summer <a href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/blog2/archives/2289">here</a> and <a href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/blog2/archives/2284">here</a>, but there is actually a lot more to tell.

Clinton was around to get some credit for some treaty having to do with this little spat. I could probably be less vague if I read the article that I linked there, but I'm not gonna.</p><p>Anyway, more than one Dubliner heard our hillbilly American accents, and naturally asked if we were in town with the presidential delegation.</p><p>That was annoying, but more annoying was how often the radio played Coolio's Gangsta Paradise. I would guess that no song has ever been that big a hit in Ireland before or since. At first it was funny, as I had no notion as a stupid young American that anyone across the pond had even been exposed to hip-hop. But were they ever exposed.</p><p>This week, I see headlines pop up about the Inflation Reduction Act (which I know even less about than Irish terrorism), and some of the headlines call it the "IRA". IRA was also the name of the Irish terrorist bomber organization, and thus, I'm reminded of our Ireland trip.</p><p>And that, my friends, is why I can't get Gangsta Paradise out of my head this week.</p><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/greenline.gif" class="greenline" alt="{{divider}}" /><p>In some alternate universe, I started music blogging in 2004 instead of writing about asinine things that I had on my mind back then. In that universe, I can was on for hours about the genius of some indy band that no one ever heard of, and I have a show on Sirius XMU that airs at 2:00 AM every Sunday.</p><p>In that universe, I am very poor.</p><p>At one point last year, I decided that I was going to listen to all of <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/best-albums-of-all-time-1062063/marvin-gaye-whats-going-on-4-1063232/">Rolling Stone's top 500 albums of all time</a>, and write up a sentence or two about them. I ended up hating -- and I mean absolutely hating like you hate dead bunny rabbits -- albums number 2 and 3.<br><br>I know it's my own shortcoming. There are artists that I adore who talk about those albums inspiring them to make music. But I made myself listen to them 3 or 4 times each, and it was self-torture.</p><p>Album #4 was Stevie Wonder's <i>Songs in they Key of Life</i> which I loved so much that I abandoned my project before making it 1% of the way in and listened to Stevie's lifetime of work instead. And the first time I listened to <i>Songs in the Key of Life</i> all the way through, I found out that Gangsta Paradise is just Coolio rapping on top of Stevie's Pastime Paradise. So maybe that's really the song stuck in my head.</p><p>I swear, sometimes these posts wrap themselves up without me even having to try. .</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://theskinnyonbenny.com/blog2/pitches</guid><title>Pitches</title><description>I have some great ideas for TV shows that they should make.</description><link>https://theskinnyonbenny.com/blog2/pitches</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 May 2023 10:42:00 -0100</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last night, we watched <i>My Cousin Vinnie</i>. Probably the first time I've seen it since the 90s, and it turns out that the reason it was so popular is that it's good. It's still good. I didn't remember much other than the main plot outline, and it had me laughing.</p><p>Not just the big moments -- like when Vinnie came into court wearing the thrift shop suit, but also ones that could go unnoticed if you're playing on your phone while it's on. In one court scene, the prosecutor mentions "all our little old ancestors bank in England." As he speaks, the camera panning the jury stops for an extra beat on the face of a black lady who could have had a best supporting nomination just for the look on her face during that 1.5 seconds of screen time.</p><p>How about instead of <a href="https://variety.com/2023/tv/news/matlock-reboot-elsbeth-poppas-house-series-cbs-1235607934/" target="_blank">rebooting Matlock</a>, they back the truck full of money to Joe Peci's and Marisa Tomei's houses and have them revise their characters and solve courtroom crimes somewhere else that they don't fit in?</p><p>I have more TV show pitches, y'all.<br><br>Lucky Hank is very similar to an idea I had about a Mad Men style drama set in the English Department of a huge state university. My version would have had a lot more political maneuvering and back-stabbing, and I dare say it would have been funnier. (Topic for another day: the embarrassingly shitty state of academic buildings at LSU.)</p><p>My most flushed out idea is for <i>Neighborhood Pool</i>, an Office-style mockumentary taking place at a neighborhood pool. My ideas are exaggerated stories based on real people and events from the Tara pool in Baton Rouge, and the fact that the pool is named after a slave-owning estate from <i>Gone With the Wind</i> is just the tip of the iceberg, comedy-wise.</p><a class="lightview alignright" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/tarapool1.jpg" data-lightview-caption="Tara pool pics from 2015" data-lightview-group="group1" style="width:350px;"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/tarapool1.jpg" alt="/img/tarapool1.jpg"><br><span class="caption">Tara pool pics from 2015</span></a><p>I'll piss off someone if I get into too many details, but there are sources that I can mine for comedy that are probably universal when it comes to the neighborhood pool experience:</p><ul><li>The board member committed to an overzealous enforcement of the rules.  Especially as it contrasts to our main-cast group of heavy-drinking parents.</li>
<li>Along with that, we have speak-to-the-camera sessions with the kids of the main characters, where they are dismissive of parental involvement and have their own little dramas going on.</li> 
<li>The tanning people, committed to their hobby in spite of the fact that their skin looks like overcooked sausage.</li>
<li>The people who have their own little territory and insist on their own music, so that everyone else hears a mismash of official club music and their tired classic rock playlist.</li>
<li>Lifeguards who continuously blow the pool closed in name of lightning, even though there is no threat of bad weather.</li>
<li>The angsty teen who brings his guitar to the pool to try to catch a lifeguard's attention</li>
<li>Adults who stand in the pool and pound Michelob Ultras all day long, yet never need to use the restroom.</li>
<li>The snack bar speaker, which announces whose orders are ready in unintelligible gibberish.  (Unintelligible Gibberish would be a good name for your cover band or your next boat.)</li>
<li>In my running plot for season 1, the pool parents find out that one of the dads is going to get divorced.  This leads to all of the tanning ladies -- both married and divorced -- to throw themselves at divorcing dad shamelessly.</li></ul><p>If anyone wants to make this when the writers and studios come to terms, I'll be happy to join the writers room. I haven't even been to the pool as a guest in several years, but the comedy tap is still providing.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/tarapool2.jpg" data-lightview-caption="tarapool2.jpg" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/tarapool2.jpg" alt="/img/tarapool2.jpg" width="450px"><br><span class="caption"></span></a>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://theskinnyonbenny.com/blog2/disgusting</guid><title>Disgusting</title><description>Your author discovers his disgust index and has some thoughts on the matter.</description><link>https://theskinnyonbenny.com/blog2/disgusting</link><pubDate>Thu, 4 May 2023 09:47:00 -0100</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I think that I've been a hater of internet polls from the dawn of internet polls, and certainly since the dawn of internet polls that encourage one to share their results to Facebook.</p><p>But that doesn't mean that I'm not secretly engaging with them, ever now and then.</p><p>I very much enjoyed the <a href="https://www.idrlabs.com/food-disgust/test.php" target="_blank">Food Disgust Test</a> that's making it's rounds this week.

I boiled for the third time this past weekend, and it turns out that not all of the packages of crab boil are created equally. Zatarain's Pro Boil made for a much better batch of crawfish. That, plus a 45-minute soak rather than the 20 minutes that the packaging suggests.</p><p>(I write this here so that I can remember the next time that I boil, two years from now.)</p><p>My most succesful boil was at the first annual crawfish cookoff in support of <a herf="https://www.redstickcares.org" target="_blank">Red Stick C.A.R.E.S.</a>. The 45-minute soak time was a combination of two things. First, I had the start time wrong in my head and geared up to have them ready an hour earlier than I was supposed to. And second, when I meant to pull them out, it was pouring rain, so I decided to let them soak some more.</p><p>The turnout was good. I can't imagine how good it would have been with the beautiful weather that we've had the rest of this week. They got BR Music Studio to line up some of their student bands, and those kids were pretty good. They also brought a whole lot of people that sat there and didn't buy tickets to eat crawfish.</p><p>I don't know what sort of space aliens can sit there smelling crawfish all day and not pony up $20 for an all-you-can-eat wrist band.

She's very close to being in a state as close to full repair as is possible, afer suffering an electrical surge just about a year ago. V and I motor-sailed her back to her home dock, and for the first time in a while, I really enjoyed being out on the water.</p><p>Meanwhile, we dream of new boats. On top of the disrepair, we'd really like another cabin and another head. We even went to the boat show in Annapolis back in October to see what features and designs the manufacturers are trotting out there now.</p><p>We saw some cool boats. A couple of French manufacturers are turning out 45 ft aluminum hull sailboats with centerboards that make them draw just a foot or two. Bali catamarans have a garage-door rear wall, so the whole thing can open up and put the main saloon in open-air (at the cost of having a tiny mainsail, and oh my god when that thing starts to leak. That's how I think about boat features now).</p><p>Mrs. theskinnyonbenny also found an <a href="https://pegasus-yachts.com/" target="_blank">intriguing boat</a> online that wasn't at the show. We wathced the video tour and talked to one of the owners about some questions that we had. That turned into an invite to spend a few days aboard one of their boats followed by a visit to their factory in Slovenia. That sounded fun, and we've been wanting to do a little touring in Eurpoe, so one day after school let out, we were on a plane.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/gal/176%2520-%2520Eurpoe%25202022%2520pt%25201%2520-%2520Slovenia%2520Croatia%2520Montenegro/resIMG_20220522_203305_IMG_7983_HEIC.jpg" data-lightview-caption="Pegasus 50 Hull #1" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/gal/176%2520-%2520Eurpoe%25202022%2520pt%25201%2520-%2520Slovenia%2520Croatia%2520Montenegro/resIMG_20220522_203305_IMG_7983_HEIC.jpg" alt="/gal/176%20-%20Eurpoe%202022%20pt%201%20-%20Slovenia%20Croatia%20Montenegro/resIMG_20220522_203305_IMG_7983_HEIC.jpg" width="650px"><br><span class="caption">Pegasus 50 Hull #1</span></a><p>(These, and many many more pictures are <a href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/gal/176" target="_blank">posted here</a>.</p><p>After three planes and a train from Venice to Triste (Italy), a car was supposed to meet us to bring us the rest of the way to Izola, Slovenia. It didn't show. We "wasted" some time in a sleepy Italian town, drinking a couple of beers and watching music videos before the bartender helped us find a cab that would take a credit card (as we had not gotten any Euro-cash yet. I'm pretty sure they all call it Euro-cash.)</p><p>We got let off at the marina in Izola, and still had to hike for what felt like three hours to circle around the boats and find the vessel where we were supposed to stay. They had it open, nice and clean, and a chilled local wine and some farmer's market fruit at the ready for us. Two of the owners of the company came by an hour or so later, and we had a good time swapping sailing stories and talking boats, despite how tired we were.</p><p>By then, it was getting on toward 9:00 PM on Sunday night, and finding an open restaurant proved to be a challenge. We wandered into a bar full of guys who didn't speak English and took a little while to figure out that there was no food there. But one of the guys was super nice, and he walked us out of the building and pointed us to the only nearby local restaurant. Dinner and drinks were great, and we got our first sign that prices in Slovenia are great.</p><p>The next two days, we put the boat through its paces. She sailed great -- having a correctly-shaped mainsail with full battens really helps I think (Velvet Elvis has a main that furls into the mast. It's convenient, but the poor sail shape has lead most of the boat-makers to abandon the design.) We had a lot of light wind, and she still moved. It's probably a better boat test -- in 17 kts, they're all going to move pretty well.</p><p>The Northern Adriatic is beautiful. It has deep blue water, and the ocean is rimmed by rolling hills. The Slovenia coast line is small enough that we were able to lay eyes on both Italy and Croatia in a couple of short day sails.</p><p>Exploring Izola was fun too. It's a small seaside down, wrapping around a huge marina. Streets are clean and full of flowers, and the town is full of young people and families. Although it was our Summer, their kids were still in school, so there was a definite rhythm to the days. We mostly sat at outdoor cafes, and we kept the boat stocked with wines, fruit and cheese.<br><br>At lunch one day, the waiter came by after a long wait, and V wasn't ready to order.<br><br>"What the heck?" asked his mother.</p><p>"I was staring at the wall," he replied.</p><p>"Huh?"</p><p>"It's a really nice wall."</p><p>I turned, and indeed, it was a nice wall.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/gal/176%2520-%2520Eurpoe%25202022%2520pt%25201%2520-%2520Slovenia%2520Croatia%2520Montenegro/resIMG_20220523_152653_IMG_8002_HEIC.jpg" data-lightview-caption="A nice wall" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/gal/176%2520-%2520Eurpoe%25202022%2520pt%25201%2520-%2520Slovenia%2520Croatia%2520Montenegro/resIMG_20220523_152653_IMG_8002_HEIC.jpg" alt="/gal/176%20-%20Eurpoe%202022%20pt%201%20-%20Slovenia%20Croatia%20Montenegro/resIMG_20220523_152653_IMG_8002_HEIC.jpg" width="650px"><br><span class="caption">A nice wall</span></a><p>After some sailing days, we took the bus to Ljubljana so that we could tour the factory where the boats get made. Like all bus routes everywhere, it took a roundabout way through rural towns. It was really pretty, but took an hour longer than it should have. We were shown great hospitality by our hosts, and examining the boats in various stages of construction was pretty cool. They brought us to a local place that served us all kinds of game (bear, goat duck) prepared deliciously, along with lots of local wines. I think we spent at least a couple of hours as course after course of meats came out.</p><p>Our planned bus out of town was full, so we ended up wandering around downtown Ljubljana. I'm so glad we did. It's an energetic, lively place with lots of beautiful buildings and a river running through it, which is always a nice touch.</p><p>After a night in Ljubljana, we decided to rent a car and move on to being tourists in Croatia.<br><br>The drive to Dubrovnik took most of the rest of the day. An interesting thing is that you drive a long way through Croatia, then have to pass through Bosnia and Herzegovina, and then back into Croatia again. These countries aren't part of the Schengen treaty, which is the one that lets you pass country to country without having to do the whole border crossing dance. So that day, we had to border cross into Croatia, border cross into Bosnia and Herzegovina, and then border cross back into Croatia. That significantly increases the travel time.</p><p>We got to the gates of Old Dubrovnik just before sunset. Old Dubrovnik is the walled city with narrow alleys between blocks of buildings. It's the part of town that's thousands of years old. I appreciate that the streets are marble stone. I'll go out on a limb and declare that t's impossible for your city to look like a shit hole when you have marble streets.</p><p>We spent a few days there, doing the tourist things -- wandering around and drinking wine, mostly. The tour of the city from the walls that loom up above is exhausting but worth the effort. It rewards you with views of the town and views out over the blue, blue sea.<br><br><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/gal/176%2520-%2520Eurpoe%25202022%2520pt%25201%2520-%2520Slovenia%2520Croatia%2520Montenegro/resIMG_20220527_172626_IMG_8102_JPG.jpg" data-lightview-caption="Paddling Dubrovnik" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/gal/176%2520-%2520Eurpoe%25202022%2520pt%25201%2520-%2520Slovenia%2520Croatia%2520Montenegro/resIMG_20220527_172626_IMG_8102_JPG.jpg" alt="/gal/176%20-%20Eurpoe%202022%20pt%201%20-%20Slovenia%20Croatia%20Montenegro/resIMG_20220527_172626_IMG_8102_JPG.jpg" width="650px"><br><span class="caption">Paddling Dubrovnik</span></a></p><p>Just over a couple of large hills from Dubrovnik is another border crossing -- this one into Montenegro. We booked a room over a weekend in another walled, ancient city -- this one Kotor.</p><p>We spent a weekend in Kotor, which to me, is like a rock-and-roll version of Dubrovnik. It's less crowded, less gleaming, and less touristy, but it was still a really cool place to visit. One thing that stands out is the massive number of stray cats. It's really the only place we visited with lots of stray animals. The cats added some personality to the place. We didn't see any that looked mangy or unhealthy.<br><br><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/gal/176%2520-%2520Eurpoe%25202022%2520pt%25201%2520-%2520Slovenia%2520Croatia%2520Montenegro/resIMG_20220528_174637_IMG_8186_HEIC.jpg" data-lightview-caption="The kids play in Kotor" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/gal/176%2520-%2520Eurpoe%25202022%2520pt%25201%2520-%2520Slovenia%2520Croatia%2520Montenegro/resIMG_20220528_174637_IMG_8186_HEIC.jpg" alt="/gal/176%20-%20Eurpoe%202022%20pt%201%20-%20Slovenia%20Croatia%20Montenegro/resIMG_20220528_174637_IMG_8186_HEIC.jpg" width="650px"><br><span class="caption">The kids play in Kotor</span></a></p><p>Take a look at <a href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/gal/176" target="_blank">all the pictures</a> I've posted for this leg of the trip</a>.

This is how the trip started.</description><link>https://theskinnyonbenny.com/blog2/summer-2021-how-we-made-a-weeklong-trip-take-half-the-summer</link><pubDate>Tue, 8 Mar 2022 10:05:00 -0100</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For a week, I've been laughing at the size of John Lennon's butt crack.</p><p>I mean, that's a ridiculously long biological feature.</p><a class="lightview alignright" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/john-lennon.jpg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1" style="width:350px;"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/john-lennon.jpg" alt="/img/john-lennon.jpg"><br><span class="caption"></span></a><p>And speaking of ridiculously long features, let me tell you about how long it took us to get to the Bahamas last Summer.</p><p>We planned to leave almost as soon as school was out. We got a lot of gear stored the weekend before, and then we did a final load of gear and provisions the day before we were set to leave. I was to get up at first light and head out.</p><p>The weather was a long way from ideal. It was blowing 25 knots, straight from the direction we would be trying to travel. In fact, it had pushed so much water from the Gulf up into Lake Pontchartrain that we had to wade out to the boat in water that fluctated between shin-deep and waist-deep while walking on the deck out to the boat.</p><p>On our departure date, I started the motor, got the lines off of the dock, and started to back off. As soon as the dock was out of reach, the motor died. I tried a few times to restart it, and then I screamed for help.</p><p>That monster wind was blowing us backwards, straight down the canal, and we were getting faster and faster. A crash into someone else's dock was imminent. Mrs. theskinnyonbenny called for the anchor (which was brilliant), and we got it down in time to stop our inevitable wreck.</p><p>I still couldn't get the motor to restart, so we hit #1 on boat speed-dial, Sea Tow. They sent a guy who was helpful, but he didn't think that with the wind gusts, he could move us around safely. We sent him on his way.</p><p>I spent some time troubleshooting and found that the deisel didn't smell like deisel. We had a ton of water in there. I won't get too technical, but there's a fuel/water separator in there. I spent an hour or so pumping fuel in there, skimming the water, and repeating until we were seeing actual deisel in there. After that, the motor started right up.</p><p>Afteer that, we decided to wait for a little bit better weather to shove off again. Two days later, we took off without incident.</p><p>On our first day out, the wind was better, but still pretty string, and still right on our bow. Once we got to Mississippi, we stayed inside the barrier islands, but we were still crashing into waves steadily under motor all day. The wind and waves settled down as it started to get dark, and that's when we noticed another problem.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/gal/171%2520-%2520Summer%25202021%2520Pt%25201%2520-%2520Getting%2520to%2520the%2520Exumas/resIMG_20210522_155053_IMG_1801.jpg" data-lightview-caption="On Mississippi Sound" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/gal/171%2520-%2520Summer%25202021%2520Pt%25201%2520-%2520Getting%2520to%2520the%2520Exumas/resIMG_20210522_155053_IMG_1801.jpg" alt="/gal/171%20-%20Summer%202021%20Pt%201%20-%20Getting%20to%20the%20Exumas/resIMG_20210522_155053_IMG_1801.jpg"  ><br><span class="caption">On Mississippi Sound</span></a><p>Our AIS (a dandy little piece of electronics that draws the position of other boats while we're out underway) had been giving us problems. Other boats were seeing us on their screens, but our screen didn't show any of them. I turned on the radar so that they would show up as purple blobs, at least, and it wasn't working either. We also had one light out. That's a whole lot of the things we have on board to make sure we don't bump into big giant ships in the middle of the night.</p><p>A nighttime passage across the Mobile Bay shipping channel is stressful enough under normal circumstances. From a distance, it's hard to tell a rig from a ship. At about 2:00 AM, I was thinking, "They shouldn't be allowed to put a red light on a rig like that. People will think it's the port side of a ship," and just then, the "rig" radioed me to to ask me to pass to his stern as he entered the Bay from the Gulf. Oops.</p><p>One night of that was enough, so we put in to Pensacola for repairs. I found a super-competent guy who was able to get a new AIS and a new radar shipped overnight, and got them installed. But as he worked, other electronic components started dying. He diagnosed a lightning strike, and told us that stuff would be failing one by one all Summer long. It was a dark time.</p><p>Memorial Day weekend was on us, so we went to a nice little anchorage near the mouth of Pensacola Bay. We had anchored there a time or two before, and usually shared it with a few other boats, some fishemen, and a dolphin or two. On Memorial Day weekend, it was boat tied to boat tied to boat from one shore to the other. Take a meth lab, the shittest modern country music artist, a beach resort, and roll it into one, then multiply that by a thousand. That's what was there.</p><p>We went up the sound towards Orange Beach, maybe a mile or so, and we had nice spots to kayak, swim, and dinghy for the weekend. A couple of dolphiins popped up near our dinghy, and Rosie decided, "fuck it, I'm chasing them" and dove into the water swimming for her water-bound playmates. We found a pretty good taco truck one night. It was a decent weekend.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/gal/171%2520-%2520Summer%25202021%2520Pt%25201%2520-%2520Getting%2520to%2520the%2520Exumas/resIMG_20210530_150250_IMG_6772.jpg" data-lightview-caption="Memorial Day Weekend - Dinner on the hook" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/gal/171%2520-%2520Summer%25202021%2520Pt%25201%2520-%2520Getting%2520to%2520the%2520Exumas/resIMG_20210530_150250_IMG_6772.jpg" alt="/gal/171%20-%20Summer%202021%20Pt%201%20-%20Getting%20to%20the%20Exumas/resIMG_20210530_150250_IMG_6772.jpg"  ><br><span class="caption">Memorial Day Weekend - Dinner on the hook</span></a><p>After that, the electronics guys were tearing apart our boat to replace things for a week. The cat and I stayed on board, while the rest of the family took a rental car and headed home. Liveaboard life by oneself on a boat where all of the panels are pulled off isn't fun. I had a bike and a dinghy to use for food runs, but not much close. I pretty well wiped out our summer's supply of hot dogs. It was a week of hot dogs, watching baseball on an ipad, and getting a lot of work done.<br><br>We finally got out of Pensacola June 11. Most of our stuff was working, but we were prepared for stuff to be failing. The plug for shore power air conditioning hadn't been replaced and was unusable, but we don't spend that much time in a marina anyway. The sail to Key West was more or less uneventful, and once there, we resupplied, visited some of our favorite hangouts, and tried to avoid the Covid-laden crowds.</p><p>Speaking of Covid, we had to get V a test to get in to the Bahamas. Mrs. theskinnyonbenny and I were vaccinated and K was under the age where they care. A very nice medical professional came out to our boat, stuck the swab up his nose, and disappeared. Results to follow by email. We rolled the dice and headed out. While still in sight of Key West, a monster squall blew through and tossed us all over the place for an hour or so. That was no fun.</p><p>The rest of the passage was fine. A couple of days and nights later, we were close enough to some Bahamian islands to unbox our hotspot and check the internet. The hotspot was an ancient piece of equipment whose screen showed something like 3TB of use up to that point. It was working okay, but if you put down your device to do something else for a bit, you had to power the hotspot off and back on for it to connect again. Not ideal.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/gal/171%2520-%2520Summer%25202021%2520Pt%25201%2520-%2520Getting%2520to%2520the%2520Exumas/resIMG_20210615_172358_IMG_6794.jpg" data-lightview-caption="Resupply run in Key West.

This is my favorite pic from the trip.</span></a><p>Somewhere in here, I also had an incident where a stream of salt water spray came right through a hatch in calm seas, landing right on my computer keyboard. The computer was toast.</p><p>On June 18, we pulled in to a marina in Nassau to clear in. We had V's covid clearance, and all of the paperwork was fine. I decided to fill the water tanks while the rest of the family moved booze and gear to a charter boat that our friends would be picking up later that same evening. The waater ran and ran and ran. It was taking forever. I blamed Bahamian water pressure, but still, it had only been a few days since we filled up in Key West. After forever, I pulled up some floor boards and saw that the water was running from our aft tank straight into the bilge. We were just filling fresh water and just as fast, the bilge pump was pumping it overboard. For the rest of the trip, a high water alarm would occasionally go off because of leaking water from that tank (later identified as a host to be replaced). The alarm shrieked an ungodly, inescapable scream, which is good for a high water alarm on a boat, but still....</p><p>After a full day sail to Highborne Cay, I tried moving the SIM card from the Bahamas hotspot to a different hotspot that we keep on board. Didn't work. I moved it back to the ancient hotspot and now it didn't work either. Without data, we were going to be pretty screwed. We went to bed frustrated, and pretty much assuming that our summer trip was entirely fucked.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/gal/171%2520-%2520Summer%25202021%2520Pt%25201%2520-%2520Getting%2520to%2520the%2520Exumas/resIMG_20210618_201634_IMG_2024.jpg" data-lightview-caption="Finally there." data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/gal/171%2520-%2520Summer%25202021%2520Pt%25201%2520-%2520Getting%2520to%2520the%2520Exumas/resIMG_20210618_201634_IMG_2024.jpg" alt="/gal/171%20-%20Summer%202021%20Pt%201%20-%20Getting%20to%20the%20Exumas/resIMG_20210618_201634_IMG_2024.jpg"  ><br><span class="caption">Finally there.</span></a><p>I woke early the next morning and made a last ditch effort with the SIM card. I had forgotten about my work hotspot that I keep in my computer bag. What do you know, it worked! Summer was unfucked!</p><p>This gave us a chance to appreciate that we were in clear blue water, under sunny skies with a cool breeze.

But I've been trying to write a little bit every week, because it's fun for me. I end up in this weird place where I tell myself, "I can't post about Y because I haven't even gotten around to writing about X, and it ends up where I don't post at all." That's as dumb as you're thinking it is, so I'm just going to start posting some things here and there. It won't chronicle life sequentially, but who cares?</p><p>This Summer, we sailed again to the Bahamas. While we were there, we enjoyed beautiful days, floating above crystal clear water, with cool breezes perfect for sailing and ventilation blowing night and day. But as good as the good stuff was, we'll also remember all of the fiascos. I'll probably circle back and try to detail the broken boat equipment, salt-ruined electronics, and travel snafus, but it will be more fun to document other people's misfortune first.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/IMG_20210626_164008_IMG_6862.jpg" data-lightview-caption="Hard not to miss the Bahamas when you go through the pictures." data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/IMG_20210626_164008_IMG_6862.jpg" alt="/img/IMG_20210626_164008_IMG_6862.jpg"  ><br><span class="caption">Hard not to miss the Bahamas when you go through the pictures.</span></a><p>Our friends Crystal and Robert were due to meet us in mid-July, right before we turned toward home. The morning they were supposed to fly out, I got a call while still in bed. Robert had been denied travel, because he ordered a "passport card" instead of a passport. It's a little cheaper, and as far as I can tell, it will get you on a cruise ship, but that's about it. I really don't know why they offer such a thing. It must cause problems all the time.</p><p>They were ready to cancel, but after spending all day looking for a new plan, we found a ferry from Fort Lauderdale that could get them in. (The cards are good for boats.) So they drove all night to Fort Lauderdale and were on the boat the next morning.</p><p>They arrived in Bimini, went to clear in to the country, and they were turned away. It turns out that Crystal wasn't in a place yet where she trusted the vaccine that has been in the works for 20 years, and her negative Covid test was about 5 minutes older than Bahamian customs would allow. Back on the ferry they went, for the return cruise to Florida.</p><p>But all was not lost. Robert knew someone who knew someone who worked for a US Congressman, and this samaritan got him an appointment at the Miami passport office. So they booked new plane tickets, scheduled a new Covid test, and started the next morning at their appointment.</p><p>It turns out that the appointment was just an appointment to stand in line. For five and a half hours. If I remember correctly, you can't even bring your phone into a federal building, so they stood in line for all of those hours with nothing to entertain them other than the back of the head for the person in front of them.</p><p>On day four of their week-long vacation, they finally boarded the plane that would get them to the Bahamas.</p><p>I'm tempted to describe the days we had as packed. We did force activities into every daylight moment and plenty of the nights as well. But at least a few of those days looked like this.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/IMG_20210717_134041_S0354044_JPG.jpg" data-lightview-caption="A lot of this." data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/IMG_20210717_134041_S0354044_JPG.jpg" alt="/img/IMG_20210717_134041_S0354044_JPG.jpg"  ><br><span class="caption">A lot of this.</span></a><p>We swam with the famous pigs, and I don't remember from our previous trips that they just shit constantly. These are some really photogenic pigs, but people go through great pains to get photos that don't include pig excrement of some variety or other. The fastest I moved the entire summer was a mad scramble, 10 yards away from a pig's behind, to jump into the dinghy and get away from a floating cloud of nastiness.</p><p>We had the grotto to ourselves, free of big boats full of tourists, which was amazing. We took side trips to Little Farmer's Cay and to Black Point, which was late in the day, and where I believe at least one of us was too drunk to remember. No shame there -- we came to play.</p><p>Vanya took up some time during the week getting himself invited to visit and eat with people on big giant yachts. One night, he had free lobster curry on board, while we ate $18 hambergers 50 yards away inside the yacht club.</p><p>They ended up being able to extend their trip by a couple of days, so all we really missed out on was rest. But there's plenty of time left for that when we're dead. Or when you have a 13 hour drive back home from Fort Lauderdale to end your vacation.</p><p>After we returned, Crystal's mom made a suggestion that I ran with as soon as I heard it. We now have this trophy to pass back and forth after each time we meet up, assuming someone does something dumb enough to deserve it. (Someone always does something dumb enough to deserve it.)<br><br><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/donkey1.png" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/donkey1.png" alt="/img/donkey1.png"  ><br><span class="caption"></span></a></p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/donkey2.png" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/donkey2.png" alt="/img/donkey2.png"  ><br><span class="caption"></span></a>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://theskinnyonbenny.com/blog2/about-this-cat</guid><title>About This Cat</title><description>We went on a Covid-summer road trip that took us the whole Summer.  The cat took an entirely different Summer vacation in the Ozarks.</description><link>https://theskinnyonbenny.com/blog2/about-this-cat</link><pubDate>Sun, 2 Aug 2020 09:26:00 -0100</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>More than ever, we wanted a Summer-long trip again this year.</p><p>Another sailing trip would have been great, but even as we wound down the school year, the Bahamas closed themselves off to visitors. The writing was on the wall for the shitshow that Florida would become. And the first hurricane of the year spun up between here and Mexico. A long sailing trip wasn't in the cards.</p><p>We had done some early planning of a road trip across the Alaskan Highway, but in ignorance about its own name, the highway crosses Canada, who was equally inhospitable.</p><p>We bought the coolest little camping trailer and headed to the nearest mountains (Arkansas, it turns out). I had planned to be diligent about blooging our travels, but a mishap at the end of our first week left me not in the mood to write.</p><p>Some people put catsup on their eggs. Some people remove their shirts to poop. We took a cat on a cross country camping trip.</p><a class="lightview alignright" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/IMG_6403.jpeg" data-lightview-caption="Maks watches another camper pitch his tent at one of the early stops on our trip." data-lightview-group="group1" style="width:350px;"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/maks-camping-1.jpg" alt="/img/IMG_6403.jpeg" width="350px"><br><span class="caption">Maks watches another camper pitch his tent at one of the early stops on our trip.</span></a><p>Here's my defence: Maks isn't a normal cat. He's mostly like a dog. He (often) comes when you call, he doesn't wander off on a male cat quest to get laid, and he's pretty damned loyal to the refilling of his food bowl. He likes strangers just fine, and likes his family quite a lot. Sometimes, he even comes along when I walk the dog, trotting unleashed beside us.</p><p>For the first three or four stops, it played out like I had expected. Maks might disappear into the woods for a bit, but then he'd come back and hang with us. At night, he joined us in the camper. He was never out of sight for more than an hour or two.</p><p>Then, at a pretty little camp site by the White River in Northern Arkansas, he failed to return. We waited several hours, and then several days. We walked around calling him incessantly. We offered campground kids lucrative rewards. The whole campground was on lookout.</p><p>After a week, it was hard to imagine any scenario other than him slipping into the luggage compartment in the belly of an RV that was on its way out. We waited for the phone call from some nearby town, or Tennessee, or Vermont. Who knows? We left Arkansas and worked our way West without a word. I'll write about so many of the places we visited, but for the purpose of this post, just know that we saw places that I've heard about my whole life, along with several spots that I should have heard about, also along with a few great camping spots that I think people are keeping secret on purpose. All of this an no phone call.</p><a class="lightview alignright" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/maks-camping-2.jpg" data-lightview-caption="In the back seat, you find room where you can on the last leg home." data-lightview-group="group1" style="width:350px;"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/maks-camping-2.jpg" alt="/img/maks-camping-2.jpg" width="350px"><br><span class="caption">In the back seat, you find room where you can on the last leg home.</span></a><p>Until a day, five or six weeks later. We were in a desert in South-Central California. The phone rang, and Maks was hanging around in the campground where we had last seen him. At that point, we were closer to the moon than we were to Arkansas, but we started the longest, hottest, most boring drive that you can devise across these United States. It's a blur of red dirt and scrub brush, and not one of those Bugs Bunny cacti with the two upward pointed arms. We stopped twice to sleep, but both stops were short. I'll turn 50 next year without having seen the Grand Canyon.</p><p>(Now that I think about it, I did see it from the window of a flight in to Vegas once. Does that count?)</p><p>Some nice people met us in a small town WalMart parking lot, and just as suddenly as he had disappeard, Maks was home. He had to have been so surprised to come out of the carrier and find himself face to face with the people he had probably written off as lost. Rosie gave him the excited dog reunion greeting that dog owners get when they get home from work every day. Ko's level of excitement excited me. Vanya's lack of excitement surprised me, but he explained that he never thought that Maks <i>wouldn't</i> be back, so it was just an expected part of the trip to him.</p><p>Maks has settled back into his normal routine, which is pretty much just walking around meowing at people to feed him or pet him. He keeps close enough to see or hear someone in the family. One morning this week, he joined the dog and me on our morning walk.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://theskinnyonbenny.com/blog2/quarantine-year-one</guid><title>Quarantine, Year One</title><description>I never really understood how a change of scenery keeps my work from being oh-so-boring.

I've actually had a lot to do, and interesting things to work on. I've got a view of every out-building on the 3900 block between Claycut Rd. and Capital Heights, and I'm still itching for a change.</p><p>Last week, we went out to work from the boat. That was a nice change, but lead to boat repairs (of course) and the logistics of moving food and booze from place to place while trying not to go to a store.<br><br><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/IMG_6724.jpeg" data-lightview-caption="All the outbuildings:  the view from my balcony, where I work in nice weather, since it's a lot better than the view from my desk." data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/IMG_6724.jpeg" alt="/img/IMG_6724.jpeg"  ><br><span class="caption">All the outbuildings:  the view from my balcony, where I work in nice weather, since it's a lot better than the view from my desk.</span></a></p><p>At home, Mrs. theskinnyonbenny fired the people who had started to replace our back deck, so for a week or two, I had that to do with my spare time. I'm way behind some of you on the binge watching, but when I start, I'm just not finding anything I want to stick with. I'm only about 90 minutes into Tiger King, and to be honest, that's probably it for me.</p><p>This morning, I made this list of mealtime rules to be in effect until the end of quarantine.</p><b>Breakfast</b><ul>
<li>If you're heating up a bagel or making toast, knock yourself out.</li>

<li>As soon as your breakfast involves turning on the burner to an oven (eggs, bacon, or pancakes), make an offer to the rest of the house, and if they want some, make more.</li>
</ul><b>Lunch</b><ul>
<li>During the quarantine, there is no such thing as lunch.  If you get hungry after breakfast and before dinner, make a sandwich or snack of some sort.  Mom and I are working, and we're not gonna scrutinize your nutrition during the day.</li>

<li>If there is leftover dinner from yesterday, you may not complain about not having anything to eat.  This applies, no matter how distasteful you find the leftovers to be.</li>
</ul><b>Dinner</b><ul>
	<li>After a day at my desk followed by cooking for you, the last thing I want is for you to pop up from 6 straight hours of video games to tell me the food is gross.  We're eating pretty damn well for people who aren't going to the store every day.  Make a plate and take a taste of everything.  If you don't eat it, it will be there for lunch tomorrow.
</li>

I've probably mentioned it somewhere in these pages, but it's a fun day every year. Our house is somewhere very near mile 23, and we pull out the lawn furniture and turn up some music and spend the morning watching the fit people pass. Our neighbors have come to join us for the only morning of the year where we have no traffic.</p><p>The later in the race you get, the more social the racers, so towards the end, we end up sharing beer and champagne. This year. we made a couple of pitchers of banana daiquiris which were popular with the athletes.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/IMG_6403.jpeg" data-lightview-caption="Line that was supposed to hold my fat ass." data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/IMG_6403.jpeg" alt="/img/IMG_6403.jpeg" width="650px"><br><span class="caption">Line that was supposed to hold my fat ass.</span></a><p>One lady asked for a beer when we had no more with us at the street. I jogged inside to grab one from the fridge for her. When I brought it out to her, I breathed heavy, "I'm so tired. I ran all that way."<br><br>She had about 0.25 seconds of sympathetic face before it dawned on her and she came back around to "Shut UP!"</p><p>I've got a good pic of the dog watching the parade that belongs in this post, but it was already a little bit too photo-crowded. Take a look at it as a <a href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/dailyphoto/%3Fyear=2020&month=1&day=29">daily photo</a>.</p><p>Saturday the next weekend, we went to Velvet Elvis to try to resolve a lingering rigging issue. I was all strapped in and ready to be pulled to the top of the mast, when I felt a pop. My weight went back to my feet which were back on deck. A few seconds later, the halyard I was going up on floated down onto my head. No joke here. Fortunately, the line broke while I was an inch off the ground. A few minutes later, I would have been falling from the height of a two-story building. Pshew!</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/IMG_6404.jpeg" data-lightview-caption="LSU Natatorium" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/IMG_6404.jpeg" alt="/img/IMG_6404.jpeg" width="650px"><br><span class="caption">LSU Natatorium</span></a><p>Sunday was a swim meet. V swam in the early session, and K in the afternoon, which meant that I was in the nautitorium for about 7 or 8 hours, when you figure in warm-ups etc. I didn't see a soul that I knew there. I managed to listen to some decent tunes, and read a little bit of a decent book, but mostly, it was watching kids swim.</p><p>The morning session warmups included about 300 kids by my rough calculation. Each of three pools was full to kid-density that you see here. (There's one more pool to my left, and another one under the diving boards at the other end.) Then, there were two shifts, each as crowded as the other. That's a lot of swimming kids.</p><p>While waiting for K's second race. he flipped through my phone pics, and found this one.

I've managed a few, but there's an almost constant clomp of kids mvoing in and out. Practice times are staggered between the different groups of kids. and it takes a while between the time I get there and the time when things calm down.<br><br><a class="lightview alignright" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/waitingatswim.jpg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/waitingatswim.jpg" alt="/img/waitingatswim.jpg" width="270px"><br><span class="caption">This is where I blog now.</span></a></p><p>There are daily reunions of kids that go to different schools, all with news to share. There's the steady vibration dropping bags, pulling off shoes, kicking shoes back on to wet feet. On dry workout days, there are more interludes for hurried stripping of outerwear and then rushing back to swim lanes. It's even hard to sit and read, much less try to fall asleep.</p><p>Audiobooks work okay, but what I really like to do is to make up names and stories about the kids and parents that I see coming and going. And if I'm really being honest, I'm not creative enough to make up stories -- I just mentally file them into the tropes from John Hughs movies.</p><p>There's one young kid, waiting for an even younger sister, who is never without his small, purple LSU football. I want to ask him to throw it around, but he's been taught not to talk to strangers, and I'm too worried about seeming like a weirdo, so we both just sit, bored and quiet.</p><p>By 5:45 or so, eveyone who is swimming is usually at their practice, leaving four or five parents plus a couple of siblings spread out in the bleachers. You can start to hear the echoey pop music playing through the natatorium speakers, probabbly from one of the coach's phones. I wonder if I could catch a quick nap.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://theskinnyonbenny.com/blog2/how-to-championship</guid><title>How to Championship</title><description>Every time that one of my teams plays for a championship -- an experience that I may or may not ever have again -- I get better at how to do it.

And I'm here to share my wisdom.</p><p>*(I hear some of you saying that LSU played for a title after the 2011 season too. I remember the SEC title game that year, but I don't believe they played again after that.)</p><p>After the 2003 season, a friend of ours went out and bought a brand-new huge-ass TV. Unfortunately, he didn't bother to upgrade his cable plan to include the HD channels, and I didn't think that anyone was still watching low-def football. So I only got to see a giant blurry representation of the game. That's lesson number one. Make sure you know where you're watching.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/championship-night-early.jpg" data-lightview-caption="Ready for the game to start on Monday night." data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/championship-night-early.jpg" alt="/img/championship-night-early.jpg"  ><br><span class="caption">Ready for the game to start on Monday night.</span></a><p>For the championship after the 2007 season, we went down to New Orleans to be in the mix. Not to go to the game -- just to be near the game. V was just a tiny little toddler, and we navigated the French Quarter with him on my shoulders.<br><br>After an hour or so, we were headed into Napolean House for a round of cocktails when a stranger ran up saying, "Man! You can't let your kid wear these!"</p><p>I set V down and saw that someone had given him a strand of penis beads. For those of you now acquainted with New Orleans, that's not some weird sex thing -- it's just a strand of beads that has plastic genitalia where the round things normally are. V had placed the beads over his head and worn them around while riding on my shoulders. It's anyone's guess as to how long he was up there like that. I would love to be able to read the minds of the few people who saw him and were aghast.</p><p>One Mardi Gras not too long after that, he was on my shoulders when a religious nutjob started yelling to me about being a sinner. "He's going to grow up to be a fornicator, if you don't get him out of New Orleans!" he shouted.</p><p>"I should hope so. Why wouldn't I want my grown son to have a happy sex life," I replied. This lead to much laughter from the poor saps who were just trying to watch their parade in sin-loving peace.</p><p>So maybe lesson two is that you shouldn't bring toddlers to the French Quarter. But to be honest, the penis beads were funny, so if you can avoid the zealots, I think the French Quater and toddlers mix just fine.</p><p>When the Saints made the Super Bowl, we headed back to the French Quarter again, this time without children. (In fact, it was V's birthday, but we just lied and told him that his birthday was the following weekend. Little kids believe anything.)</p><p>We pretty much had the championship day thing down by then. It was a nearly perfect day. We had good drinks. We ran into friends. We ended up with a good screen where we could watch the game. When the game was over, the whole bar spilled out into Burbon Street and I hugged and danced with strangers for quite a while.

An outlet works fine without a ground wire, but should the day come where the vacuum cleaner develops a short, it won't trip our breaker. Instead, it will just sit there, charged as the devil's own lightning, waiting to shock the shit out of whoever touches it.</p><p>The standard screws that come with the outlet don't work either. The sheet rock is a lot thicker than today's, so longer screws are needed to reach the outlet box.

This week, I took those mind-wanderings and started typing them out as a post.  Whose music is dentist-office appropriate, but still good?  Let the debate begin.</description><link>https://theskinnyonbenny.com/blog2/the-best-artist-that-no-one-hates</link><pubDate>Wed, 5 Dec 2018 11:46:00 -0100</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was at the dentist last week, forced into captive listening to the light rock radio station in town for the first time since the last time my teeth were cleaned. I like to pretend that the hygenist is a torturerer, trying to get important secrets out of me. I urge the government to never entrust me with important secrets, because even though the metal hook probing my tender, neglected gums feels kind of good, my brain is still screaming, "I'LL TALK! I'LL TALK."</p><p>The music this particular day started surprisingly good. We started with Kings of Leon followed by Imagine Dragons. It had me wondering whether I was such and old dad that I might need to dedicate a preset button to the light rock channel. I've forgotten who was up third, but I remember thinking that it wasn't bad. Up fourth was the inevitible airing of Phil Collins's "In the Air Tonight." No one has been to the dentist and <i>not</i> heard In the Air Tonight since 1987.</p><p>I understand that the dentists have to limit their playlists music that no one dislikes. For the past week, I've been trying to mentally think of the best artist you could choose, with the caveat that no one dislikes the music. You immediately have to strike,</p><ul><li>hard rock (sorry Van Halen and Jane's Addiction -- maybe the best two rock bands period),</li>
<li>hip hop (no one dislikes Chance the Rapper. except "I don't like rap" people, who would like it if they gave it a chance),</li>
<li>anything with unusual chords or chord progressions (Radiohead and Arcade Fire -- it was nice while it lasted),</li>
<li>jazz, blues, classical, opera, etc.  There are vocal critics who hate it all,</li>
<li>any pop or dance music that's too electronic or funky,</li>
<li>anything too twangy,</li>
<li>anything dirty (so painful to scratch Prince and Madonna off the list)</li></ul><p>What's left? Who's the best artist that everyone likes?</p><p>(Nothing and no one, to be honest, but here's what I've come up with as the best potential answers.)</p><strong>Billy Joel:</strong><p>This is thex first answer that popped into my head, and perhaps still the best.</p><strong>Dave Matthews Band:</strong><p>In their heyday, I was put off of DMB by a super irritating coworker who was super enthusiastic about DMB. Her constant prattling made me want to hate DMB, and I'm only just now getting past that.</p><strong>Tina Turner:</strong><p>Maybe my personal favorite, but not as univerally beloved as she should be.</p><strong>Coldplay:</strong><p>Radiohead without the unusualness, maybe? But along with the interesting sounds go the... well, the interesting sounds. Not sure if they belong here or not.</p><strong>Johnny Cash:</strong><p>Popped into my head late, but I think the man in black is a good addition.<br><br><strong>Avett Brothers:</strong> Potential winner here, but can you really say that everyone likes a band that unashamedly includes cellos in many tracks? I think you can, but I understand if you want to quibble.</p><strong>Hall and Oats, Huey Lewis and the News, Loverboy:</strong><p>80s hit machines, but we're looking for the best, and none of them are better than Billy Joel.</p><strong>Cage the Elephant, Kings of Leon, The Kooks:</strong><p>All super good, and I don't know anyone who dislikes them. I know a lot of old people who have never heard of any of these bands though.</p><strong>The Killers:</strong><p>Just thought of this as I was finishing up. Might be the winner.</p><p>Give me more ideas. I'm sure there are a ton.</p><p><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/greenline.gif" class="greenline" alt="{{divider}}" /></p><strong>Update:</strong><p>This sort of came up in conversation over Thanksgiving week, after I had written most of the post, but before I actually posted it. (You'd be surprised at how much I write and discard.) It seems like Billy Joel probably does win the title of Best Artist that Nobody Hates.</p><p>When I was a kid, my dad had these work friends who were nuts about being Catholic and about Billy Joel. We went to their house for what was probably a Super Bowl. My family always went to watch the Super Bowl with Dad's work friends rather than with their real friends, of which there were plenty of other gatherings. I'm not sure why.<br><br>These friends talked about how they would stay up all night, with the VCR set to record but on pause, wired remote in hand, just waiting to unpause during the first millisecond of a Billy Joel video. They had them all recorded, even though they had stayed up hours and hours into the night many times. Man we lived in a dark age.</p><p>They were also very unhappy with the church, because the Pope had mentioned that he wasn't a fan of "Only the Good Die Young."</p><p>Anyway, send me your ideas about who should be on the list.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://theskinnyonbenny.com/blog2/rotten</guid><title>Rotten</title><description>This is the shortest post ever -- a memory of a 20-year-old vulgarity that made me laugh.</description><link>https://theskinnyonbenny.com/blog2/rotten</link><pubDate>Mon, 3 Dec 2018 11:44:00 -0100</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the first times I heard Mrs. theskinnyonbenny be good and truly vulgar was on a visit to her home town.

In retrospect, I probably should have made them get out of pajama pants.

After sledding, we went out for gumbo. We came home, and they all left me alone in a hot bath, where I leaned my head back, and slept like a baby while flurries continued to fall out of my window.

(That was my college football underdog pick this week. And in case you're wondering, they did win.)</li></ol><ol start="2"><li>Is Odell Beckham Jr going to play today? (Fantasy implications, and the Giants aren't telling.)</li></ol><ol start="3"><li>Is there still such a place as Key West? (Still not quite sure what the answer is.)</li></ol><p>From there, I went through all of the college football scores from yesterday. There were a lot of good games, and I missed a lot of action. I was, however, the only person outside of Indiana or Virginia to watch the whole IU/Virginia game. Indiana is for real, y'all. That game wasn't nearly as close as the score showed.</p><p>I was instrigued by the Tulane 21 - Navy 23 score. Navy is one of those teams that I pull for, with no real reason. I like that it's one of the four D-I schools whose name is also a color. And I like that part of their cirriculum is to get out on Chesapeake Bay in sail boats. I hope our real navy never gets to the point where we rely on sail any more, but I like that they're getting the kids ready, just in case.</p><p>I always check in on Tulane too. Parltly, because my friend Dave picks Tulane as his underdog as reliably as crazies will wait out a hurricane in Key West, and partly because I just pull for all of the in state schools, assuming none of them ever get good enough to challenge LSU.</p><p>I'm wondering if CBSSN replays games during the week, like the ESPN channels do during slow fall weekdays. Google wouldn't tell me, no matter how I phrased the question, I couldn't really find anything. But I found a highlight reel on YouTube, posted by Tulane, so I decided to <a href="https://youtu.be/NqOENqJj4lk" target="_blank">watch it</a>.</p><p>If you follow that link and watch, you will wonder like I did how Tulane didn't win 45-3. I don't think I'm getting all of the highlights here.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://theskinnyonbenny.com/blog2/shipping-news</guid><title>Shipping News</title><description>I was helping V with a book report, and there's a giant picture of an old ship with six thousand little labels for every line and sail.

V is a big middle schooler, which to him means the freedom to mill about aimlessly before classes start in the morning, severely limited recess, and authority to use the sandwich press in the cafeteria at lunchtime. Two positives to one negative -- not bad.</p><p>He was initially upset with the combination lock instructions, being given a combination with numbers like 18 and 32, and a lock that DOESN'T EVEN HAVE THOSE NUMBERS! Once I translated 18 to "go to 20 and then 2 more ticks" and did similars for the other numbers, it was clear as could be.

I have fond memories of watching Björn Borg and John McEnroe play, so the streets were named a really long time ago. Ham Richardson is my favorite. What parents would name their baby boy "Ham?"<br><br>The only streets I didn't have to Google are Rod Laver and Chris Evert. For Chris's street, I have to think that someone in the early 80s made an effort to find a female tennis player worthy of street naming. They could have gone with Margaret Court and hidden the fact that this street was a decades-late addition, but no one thought of that.</p><p>The name is also a clue to when the street was commissioned. In the early 80s, she was Chris Evert Lloyd. I know she was married to a skier named Andy Mills later. And then didn't she marry Greg Norman in the 2000's? I'd look that up, but I already spent an inordinate amount of time trying figure out how to do the ö in Björn, so I'm going to leave the Us Weekly caliber research to you readers.</p><p>If I'm ever in charge of naming the streets in a subdivision, I'm going with the most mundane nouns I can think of:</p><ul><li>Shoe Polish Lane</li>
<li>Grip Tape Way (inspired by tennis names, I guess)</li>
<li>Talcum Powder Drive</li>
<li>Crushed Limestone Circle</li></ul><p>I could keep going. I'm not sure why this amuses me as much as it does. "Come over to my buddy Ham's house. He lives at 444 Talcum Powder Drive."

Instead, I took the helm of the motor van <i>San Clemente</i> for a tour of the Pacific Northwest. We started out north of Seattle, ferried through the San Juan Islands of Washington, crossed over the Vancouver island in Canada. From there, we crossed British Columbia and visited several Canadian National Parks in their Rocky Mountain range. Finally, we circled back into Washington for a few days before heading home.</p><p>It was an excellent trip. The people of Washington and British Columbia must be like "aw, yeah, hmmmm..." every time they go somewhere for the scenery, as it's very hard to match what they left behind. A lot like us in Louisiana sampling food at our travel destinations. (I will give the nod to Pacific oysters over Gulf oysters, but on the other hand, you pay for them.)</p><p>Several times, I've said that you could pick the ugliest two mile square of British Columbia, plop it down where the town of Shreveport sits today, and you would have a U.S. National Park that would draw millions of visitors every year. We did better than that, by accidentally falling into a promotoional year for Canadian National Parks where all admission fees were waived for their sesquicentennial.

She waved us down to use a phone, but she couldn't catch her friend. We wished her well and went to set up our campsite.</p><p>Once we were all set up, her boyfriend called back. He was something like six hours away and wanted us to bring a phone back to her so they could figure out what to do. I already had the tent up on the van and a hammock tied to the luggage rack, so the boys and I started to walk. We were right by a pretty little river, so I brought my camera along.</p><p>We were almost there, when K started screaming, "BEAR! BEAR! BEAR!"</p><p>Sure enough, a skinny black bear was crossing the road about 50 yards in front of us. I had the presence of mind to tell the kids to start walking away backwards. (Fuck that locked out lady!) Noise wasn't a problem -- never is with Kolya around.<br><br>She looked right up at us, but then moved across the road with little apparent interest. I decided to brave a picture. I fumbled with the camera forever, but finally clicked off a pic. It should have been natural. I had taken right at 1000 pictures with that camera so far on the trip. But I apparently was so freaked out of my head that I couldn't work it.

The kids will probably spill a cup of flour all over the kitchen within the next 120 seconds, but for now, this is an accurate view.</p><p>There's a reason that I feel like I need to emphasize our cleanliness.</p><p>And it's not because my sister's cleaning lady posts before-and-after pictures of her work on her website. That's the most horrifying thing I've ever read. (And yes, she's made the cut more than once.)</p><p>It's because Kolya jumped out of my Jeep at school drop off this morning, and sprinted full-bore toward the elementary building. Excited to tell his friends and teacher that he got a fright this morning.</p><p>He picked up his backpack to leave for school, only to find it occupied by a <i>giant, dying rat</i>. Fuuuuuuuuck!</p><p>Let's back up a little.</p><p>Mrs. theskinnyonbenny was working yesterday afternoon, when she spotted a rodent head poking out from the hole in the wall from where a bunch of network cable comes into the room. She sprinted out of there, and we had this text exchange.</p><p>I searched for it when I got home, but I couldn't find it. The cat was just lounging on the couch with no worries at all. I figured it poked its head out took a peek, and left. To be safe, I crammed the hole full of steel wool (rats hate it, I am told) and covered it up. Then, I put down a glue trap and locked the room up.</p><p>Kolya and I checked the trap this morning. I didn't have my glasses or contacts on, but I could see well enough to know there was no rat on the trap. Had I been wearing them, I would have seen that something had gotten stuck there, eaten the cheese, and then pried itself off. But I didn't.</p><p>Fast forward an hour, Kolya screams in fear of the rat in his backpack. I tossed it out the door, and it lay on the ground barely breathing, almost as big as the cat. It was clearly poisoned and close to death, so I'm glad the cat didn't get into a tussle and poison himself in the process.

Close to being able to drop V off. We've been side by side in the car for almost an hour, and we're still flipping through radio channels, trying to find some decent tunes that we aren't tired of.</p><p>For the 6th or 7th time in the hour, we land on the hip-hop oldies channel. It's "Banned in The U.S.A" by 2 Live Crew. We keep it on.</p><p>Maybe it's the current state of national affairs. Maybe it's that I'm a sucker for stories where the little guy sticks it to those who make the rules. I was tickled pink by <i>The People vs Larry Flynt</i>, <i>Private Parts</i>, and <i>Straight Outta Compton</i>, despite not being a big fan of Hustler or Howard Stern. (I do like a little N.W.A. now and then.)<br><br>But it strikes me that "Banned in the U.S.A" is a really good, and a very patriotic song. It's much more patriotic in its expression of "no one can trample on our right to free speech in this country" than the song it samples/spoofs. Politicians love to play the Boss's "Born in the U.S.A." at their events, presumingly having never listened to the lyrics. For you youngsters, it's an 80s hit about a guy who returns from was just to be shit on by an America who doesn't really care about his sacrifices. Again, it's hard not to think of current events.</p><p>I try to bring my mind back to the 80s. I was a member of the generation whose parents were losing their damned minds over the music. "Satanic lyrics" was in the news night after night. Record banning was the cause of the day. Three kids in West Memphis got convicted of murder with the only real evidence being that they liked to listen to metal and the adults were scared shitless.</p><p>The song ends, and another pile of poo is on behind. By now, V is at school, but I'm still in the car channel scanning. I stop on Outlaw Country. The song is Kenny Rogers "Coward of the County." It's a terrible country song released in 1979 that I heard on old dail-based radios in the 80s no less than 9000 times, but I haven't heard it in years. I settle in for one more listen.</p><p>The song tells the story of a guy who didn't like to fight. People made fun of him, but he was fine. Until one day, his wife was gang raped. Then, he fought the rapists.</p><p>Yes, for real. That's the story of the song.</p><p>Jesus H. Christ, it's a terrible song!<br><br>So to recap, parents in the 80s were okay with the rape song being on the radio all the time, but not the black kids on cassette tapes chanting "Hey, we want some pussy," a vulgarly worded, but entirely normal sentiment for young men.</p><p>Now that I've peaked your interests, I present what I promise is the only playlist to ever feature these three songs together:</p><iframe src="https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify%3Auser%3Abens4lsu%3Aplaylist%3A33FFFjxVaGGAJfahxDgt9Q" width="300" height="380" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" style="display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;margin-top:2.5em;"></iframe>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://theskinnyonbenny.com/blog2/read-this-one-aloud</guid><title>Read This One Aloud</title><description>This whole post is just one line....</description><link>https://theskinnyonbenny.com/blog2/read-this-one-aloud</link><pubDate>Mon, 1 May 2017 19:34:00 -0100</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If I lived up North, I would drive up to New Hampshire every couple of weeks to buy a hamster.

Some years prior to my trip, the boss ordered that a bunch of decades old loan documents be shredded. The lady I was working with couldn't bear the thought of the one ten thousandth of one percent chance that she might need to refer to one of the documents and not have access to it, so she stayed late one night and moved a wall of filing cabinets into the ladies room.</p><p>By the time of my visit, everyone was just used to the "don't ask/don't tell" nature of their filing system. Women strolled past the cabinets every day to do their thing. The secret hoarding of the documents was long since public knowledge, but since they were out of the boss man's sight, he never followed up on his order that they be removed.</p><p>I can't imagine how annoying that would be for me if I worked there every day.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://theskinnyonbenny.com/blog2/its-mediocre-wednesday</guid><title>It's Mediocre Wednesday</title><description>A thought I had about the days in the Easter season, plus one of those observations that kids make.</description><link>https://theskinnyonbenny.com/blog2/its-mediocre-wednesday</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Apr 2017 10:39:00 -0100</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Some comedy troupe has surly filmed this exact scene, right?</p><div style="margin-left: 2em;">

I looked up to see two cars in the road at a funny angle, and I thought they had been in a little fender bender.</p><p>The driver of the first car was a well dressed black lady of about 30. The man at an angle behind her was well over 50, white, and had a loud New Orleans accent. He surprised me by shouting joyfully, "Hey! That's great! Thank you ma'am! God bless you!"</p><p>Now for two days, I can't quit trying to figure out what made him so happy. He was holding a coffee, but they weren't coming out of a drive through, and it seems like a lot of emotion for a free coffee. Some stranger paid for our coffee and donuts at Dunkin when I drove through before school with the kids a couple of weeks ago. Don't get me wrong -- it is nice. But I didn't jump out of my car to ask God to bring down blessings.</p><p>I really can't come up with anything satisfying.</p><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/greenline.gif" class="greenline" alt="{{divider}}" /><p>No googling during the reading of this post.</p><p>A couple of weeks ago, on a long boring drive, I tried to think of band names that have a color in them. With apologies to Jack Black, Jack White, and Pink, individual names don't count. Here's the initial list I came up with.</p><ul><li>Blue Oyster Cult</li>
<li>Deep Purple</li>
<li>The Black Keys</li>
<li>The White Stripes</li>
<li>Pink Floyd</li>
<li>Green Day</li>
<li>Black Sabbath</li>
<li>Black Kids (from whom I know one song, but it's a winner)</li></ul><p>I was with some of my family the next day, and we went through my list. While I was going through my list, my sister came up with Black Eyed Peas when I said The Black Keys. Huge oversight by me there.</p><p>A week later, my dad texted me this list...</p><ul>
<li>Blues Traveller</li>
<li>The Blue Notes</li>
<li>Ruby and the Romantics</li>
<li>Moody Blues</li>
<li>The Limeliters</li>
<li>Maroon Five</li>
<li>Redbone</li>
<li>The Slivertones</li>
<li>Quicksilver</li>
<li>Vanilla Fudge</li>
<li>Cream</li>
</ul><p>I only know half of those, but I'm sure the list is legit.</p><p>I just thought of Black Flag while sitting here tying this post.</p><p>Oh! and Pearl Jam. Pearl is a color, right?</p><p>You can play too, but you have to do it all from memory.

But then again, maybe it won't be quite that bad. Here are some reasons to be happy about where we are.</p><ul><li>Our new president is actually going to care that no one turned out for his inauguration, and about how bad his approval numbers are.  He may not have the mental capacity to do anything about it, but either he'll get better, or he'll bellyache on Twitter to everyone's amusement.</li>

<li>There is no momentum at all for a full repeal of Obamacare.  It sounds very unlikely that people with pre-existing conditions will be forced to go without coverage again.  I predict a plan that looks very very much like Obamacare, and the GOP can take credit for all the lives saved by Trumpcare.  Fine.</li>

<li>Eight years ago, the GOP wanted to ban research on stem cell therapies.  No one even mentions that any more.</li>

<li>Even President Obama and Hillary Clinton wouldn't openly support gay rights when Obama first took office.  Now, our gay friends can marry in every state in the union, and that's not going to change.</li>

<li>This happened today:  <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Trump just had people stand at the Congressional Luncheon to applaud Hillary.

I got up early and hauled a small tailgate party's worth of chairs, tables, and music out into the driveway so that I could collapse exhaustedly into my chair and nurse my breakfast alcohol as healthy people who had already run 23 miles (23!) that morning passed.</p><p>The first runner passed a bit under two hours after the start of the race, which worked out to a 5 minute mile pace. The last racer was some time after the race had been going on for 5 hours, and he was accompanied by the embarrassing peloton of police cars and support vehicles that follow the last runner. I need to tip the cap to the runner who was keeping himself a few blocks ahead of last place while drunk as a skunk.<br><br><a class="lightview alignright" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/vmarathon.jpg" data-lightview-caption="V, enjoying the Louisiana Marathon of Staying In Pajamas." data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/vmarathon.jpg" alt="/img/vmarathon.jpg" width="350px"><br><span class="caption alignleft">V, enjoying the Louisiana Marathon of Staying In Pajamas.</span></a></p><p>The demeanor of the runners who pass is anything from ulta-serious (ignoring those of us who shout support with grim determination on their faces) to those who stop, eat, drink, and even take selfies with us. I'd love to get copies of those from over the years. A lot of the runners are super fun, and as you would expect, the further back in the race, the more fun the participants.</p><p>Stupidly, I didn't have a camera with me, and that caused me to miss two images that we would all laugh about for years to come. The first was escaped beagle Lily, with her ancient joints and 200% of ideal body weight catching sight of all of the runners passing from the spot she was back toward her house. She slipped into the stream of people and sprinted right along with them, ears flopping and tail wagging. She covered the half block as quickly as the runners and immediately flopped down for a happy rest.</p><p>My second missed image was Vanya, bored with holding out cups with water, nuts, or juice, asking if he can hold out a beer. I gave my assent, and he picked a 10oz can of Miller Light out of someone's ice chest and extended his arm into the river of runners. No one in the first wave took it, so he sprinted up the block to meet the next group. I looked up to see the 10 year old trying to force a cold beer onto the runners RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE COP who was there to block the intersection.</p><p>I called him home and explained how Dad didn't really relish the idea of sobering up in a jail cell. The officer mercifully pretended not to notice. (Pro tip: when a policeman blocks off an intersection near your house, walk down and offer him full access to drinks and bathrooms. They probably won't take you up on it, but they are always appreciative.)</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://theskinnyonbenny.com/blog2/2017-resolution-wipe-your-butt</guid><title>2017 Resolution: Wipe Your Butt</title><description>On Christmas morning, I went in for my morning deuce, and found that there was about three squares of toilet paper left on the roll.

I had been in both of the other bathrooms the day before, and I knew that this was the extent of toilet paper in our house.</p><p>Being full of Christmas spirit, I did the charitable thing by leaving my shorts on the floor, climbing into the bathtub, and using the spray nozzle for a warm, clean, and refreshing bidet experience. Then, when I pulled my shorts back up, they were somehow soaking wet.</p><p>No problem at home, but is there any worse feeling than pulling up your pants in a public restroom and finding that they have sopped up a puddle of mystery wetness while you did your business? When that happens to me, it takes all of my mental energy, repeating to myself, "It's just water. It's just water. It's just water..." until I'm distracted enough to forget about it. It's just the worst.</p><p>When the extended family showed up, they brought a couple of rolls in a gift bag, so the day was saved. Later, my sister reminded me that I have a box of butt wipes in there too. I'm singularly focused on those being residents of the car's glove compartment.

It started with a bright red circle with itchy, scaly skin in the middle. At other times, it was a red circle with normal skin. A solid red circle. A circle with bumpy skin that didn't itch. A circle with smooth skin that itched. This morning, it was faded to the point where it was hard to see at all. This afternoon, the former location of the circle was filled with small angry looking welts.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/ringworm.jpg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/ringworm.jpg" alt="/img/ringworm.jpg" width="350px"><br><span class="caption"></span></a><p>Here it is now, presumably in its death throes.</p><p>I'm sorry to have denied you the entertainment that a daily log of this thing would have certainly provided.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://theskinnyonbenny.com/blog2/halloween-time-recap-and-pictures</guid><title>Halloween-time Recap and Pictures</title><description>It's been like a year and a half since I got photos posted to this web site in any sort of manner that is timely enough to share.

It ended up being a really big corn maze that I suspect looked very little like its map picture:</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/cornmazemap.jpg" data-lightview-caption="Corn Maze Map" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/cornmazemap.jpg" alt="/img/cornmazemap.jpg"><br><span class="caption">Corn Maze Map</span></a><p>But we walked through as the evening turned from dusk to dark, and it was enough to spook the kids. That's ironic, because as we left, we saw the sign pointing to the actual haunted ones with the chainsaw weilding manics and zombies. The kids wouldn't even go down the wide open dark path that lead to the actual haunted maze, so Mrs. theskinnyonbenny had to go through by herself. She confirmed what I heard by talking to the mother of some other chicken littles -- that it was fun, but not particularly scary.</p><p>Saturday morning, we left the house and headed for New Orleans to piece together costumes and top that off with the Boo at the Zoo trip. Our timing was great again, and we got to the haunted train ride just as the sky flipped from dusk to dark. K got on the train full of courage and even took an empty seat in front of me. But before it pulled away, he started to falter and was back in my lap. The courage disappeared entirely as we rounded the first curve and were treated to convincing screams of a torture victim on a table surrounded by fake maniacs.</p><p>We were toward the fornt, so most of the monsters popping out of bushes to menace the riders were behind us, but by the end, he was in full blown tears. A succesful haunted train ride, in my book.</p><p>We followed up with the trick or treating, a few games, and got a couple of free Pelican-logoed selfie sticks from their setup. And then, back to the car and home.</p><p>The next weekend, we went to New Orleans for a magic show and Voodoo fest. The magic show was cool, highlighted by a nut who stuffed a coin into his eye socket and back around the back of his eyeball. I think he snorked it through his sinuses and palmed it from there, but it appeared that he cut open his forearm and extracted the coin from there. Either way, it was pretty revolting. The kids liked the escape artist dropped into a water tank best.</p><p>At Voodoo Fest on Saturday, V made me feel like the worst parent in the world by getting busted trying to sneak in one of my flasks. I didn't think they would do a thorough kid search. K was distraught that we would even make the attempt. "WHY WOULD WE DO THIS? WE'RE NOT BAD PEOPLE!"</p><a class="lightview alignright" href="http://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/gal/138%20-%20Halloween%202016/resIMG_20161029_134018_6393.JPG" data-lightview-caption="Voodoo - Play by the beer tent." data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="http://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/gal/138%20-%20Halloween%202016/resIMG_20161029_134018_6393.JPG" alt="http://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/gal/138%20-%20Halloween%202016/resIMG_20161029_134018_6393.JPG" width="350px"><br><span class="caption alignleft">Voodoo - Play by the beer tent.</span></a><p>No son, the bad people are the ones who want to take away Dad's vodka.</p><p>I joke, but it was a low feeling.</p><p>We managed to see at least most of a lot of different acts.

I wasn't really paying attention (I'm starting to notice a theme here) until I heard him say that Spanish for "tortilla" is "mordida."</p><p>I don't know any Spanish, but I do know menus.</p><p>"No, no, no. Spanish for tortilla is just 'tortilla'".</p><p>"No. That's how you say it regular talking."</p><p>I love that phrasing. I think he thinks he's learning a code.</p><p>Last night, I took the kids to a convenience store to pick out a candy after dinner. Guilt candy -- I worked and ignored them steadily until 6:00, and Mrs. theskinnyonbenny is out of town, prepping her liver for <a href="http://kreweofmuses.org/" target="_blank">Muses</a>. Normally the quicker of the two, Kolya scrutinized shitty candy after shitty candy unable to decide. Then, at the bottom of all the shitty candies on the shitty candy shelf, he spotted something that looked promising.</p><p>"What's this?" he asked.</p><p>"Ummm, that's a candy necklace."</p><p>"I LOVE IT!!"<br><br>He spontaneously danced around. Not showing off -- just 10 seconds of pure joy.<br><br>I wish we could get that sort of happiness from something we buy for 50 cents as adults.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://theskinnyonbenny.com/blog2/clemson</guid><title>Clemson</title><description>I'm going to write a whole post dumping on Clemson football, and then tell you in a single sentence that I want them to win the national championship.</description><link>https://theskinnyonbenny.com/blog2/clemson</link><pubDate>Fri, 8 Jan 2016 15:54:00 -0100</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Just as the ACC is sort of a low-rent version of the SEC, Clemson is the obvious low-rent equivalent to LSU.</p><a href=

That's a New Orleans standard, going back to when Jazz sprung up as a genere more than 100 years ago. Clemson isn't alone in this transgression. I'm fairly certain that I've heard the familiar strains during Memphis and Missouri games also.</p><p>Clemson even goes as far as to mix in purple. Here's an especially egregious combination of LSU wannabeism:</p><iframe class="centered" width="420" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tqGGf1_MC6Y" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><p>While we're making fun, this IS NOT a tiger mascot:</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/clemsonmascot.jpg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/clemsonmascot.jpg" alt="/img/clemsonmascot.jpg" width="350px"><br><span class="caption"></span></a><p>Isn't that the silliest looking thing you've ever seen? You would think it's a mascot for Tiger Unfinished Furniture in Pilsbury, Kansas. I can't believe a major college trots a cheerleader flunkie out in that costume.</p><p>In fact, I once put on a corporation's leprechaun mascot costume and wandered around at a minor league hockey game, and it was a lot better than that, even though it was made for the leprechaun being down on the ice, so his face was permanently tilted upward at about 30 degress. Wandering around the concourse, I looked like a stuck up leprechaun who couldn't be bothered to look at the little people who go to minor league hockey games. It worked out well when I ran over little kids, though.</p><p>This is a tiger mascot:</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/mikethetiger1.jpg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/mikethetiger1.jpg" alt="/img/mikethetiger1.jpg" width="350px"><br><span class="caption"></span></a><p>Or even this clown, whose head is correctly proportioned, at least:</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/mikethetiger2.jpg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/mikethetiger2.jpg" alt="/img/mikethetiger2.jpg" width="350px"><br><span class="caption"></span></a><p>For all of that, I'd rather the fake Tigers will it all than Alabama. Bama's had quite enough success for this <strike>decade</strike> century. And I would very much enjoy listening to angry drunk Bama callers into the college radio postgame shows.</p>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
