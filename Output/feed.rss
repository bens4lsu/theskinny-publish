A good 80% of what I read happens during the summer, and long passages really lend themselves to uninterrupted reading.</p><p>One of the <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/3743890-ben?shelf=%23ALL%23&sort=date_read" target="_blank">books I read</a> this summer was <em>Remarkably Bright Creatures</em> by Shelby Van Pelt. The next paragraph has a mild spoiler, so force your eyes to jump over it if you think you might read this, and you're super spoiler-averse.</p><p>This isn't really the plot, but it turns on the event where a big octopus in an aquarium perceives something that his humans don't, and he engineers a way to make them realize what he knows. This sounds so stupid -- and it is -- but it isn't as stupid as it sounds.</p><p>But in real life, I guess they're fairly smart. Remember the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/14/world/asia/inky-octopus-new-zealand-aquarium.html" target="_blank">one who escaped from his aquarium a few years ago?</a> And that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3s0LTDhqe5A" target="_blank">beautifully-shot documentary about the guy who makes friends with an octopus</a> who lives in his favorite coastal swimming hole was just great.</p><p>You know what else about octopuses?</p><p>They taste pretty damned good.</p><p>Last summer in Croatia, we were making our way up the coast and saw that the town of Orebić was both coastal and featured wineries. So we booked a couple of nights. At our first restaurant, we asked if there was someone who could take us around to wine taste. The owner of the restaurant got on the phone, and in a few minutes, we had an appointment and a reasonable price for a drive who would cart us around and put up with us gradually getting more and more wine-drunk.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://dynamic.theskinnyonbenny.com/gal/175%20-%20Europe%202022%20pt%202%20-%20Coastal%20Croatia/resIMG_20220530_120010_IMG_8255_HEIC.jpg" data-lightview-caption="Wine tasting with a view." data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://dynamic.theskinnyonbenny.com/gal/175%20-%20Europe%202022%20pt%202%20-%20Coastal%20Croatia/resIMG_20220530_120010_IMG_8255_HEIC.jpg" alt="https://dynamic.theskinnyonbenny.com/gal/175%20-%20Europe%202022%20pt%202%20-%20Coastal%20Croatia/resIMG_20220530_120010_IMG_8255_HEIC.jpg" width="650px"><br><span class="caption">Wine tasting with a view.</span></a><p>(I'm digressing, but Croatian white wine is so good. To me, it's completely different that what we get here -- crisp without being sweet somehow. I highly recommend.)</p><p>On the way to one of our early stops. Mrs. theskinnyonbenny asked about uniquely Croatian experiences that we should seek out. He told us to find a place that would make a peka. It's a traditional roast, where a meat gets put into an iron pot with vegetables, set directly into hot coals, and left to cook slowly all day.</p><p>Fast forward a few days, and at a seaside restaurant in Hvar, the waitresses checked with the kitchen and came back excited to tell us what time to return the following night for an octopus peka.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://dynamic.theskinnyonbenny.com/gal/175%20-%20Europe%202022%20pt%202%20-%20Coastal%20Croatia/resIMG_20220603_185903_IMG_8387_HEIC.jpg" data-lightview-caption="Restaurant view" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://dynamic.theskinnyonbenny.com/gal/175%20-%20Europe%202022%20pt%202%20-%20Coastal%20Croatia/resIMG_20220603_185903_IMG_8387_HEIC.jpg" alt="https://dynamic.theskinnyonbenny.com/gal/175%20-%20Europe%202022%20pt%202%20-%20Coastal%20Croatia/resIMG_20220603_185903_IMG_8387_HEIC.jpg" width="650px"><br><span class="caption">Restaurant view</span></a><p>We arrived at our appointed time the next night and were ushered to the best table in the house, overlooking all of the boats anchored in the harbor. The same server brought us two shot glasses of some horrible licorice-tasting Mediterranean liqueur. We didn't know if it was a shot or a sipper. I chose to shoot it and get it over with. We quickly ordered a bottle of Croatian white to wash that taste away.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://dynamic.theskinnyonbenny.com/gal/175%20-%20Europe%202022%20pt%202%20-%20Coastal%20Croatia/resIMG_20220603_191514_IMG_8397_HEIC.jpg" data-lightview-caption="Peka" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://dynamic.theskinnyonbenny.com/gal/175%20-%20Europe%202022%20pt%202%20-%20Coastal%20Croatia/resIMG_20220603_191514_IMG_8397_HEIC.jpg" alt="https://dynamic.theskinnyonbenny.com/gal/175%20-%20Europe%202022%20pt%202%20-%20Coastal%20Croatia/resIMG_20220603_191514_IMG_8397_HEIC.jpg" width="650px"><br><span class="caption">Peka</span></a><p>After that, we got to go visit the kitchen. We saw the pot in the coals, and the chef opened it up to show us our octopus and vegetables. He had swum out into the harbor and caught the octopus before adding it to the pot.</p><p>The whole pot got placed center-table, and we cut it up and dished it out. The meat had the texture of a scallop, and a little of that sweet-seafood flavor, but also with a rich, beefy flavor. It was very very good.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://dynamic.theskinnyonbenny.com/gal/175%20-%20Europe%202022%20pt%202%20-%20Coastal%20Croatia/resIMG_20220603_204612_IMG_8400_HEIC.jpg" data-lightview-caption="Our chef and his co-worker, who were familiar with the interstate exit they would take to come to our house.

He brought his girlfriend over to meet us (she was working in the same restaurant), and she had gone to University there with him too. They were both on track and field scholarships, and they were planning a return to the US university system to coach.</p><p>There are more pictures from this part of our trip posted <a href="https://dynamic.theskinnyonbenny.com/gal/175">here</a>.

Here's the latest log:</p><p><strong>July 12</strong>: We spent the day doing more exploring of Cape Breton, but mostly by car, and mostly through bad weather. I've had about enough of cold fog and drizzle by the end of this day.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/IMG_0658.jpeg" data-lightview-caption="Cape Breton" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/IMG_0658.jpeg" alt="/img/IMG_0658.jpeg" width="650px"><br><span class="caption">Cape Breton</span></a><p><strong>July 13</strong>: We left Cape Breton and drove a couple hours away to the prettiest house I've ever stayed in. It belongs to a friend/client, and she offered us a chance to dry out and enjoy the view while we were in the area. The kids made Mrs. theskinnyonbenny dinner for her birthday. It was a nice time.</p><p><strong>July 14</strong>: Our (borrowed) truck wouldn't start at all, so I called a tow truck and got it to a dealership in town. They were really busy and didn't have time for me, but they listened to my sob story (I might have mentioned a family of four sleeping on the floor of their local bus station that night), and they drove to a town an hour away for a part and got me out of there that day. The rest of the family got to enjoy that beautiful house. I got to enjoy fluorescent lights and a tile floor in a dealership waiting room. Not complaining though -- the trip moves on.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/IMG_7833.jpeg" data-lightview-caption="View from my favorite house.  When we speculated on what we would do with all of our winnings should the Powerball or Mega Millions hit, we decided we would 1) Make sure Red Stick Cares is funded forever, and 2) buy this house no matter what the price." data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/IMG_7833.jpeg" alt="/img/IMG_7833.jpeg" width="650px"><br><span class="caption">View from my favorite house.

We did laundry and camper cleaning, and then late, Crystal showed up with her three kids and her nephew.</p><p><strong>July 16 - 21</strong>: Beach days, cooking dinner, hang out by fire pit. We added our friends Lisa and Linda, and Camilla's friend Katie for various days during the week. On July 17, Ko left us for <a href="https://ghostlighttheatercamp.com" target="_blank">Ghostlight Theater Camp</a>. He's avoiding the camp photographer pretty well, but it seems like he's having fund when he does pop up on their photo galleries.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/3O0A7702.jpg" data-lightview-caption="One of the camp pics." data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/3O0A7702.jpg" alt="/img/3O0A7702.jpg" width="650px"><br><span class="caption">One of the camp pics.</span></a><p>We really ate well for a group that never did dinner at a restaurant. We had curry one night, steaks and kababs, a huge eggplant lasagna that I'm still craving more of, and lobster rolls. Oh, and we put a dent in all of the salmon that we've been packing since our big catch on Lake Superior.</p><p>We did go bar hopping one night, if you can call it that when there's one bar in town open as late as midnight. They were having karaoke, and there was a bachelorette party going on. Don't you know that someone joined them all on stage?</p><iframe width="786" height="801" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pLzk2Wi-kjc" title="Crystal Sings with the Party Girls" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe><p>I've been using this space to make fun of Crystal since I spun it up in 2004, and the fact that I can still be doing that makes me happy for all the work that I've put in to bringing back current. (Still a lot to do, but I'm camping by myself, so hopefully I can make a lot of progress this week or next.)</p><p><strong>July 22</strong>: We packed up and went out to find a campsite to spend a couple of weeks. I ended up in the White Mountains of New Hampshire, in a site that isn't particularly scenic, but it's a two minute walk to a pretty river, and a five minute drive to places to paddleboard or hike. I'm mostly catching up on work, but I'm going to try to do some fun stuff while I'm here.</p><p><strong>July 23</strong>: We got up, and pretty much right away drove V and H to Boston. Having attempted it two years in a row, I will declare that it is impossible to drop someone off at a Boston airport hotel without missing a turn and having to spend an extra 30 to 60 minutes winding through a spaghetti mess of streets, bridges, and tunnels. If I never drive to Logan again, it will be too soon.</p><p>After that, I bought groceries and liquor, made dinner, started a camp fire, drank a scotch, and watched my ipad by the fire pit.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/IMG_0696.jpeg" data-lightview-caption="River view from the campground where I'll be spending the next couple of weeks." data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/IMG_0696.jpeg" alt="/img/IMG_0696.jpeg" width="650px"><br><span class="caption">River view from the campground where I'll be spending the next couple of weeks.</span></a><p><strong>July 24</strong>: Mostly work from camp, but explore a little. I found a really pretty little lake close by, and I'm excited to blow up the paddle board and get out on the water for an hour or so tomorrow.</p><p>So right now, V and H are at home, and I think they have my mom's car from Slidell. Ko is at camp in Maine. I'm in New Hampshire with the dog, using my mother-in-law's car, and both of our cars plus our cat are at my monther-in-law's house in Natchitoches. I'm not sure how we unwind all of this, but I have a couple of weeks before we have to worry about it.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://theskinnyonbenny.com/blog2/summer-2023-trip-part-2</guid><title>Summer 2023 Trip, Part 2</title><description>We continued to travel north and east, to the point now where we're just about out of continent.

Hopefully better weather tomorrow.<br><br><h3>Captain's Log</h3></p><p><strong>July 4</strong>: Quebec City - I walked around the city by myself all morning. Hills kicked my ass, but it was a pretty day in a pretty city. Once the fam was up, we had a two-hour long French lunch at a sidewalk table. Really nice. After that, we drove to Fundy National Park, getting there very late.</p><p><strong>July 5</strong>: We woke up to a rainy day at the park, so we mostly stayed near the campsite. We did venture out to some scenic overlooks and whatnot.</p><p><strong>July 6</strong>: Fundy NP day. We ate in town, went to the pool which overlooks the ocean, and checked in frequently on the tides. The Bay of Fundy has the biggest tidal range in the world -- around 50 ft of up and down, twice a day. At high tide, the boats at the dock look normal. Halfway to low tide, they sit on a pile of mud. The sea continues to retreat, and at low tide, it must be a quarter mile out from the high water mark.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/IMG_0584.jpeg" data-lightview-caption="Low Tide, but it looks like this for several hours before and after." data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/IMG_0584.jpeg" alt="/img/IMG_0584.jpeg" width="650px"><br><span class="caption">Low Tide, but it looks like this for several hours before and after.</span></a><p><strong>July 7</strong>: More play at the park. We did some paddle boarding on a pretty lake and then took in some more pool time.</p><p><strong>July 8</strong>: Drive to Prince Edward Island and start eating nonstop. We knew PEI oysters were good because there are some fancy oyster places in Louisiana that fly them in. But eating them for cheap where they are fresh out of the water was amazing. We ate four dozen oysters over the course of the day, each dozen at a different place. We also followed them with local mussels, lobsters, and scallops. Such a great day.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/IMG_0616.jpeg" data-lightview-caption="PEI Marina" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/IMG_0616.jpeg" alt="/img/IMG_0616.jpeg" width="650px"><br><span class="caption">PEI Marina</span></a><p><strong>July 9</strong>: We hung out around PEI all morning, and then found that the ferry to Nova Scotia was out. That meant we sat in traffic to use the one toll bridge all afternoon, and then had a much longer drive around to Cape Breton, Nova Scotia.</p><p><strong>July 10</strong>: Cape Breton NP. And a long drive up to the tip of the cape to take in extremes in scary roads and scenery.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/IMG_0639.jpeg" data-lightview-caption="A cool campground at the end of the road on Cape Breton.

We went to town for lunch, like every other camper in the park. I think it's the only day all summer that I didn't even take a picture.</p><p>I'll post more pictures soon.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://theskinnyonbenny.com/blog2/cws-championship-kick-off-summer-2023-trip</guid><title>CWS Championship/Kickoff Summer 2023 Trip</title><description>We got off later than usual, but we're on the road again this summer.  Here's how the first week+ of our trip has looked.</description><link>https://theskinnyonbenny.com/blog2/cws-championship-kick-off-summer-2023-trip</link><pubDate>Tue, 4 Jul 2023 09:08:00 -0400</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This summer, we're between boats, so our plan was for a long road trip. For a couple of reasons, including a big one that will just piss me off if I get into it, we got off a couple of weeks later than we had wanted to. But one of the upsides is that we had the College World Series to listen to while we waited and then while we drove.</p><p>For Monday's final, we were on the Michigan Upper Peninsula.</p><p>The universe had been dropping hints that I should be confident. During that day, we passed streets named "Tiger Way" and "Championship Drive." When we sat down at the only sports bar in Saint Ignace, Michigan, the table next to us (completely unaware of the game) had two little girls -- one in a purple dress, and one in a canary yellow dress.</p><p>They weren't the only ones uninterested in the game. The big central tv was tuned to some sitcom rerun. The speakers just played music. They tuned one corner TV to the game for us and sat us over there where we could see.</p><p>Once the dinner crowd was gone, we moved to the bar, and they did put on the audio for the last couple of innings. The staff started having fun with us. I don't think we converted anyone to being new college baseball fans, but they were at least happy for us.</p><p>I started writing this post last week, but we've been on the move. Here's a quick log of our trip so far, and just a few of my favorite pictures. More later, or maybe not -- who knows.</p><h3>Captain's Log</h3><p><strong>June 24</strong>: Leave Natchitoches. Visit Graceland. Drive well into Illinois listening to the LSU/Wake Forest baseball game stream, which is the best pitching battle ever played in a college baseball game.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/IMG_0395.jpeg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/IMG_0395.jpeg" alt="/img/IMG_0395.jpeg" width="650px"><br><span class="caption"></span></a><p><strong>June 25</strong>: Chicago. Hang with our friends Harry and Janet. Janet came down to New Orleans in January before Covid. I don't even know how long it's been since we've seen Harry, but they haven't changed a bit. We hung at the marina (non-sailers will think this is funny, but it was too windy to sail), ate deep dish, and stayed overnight on their awesome little boat.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/IMG_0439.jpeg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/IMG_0439.jpeg" alt="/img/IMG_0439.jpeg" width="650px"><br><span class="caption"></span></a><p><strong>June 26</strong>: Drive to Straits State Park campground in Michigan Upper Penensula.

Omaha is also always the location of the College World Series. At Rocco's, visiting fans can specify their favorite team when they order a jello shot, and Rocco's keeps a leaderboard that tallies the number of shots bought by each fan base.</p><p>The previos record belonged to Ole Miss, who won both the on-field championship and the one at Rocco's last year. If memory serves, they put up a couple hundred shy of 19,000.</p><p>As I type, the leaderboard looks like this:</p><a class="lightview alignright" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/roccos-board.jpg" data-lightview-caption="Latest leaderboard at the time of this post.

</table><p>It was a given that the LSU crowd would come in to town and set the record. The city of Omaha and LSU fans have had this love affair going back to the 90s. LSU would show up big and spend big in bars and restaurants, an in return, they received fantastic hospitality. There are hundreds of LSU fans at the College World Series every year, even when LSU doesn't make it that far.</p><p>Second of all, this is a naturally heavy-drinking fan base. You know those self-assessments that ask you questions to see if you might be an alcoholic? They point to highly problematic for the most casual social drinker in South Louisiana. Seattle bars doubled-up on their orders when LSU played UW there several years ago, but by Saturday night, there wasn't a drop of burbon or vodka to be found in the city.</p><p>And third, the record was by a rival. Ole Miss, holding a record on our thing, on what we consider to be our turf? Couldn't possibly stand.</p><p>Now here's my beef.</p><p>Buying liquor that you don't plan to share or drink completely goes against the spirit of the Rocco's Jello Shot Challenge. And it goes against what we stand for as traveling fans.</p><p>The founder of Raising Cane's wanted to be a big shot, so he went in to Rocco's and ordered 6000 shots at once. I don't know how big a place Rocco's is, but I'm pretty sure that they weren't all consumed.</p><p>So I'm mentally subtracting 6000 from LSU's total. We should still hold the record by the end of the day if we don't already.</p><p>Now let's talk about what's up with Tennessee and Florida getting beat by two Christian schools.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://theskinnyonbenny.com/blog2/starlink</guid><title>Starlink</title><description>Starlink is changing everything, and some of the sailors are maaaaaaddd about it.</description><link>https://theskinnyonbenny.com/blog2/starlink</link><pubDate>Thu, 8 Jun 2023 15:29:00 -0400</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>2023 is the year that I first realized that I was seeing live posts and updates from boats in the middle of the ocean.<br><br>Not only do we land-based dreamers get to follow along, boats that run into trouble hundreds of miles from shore can get in contact with other nearby boats for help. <a href="https://www.worldcruising.com/featuresarticle.aspx?page=S638056656088518963&ArchiveID=4&CategoryID=186&ItemID=272408&src=" target="_blank">A boat crossing the Atlantic this winter lost their mast</a>. They were able to start their motor and get a deisel refills from other sailboats on the same route.</p><p>Another boat <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/30/world/asia/sailboat-whale-rescue-pacific.html#:~:text=After%20the%20collision%20in%20the,from%20a%20satellite%20internet%20signal.&text=When%20Rick%20Rodriguez%27s%20sailboat%20collided,sank%20within%20about%2015%20minutes" target="_blank">hit a whale in the Pacific Ocean</a>, and managed to get hold of help before their boat sank. They were rescued the same day.<br><br>On our (much shorter) crossings, we have had Iridium Go, which allows a choppy phone signal, text messaging, and is just barely good enough to get weather data while at sea. We had one pretty harrowing experience in a storm, and I used it to call the Coast Guard. I told them that we were safe, but that if they started getting a signal from our EPIRB, that it might be an actual emergency.</p><p>(And it goes without saying that this device wasn't working on our 2021 Bahamas trip. We kept close to shore for the most part.)</p><p>But I'm more than excited to add Starlink to the cruising arsenal. We tested a unit over Spring Break. While camping in a National Forest, out of cell coverage, I was able to do video calls with work while Mrs. theskinnyonbenny live streamed the Murdaugh murder trial. To say that this technology is a game-changer is a huge understatement.</p><p>But the sailors who just hop back and forth between Ft.

There were at least two things that I'll remember about that island forever, and a funny story to go with them.  Here's a post about sailing in 2021 that isn't all disasters.</description><link>https://theskinnyonbenny.com/blog2/long-island-happy-times</link><pubDate>Wed, 31 May 2023 14:40:00 -0400</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As I mentioned when we last gathered, there are lots of reasons to spend time on Long Island, Bahamas</p><h2>North Part of the Island</h2><p>If you drive the main road all the way up to the northernmost point of the island, you'll get to a monument that recognizes both Christopher Columbus, for landing there first, and the indigenous people who would soon be extinct, due in no small part to European genocide. That's not the fun part, although the views are fantastic.</p><p>Right beside there, there's a really nice spot for a swim, and you can probably have it all to yourself.</p><p>This alone would be worth the trip.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://dynamic.theskinnyonbenny.com/gal/169%20-%20Summer%202021%20Pt%203%20-%20Long%20Island%20and%20Lizards/resIMG_20210704_121545_IMG_2248.jpg" data-lightview-caption="Beach on North Point of Long Island" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://dynamic.theskinnyonbenny.com/gal/169%20-%20Summer%202021%20Pt%203%20-%20Long%20Island%20and%20Lizards/resIMG_20210704_121545_IMG_2248.jpg" alt="https://dynamic.theskinnyonbenny.com/gal/169%20-%20Summer%202021%20Pt%203%20-%20Long%20Island%20and%20Lizards/resIMG_20210704_121545_IMG_2248.jpg"  ><br><span class="caption">Beach on North Point of Long Island</span></a><p>On your way back in, there's a real resort. It's not a must-see destination, but if it would be nice after your swim to sit at a table and be served rum punch, it's there for you.</p><p>The abandoned resort is kind of cool too. There's a boardwalk through a rocky shore that's a nice, nice walk. The abandoned bar will tease you though if you work up a thirst for another rum punch.</p><h2>Cold Beer Lane</h2><p>While driving down a dirt/sand/gravel spur, there was a sign pointing down an even lesser used road that read, "Cold Beer Lane". We're explorers, so of course we took the detour. It lead to a small little restaurant. We walked up, but it was locked up.</p><p>But as we turned to leave, someone opened the door and insisted that we come in. Music turned on, cold beer was served, and we drank beer and traded stories with a couple of locals. The guy serving us was a songwriter, and he set me up with a way to download his music, which is still on my phone. The other guy had a girlfriend in Louisiana who ignored our text messages. If the kids hadn't been bored out of their minds, we might have stayed until nightfall.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://dynamic.theskinnyonbenny.com/gal/169%20-%20Summer%202021%20Pt%203%20-%20Long%20Island%20and%20Lizards/resIMG_20210704_134508_S0463060_JPG.jpg" data-lightview-caption="Down Cold Beer Lane" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://dynamic.theskinnyonbenny.com/gal/169%20-%20Summer%202021%20Pt%203%20-%20Long%20Island%20and%20Lizards/resIMG_20210704_134508_S0463060_JPG.jpg" alt="https://dynamic.theskinnyonbenny.com/gal/169%20-%20Summer%202021%20Pt%203%20-%20Long%20Island%20and%20Lizards/resIMG_20210704_134508_S0463060_JPG.jpg"  ><br><span class="caption">Down Cold Beer Lane</span></a><h2>My Man Earnest</h2><p>Two of my Long Island experiences were so wonderful and unique that I don't have any hope of replicating them.

And it was just us, and a little building with a bar.<br><br>The bartender's name was Earnest. He apparently grew up right there, and he definitely worked on island time. A super nice guy, but it took at least 15 minutes to get a beer, a rum punch, and two cokes. He kept track of our drinks with a pencil and spiral notebook, and his glacial pace made it easy for us to do the math to figure out whether our cash would hold out or not.</p><p>Eventually, a couple of other locals came in for a drink, and he was just as slow for them.<br><br>Here's the kicker: a cruise ship was scheduled to stop on Long Island for the first time a few days later. Earnest had been told to expect around 500 guests.<br><br>Mrs. theskinnyonbenny tried to coach him up: have 100 gallons of rum punch made and ready. Have all of the beers cold and easy to get to. Cash only. Cash, drinks, next. Cash, drinks, next.<br><br>If we didn't have to leave the next day to meet friends in Georgetown (and it turns out, we didn't), we would have stuck around and worked the bar for Earnest.</p><p>But the highlight, of course, is that beach. I haven't seen one prettier, and I might never.</p><h2>Dean's Blue Hole</h2><p>I've saved the best experience for last.<br><br>Dean's Blue Hole is this spot right off the beach where the shallow turquoise water drops straight down, so there's this deep circle of dark blue right in the middle. When we visited, there were teams of free divers practicing.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://dynamic.theskinnyonbenny.com/gal/169%20-%20Summer%202021%20Pt%203%20-%20Long%20Island%20and%20Lizards/resIMG_20210703_100510_S0872132_JPG.jpg" data-lightview-caption="Terrible picture of Dean's Blue Hole" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://dynamic.theskinnyonbenny.com/gal/169%20-%20Summer%202021%20Pt%203%20-%20Long%20Island%20and%20Lizards/resIMG_20210703_100510_S0872132_JPG.jpg" alt="https://dynamic.theskinnyonbenny.com/gal/169%20-%20Summer%202021%20Pt%203%20-%20Long%20Island%20and%20Lizards/resIMG_20210703_100510_S0872132_JPG.jpg"  ><br><span class="caption">Terrible picture of Dean's Blue Hole</span></a><p>I wish I had better pictures of this, but this was the stop where the water camera decided to take on moisture and fog up from the inside, rendering it useless. But let me tell you about what we can all only envision.</p><p>I swam over to the edge of the hole to watch the divers. One dive in particular. The diver took a deep breath and started swimming straight down, kicking with huge flippers on her feet. I watched her get smaller and smaller against the field of dark blue. At some depth, she started to look like CGI. After she was about the size of a grain of rice to my eye, she disappeared into the deep altogether.</p><p>I waited. And waited. And waited. And no diver.</p><p>I looked up at her teammates, resting on a floating platform above it all. They looked totally disinterested.</p><p>I looked back down, and nothing. More nothing. Still nothing.</p><p>I looked up again. It had been minutes. Many minutes, it seemed. Aren't they worried? I didn't come to see someone die down here.</p><p>After another eternity, she appeared as a speck, pushing herself toward the surface with those flippers.</p><p>It's probably the most amazing thing I've ever seen a human being do in person.<br><br><a class="lightview centered" href="https://dynamic.theskinnyonbenny.com/gal/169%20-%20Summer%202021%20Pt%203%20-%20Long%20Island%20and%20Lizards/resIMG_20210702_175509_IMG_2209.jpg" data-lightview-caption="One more just to show that there were also people on this trip." data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://dynamic.theskinnyonbenny.com/gal/169%20-%20Summer%202021%20Pt%203%20-%20Long%20Island%20and%20Lizards/resIMG_20210702_175509_IMG_2209.jpg" alt="https://dynamic.theskinnyonbenny.com/gal/169%20-%20Summer%202021%20Pt%203%20-%20Long%20Island%20and%20Lizards/resIMG_20210702_175509_IMG_2209.jpg"  ><br><span class="caption">One more just to show that there were also people on this trip.</span></a></p><p>You've seen this link before, but <a href="https://dynamic.theskinnyonbenny.com/gal/169" target="_blank">more pics here</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://theskinnyonbenny.com/blog2/dont-worry-about-long-island-robbers</guid><title>Don’t Worry About Long Island Robbers</title><description>We were at Great Exuma that Summer just before Fourth of July weekend.

Not ideal, but it kept the batteries up so that we could get around, navigate, and generally function.</p><p>Until it didn't.</p><p>As engines will do, this one tore up its impeller. I tore the boat apart looking for the spares that I knew I had on board, but I could not find them. I did find a shop in Nassau that had them in stock and who would ship a couple to Georgetown for an extravagant fee.</p><p>The next morning Mrs. thekinnyonbenny and V went to the airport to retrieve our parts, while I tried to keep the only head (toilet) on board in semi-working condition. It's pumps' gaskets were only slightly more reliable than the engine impeller.</p><p>I believe that someone must have bought my parts an actual ticket on the plane, because the cost was up there.

I think it's a tad under 100 miles long, and all of the places to eat and things to see and do are spread up and down the entire length. So renting a car is a necessity.</p><p>The island's car rental place was coincidentally right where we came ashore, and in no time, we had reserved a car for the long weekend. The catch is that like everything else on Long Island, it's cash-only.</p><p>You can see where this is headed.</p><p>On our first full day with the car, we drove to both banks on the island. Both ATMs were out of service. As we drove up and down doing other things, we tried several other ideas -- cash back at the grocery, hardware store, and gas stations was a no. There was a little truck-stop style casino, and you couldn't get cash there either. We drove North to find "the resort", and we found a strange, abandoned resort with cabins from the 70s but where the grass was mowed. No ATM though.</p><p>It started to get stressful. You see, we didn't actually have enough cash left to pay for the rental car.</p><p>In asking around, we were told that at least one beachside bar and grill took Paypal as payment. It is called Tiny's, and I was disappointed to find that it wasn't run by a 6 foot 4, 320 pound Bahamian that everyone called Tiny. It was a nice little place with a good view. Conversation flowed between tourists and locals alike. Best of all, we didn't have to count pennies because of the Paypal thing.</p><p>Mrs. theskinnyonbenny told the host about our predicament and offered a fee for a Paypal cash advance. He declined, so we ordered another drink and resolved ourselves to turn in the car early and head back to Georgetown the next day.</p><p>But then as we were leaving, his wife came out, and made the PayPal cash advance happen. I think that she even declined to take a big fee on it (which was nice, because I bet our bar tab was more than our college era monthly rent).</p><a class="lightview alignright" href="https://dynamic.theskinnyonbenny.com/gal/169%20-%20Summer%202021%20Pt%203%20-%20Long%20Island%20and%20Lizards/resIMG_20210702_191642_IMG_2215.jpg" data-lightview-caption="Hanging out at Tiny's" data-lightview-group="group1" style="width:350px;"><img src="https://dynamic.theskinnyonbenny.com/gal/169%20-%20Summer%202021%20Pt%203%20-%20Long%20Island%20and%20Lizards/resIMG_20210702_191642_IMG_2215.jpg" alt="https://dynamic.theskinnyonbenny.com/gal/169%20-%20Summer%202021%20Pt%203%20-%20Long%20Island%20and%20Lizards/resIMG_20210702_191642_IMG_2215.jpg"><br><span class="caption">Hanging out at Tiny's</span></a><p>And that, my friends, is why you won't be robbed by gunmen in Long Island who want you to take money out of the ATM and hand it over to them.</p><p>It's a good thing that our stay was saved, because there were some absolute highlights of the entire trip, including a couple of things that would have been bucket-list things had I known they existed. This post is getting long, so I'll write up some Long Island highlights for the next.</p><p>One more disaster to recount from these days though before I get into a positive place.</p><p>Long Island was the only place in the Bahamas that had cell towers but where our hotspot did not work. We got there on the last work day of the month, which meant that Mrs. theskinnyonbenny had urgent accounting to be completed. So we dinghyed ashore with backpack-offices in tow to find a restaurant with wifi.</p><p>Meanwhile, our swim platform was down. Also, the motor that brings it up and down was broken -- because of course it was -- so it had a line tied from the swim ladder to a winch so that we could raise and lower it.<br><br>When we returned, it was dark, and Mrs. theskinnyonbenny tripped over that out-of-place line. The laptop bag went right into the drink. It was the 2nd Macbook ruined by seawater in just a few weeks. It joined an ipad and a Kindle reader, along with tens of thousands of dollars worth of boat electronics in the circuit board graveyard that was this trip.</p><p>Happier tales of Long Island next week!</p><p>PS, I wrote about other bits of our star-crossed summer <a href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/blog2/archives/2289">here</a> and <a href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/blog2/archives/2284">here</a>, but there is actually a lot more to tell.

Clinton was around to get some credit for some treaty having to do with this little spat. I could probably be less vague if I read the article that I linked there, but I'm not gonna.</p><p>Anyway, more than one Dubliner heard our hillbilly American accents, and naturally asked if we were in town with the presidential delegation.</p><p>That was annoying, but more annoying was how often the radio played Coolio's Gangsta Paradise. I would guess that no song has ever been that big a hit in Ireland before or since. At first it was funny, as I had no notion as a stupid young American that anyone across the pond had even been exposed to hip-hop. But were they ever exposed.</p><p>This week, I see headlines pop up about the Inflation Reduction Act (which I know even less about than Irish terrorism), and some of the headlines call it the "IRA". IRA was also the name of the Irish terrorist bomber organization, and thus, I'm reminded of our Ireland trip.</p><p>And that, my friends, is why I can't get Gangsta Paradise out of my head this week.</p><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/greenline.gif" class="greenline" alt="{{divider}}" /><p>In some alternate universe, I started music blogging in 2004 instead of writing about asinine things that I had on my mind back then. In that universe, I can was on for hours about the genius of some indy band that no one ever heard of, and I have a show on Sirius XMU that airs at 2:00 AM every Sunday.</p><p>In that universe, I am very poor.</p><p>At one point last year, I decided that I was going to listen to all of <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/best-albums-of-all-time-1062063/marvin-gaye-whats-going-on-4-1063232/">Rolling Stone's top 500 albums of all time</a>, and write up a sentence or two about them. I ended up hating -- and I mean absolutely hating like you hate dead bunny rabbits -- albums number 2 and 3.<br><br>I know it's my own shortcoming. There are artists that I adore who talk about those albums inspiring them to make music. But I made myself listen to them 3 or 4 times each, and it was self-torture.</p><p>Album #4 was Stevie Wonder's <i>Songs in they Key of Life</i> which I loved so much that I abandoned my project before making it 1% of the way in and listened to Stevie's lifetime of work instead. And the first time I listened to <i>Songs in the Key of Life</i> all the way through, I found out that Gangsta Paradise is just Coolio rapping on top of Stevie's Pastime Paradise. So maybe that's really the song stuck in my head.</p><p>I swear, sometimes these posts wrap themselves up without me even having to try. .</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://theskinnyonbenny.com/blog2/pitches</guid><title>Pitches</title><description>I have some great ideas for TV shows that they should make.</description><link>https://theskinnyonbenny.com/blog2/pitches</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 May 2023 10:42:00 -0400</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last night, we watched <i>My Cousin Vinnie</i>. Probably the first time I've seen it since the 90s, and it turns out that the reason it was so popular is that it's good. It's still good. I didn't remember much other than the main plot outline, and it had me laughing.</p><p>Not just the big moments -- like when Vinnie came into court wearing the thrift shop suit, but also ones that could go unnoticed if you're playing on your phone while it's on. In one court scene, the prosecutor mentions "all our little old ancestors bank in England." As he speaks, the camera panning the jury stops for an extra beat on the face of a black lady who could have had a best supporting nomination just for the look on her face during that 1.5 seconds of screen time.</p><p>How about instead of <a href="https://variety.com/2023/tv/news/matlock-reboot-elsbeth-poppas-house-series-cbs-1235607934/" target="_blank">rebooting Matlock</a>, they back the truck full of money to Joe Peci's and Marisa Tomei's houses and have them revise their characters and solve courtroom crimes somewhere else that they don't fit in?</p><p>I have more TV show pitches, y'all.<br><br>Lucky Hank is very similar to an idea I had about a Mad Men style drama set in the English Department of a huge state university. My version would have had a lot more political maneuvering and back-stabbing, and I dare say it would have been funnier. (Topic for another day: the embarrassingly shitty state of academic buildings at LSU.)</p><p>My most flushed out idea is for <i>Neighborhood Pool</i>, an Office-style mockumentary taking place at a neighborhood pool. My ideas are exaggerated stories based on real people and events from the Tara pool in Baton Rouge, and the fact that the pool is named after a slave-owning estate from <i>Gone With the Wind</i> is just the tip of the iceberg, comedy-wise.</p><a class="lightview alignright" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/tarapool1.jpg" data-lightview-caption="Tara pool pics from 2015" data-lightview-group="group1" style="width:350px;"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/tarapool1.jpg" alt="/img/tarapool1.jpg"><br><span class="caption">Tara pool pics from 2015</span></a><p>I'll piss off someone if I get into too many details, but there are sources that I can mine for comedy that are probably universal when it comes to the neighborhood pool experience:</p><ul><li>The board member committed to an overzealous enforcement of the rules.  Especially as it contrasts to our main-cast group of heavy-drinking parents.</li>
<li>Along with that, we have speak-to-the-camera sessions with the kids of the main characters, where they are dismissive of parental involvement and have their own little dramas going on.</li> 
<li>The tanning people, committed to their hobby in spite of the fact that their skin looks like overcooked sausage.</li>
<li>The people who have their own little territory and insist on their own music, so that everyone else hears a mismash of official club music and their tired classic rock playlist.</li>
<li>Lifeguards who continuously blow the pool closed in name of lightning, even though there is no threat of bad weather.</li>
<li>The angsty teen who brings his guitar to the pool to try to catch a lifeguard's attention</li>
<li>Adults who stand in the pool and pound Michelob Ultras all day long, yet never need to use the restroom.</li>
<li>The snack bar speaker, which announces whose orders are ready in unintelligible gibberish.  (Unintelligible Gibberish would be a good name for your cover band or your next boat.)</li>
<li>In my running plot for season 1, the pool parents find out that one of the dads is going to get divorced.  This leads to all of the tanning ladies -- both married and divorced -- to throw themselves at divorcing dad shamelessly.</li></ul><p>If anyone wants to make this when the writers and studios come to terms, I'll be happy to join the writers room. I haven't even been to the pool as a guest in several years, but the comedy tap is still providing.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/tarapool2.jpg" data-lightview-caption="tarapool2.jpg" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/tarapool2.jpg" alt="/img/tarapool2.jpg" width="450px"><br><span class="caption"></span></a>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://theskinnyonbenny.com/blog2/disgusting</guid><title>Disgusting</title><description>Your author discovers his disgust index and has some thoughts on the matter.</description><link>https://theskinnyonbenny.com/blog2/disgusting</link><pubDate>Thu, 4 May 2023 09:47:00 -0400</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I think that I've been a hater of internet polls from the dawn of internet polls, and certainly since the dawn of internet polls that encourage one to share their results to Facebook.</p><p>But that doesn't mean that I'm not secretly engaging with them, ever now and then.</p><p>I very much enjoyed the <a href="https://www.idrlabs.com/food-disgust/test.php" target="_blank">Food Disgust Test</a> that's making it's rounds this week. I assumed that I would score off-the-scale low, as I'll eat foods that most of you would consider garbage.

The only flesh-like kitchen thing that nauseates me a little is cutting apart a whole chicken.</p><p>The feel of popping the thighs and the wings out of their joint so that the knife will slide cleanly between the ball and the socket has such a satisfying feel in the fingers, while also making me gag almost every time.</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9FHHmx6kDGc" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe><p><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/greenline.gif" class="greenline" alt="{{divider}}" /></p><p>I boiled crawfish a couple of times this Spring, and I wasn't ever thrilled with the results. I boiled for the third time this past weekend, and it turns out that not all of the packages of crab boil are created equally. Zatarain's Pro Boil made for a much better batch of crawfish. That, plus a 45-minute soak rather than the 20 minutes that the packaging suggests.</p><p>(I write this here so that I can remember the next time that I boil, two years from now.)</p><p>My most succesful boil was at the first annual crawfish cookoff in support of <a herf="https://www.redstickcares.org" target="_blank">Red Stick C.A.R.E.S.</a>. The 45-minute soak time was a combination of two things. First, I had the start time wrong in my head and geared up to have them ready an hour earlier than I was supposed to. And second, when I meant to pull them out, it was pouring rain, so I decided to let them soak some more.</p><p>The turnout was good. I can't imagine how good it would have been with the beautiful weather that we've had the rest of this week. They got BR Music Studio to line up some of their student bands, and those kids were pretty good. They also brought a whole lot of people that sat there and didn't buy tickets to eat crawfish.</p><p>I don't know what sort of space aliens can sit there smelling crawfish all day and not pony up $20 for an all-you-can-eat wrist band. Maybe they're all super high on the food disgust chart.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/carescrawfish1.jpg" data-lightview-caption="What a team!" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/carescrawfish1.jpg" alt="/img/carescrawfish1.jpg"  ><br><span class="caption">What a team!</span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/carescrawfish2.jpg" data-lightview-caption="During the rain delay" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/carescrawfish2.jpg" alt="/img/carescrawfish2.jpg"  ><br><span class="caption">During the rain delay</span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/carescrawfish3.jpg" data-lightview-caption="Good turnout" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/carescrawfish3.jpg" alt="/img/carescrawfish3.jpg"  ><br><span class="caption">Good turnout</span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/carescrawfish4.jpg" data-lightview-caption="I wish I had gotten a better picture of V in his crawfish costume." data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/carescrawfish4.jpg" alt="/img/carescrawfish4.jpg"  ><br><span class="caption">I wish I had gotten a better picture of V in his crawfish costume.</span></a>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://theskinnyonbenny.com/blog2/europe-trip-part-1</guid><title>Europe Trip Part 1</title><description>I couldn't even find Slovenia on a map before I went there.

She's very close to being in a state as close to full repair as is possible, afer suffering an electrical surge just about a year ago. V and I motor-sailed her back to her home dock, and for the first time in a while, I really enjoyed being out on the water.</p><p>Meanwhile, we dream of new boats. On top of the disrepair, we'd really like another cabin and another head. We even went to the boat show in Annapolis back in October to see what features and designs the manufacturers are trotting out there now.</p><p>We saw some cool boats. A couple of French manufacturers are turning out 45 ft aluminum hull sailboats with centerboards that make them draw just a foot or two. Bali catamarans have a garage-door rear wall, so the whole thing can open up and put the main saloon in open-air (at the cost of having a tiny mainsail, and oh my god when that thing starts to leak. That's how I think about boat features now).</p><p>Mrs. theskinnyonbenny also found an <a href="https://pegasus-yachts.com/" target="_blank">intriguing boat</a> online that wasn't at the show. We wathced the video tour and talked to one of the owners about some questions that we had. That turned into an invite to spend a few days aboard one of their boats followed by a visit to their factory in Slovenia. That sounded fun, and we've been wanting to do a little touring in Eurpoe, so one day after school let out, we were on a plane.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://dynamic.theskinnyonbenny.com/gal/176%20-%20Eurpoe%202022%20pt%201%20-%20Slovenia%20Croatia%20Montenegro/resIMG_20220522_203305_IMG_7983_HEIC.jpg" data-lightview-caption="Pegasus 50 Hull #1" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://dynamic.theskinnyonbenny.com/gal/176%20-%20Eurpoe%202022%20pt%201%20-%20Slovenia%20Croatia%20Montenegro/resIMG_20220522_203305_IMG_7983_HEIC.jpg" alt="https://dynamic.theskinnyonbenny.com/gal/176%20-%20Eurpoe%202022%20pt%201%20-%20Slovenia%20Croatia%20Montenegro/resIMG_20220522_203305_IMG_7983_HEIC.jpg" width="650px"><br><span class="caption">Pegasus 50 Hull #1</span></a><p>(These, and many many more pictures are <a href="https://dynamic.theskinnyonbenny.com/gal/176" target="_blank">posted here</a>.</p><p>After three planes and a train from Venice to Triste (Italy), a car was supposed to meet us to bring us the rest of the way to Izola, Slovenia. It didn't show. We "wasted" some time in a sleepy Italian town, drinking a couple of beers and watching music videos before the bartender helped us find a cab that would take a credit card (as we had not gotten any Euro-cash yet. I'm pretty sure they all call it Euro-cash.)</p><p>We got let off at the marina in Izola, and still had to hike for what felt like three hours to circle around the boats and find the vessel where we were supposed to stay. They had it open, nice and clean, and a chilled local wine and some farmer's market fruit at the ready for us. Two of the owners of the company came by an hour or so later, and we had a good time swapping sailing stories and talking boats, despite how tired we were.</p><p>By then, it was getting on toward 9:00 PM on Sunday night, and finding an open restaurant proved to be a challenge. We wandered into a bar full of guys who didn't speak English and took a little while to figure out that there was no food there. But one of the guys was super nice, and he walked us out of the building and pointed us to the only nearby local restaurant. Dinner and drinks were great, and we got our first sign that prices in Slovenia are great.</p><p>The next two days, we put the boat through its paces. She sailed great -- having a correctly-shaped mainsail with full battens really helps I think (Velvet Elvis has a main that furls into the mast. It's convenient, but the poor sail shape has lead most of the boat-makers to abandon the design.) We had a lot of light wind, and she still moved. It's probably a better boat test -- in 17 kts, they're all going to move pretty well.</p><p>The Northern Adriatic is beautiful. It has deep blue water, and the ocean is rimmed by rolling hills. The Slovenia coast line is small enough that we were able to lay eyes on both Italy and Croatia in a couple of short day sails.</p><p>Exploring Izola was fun too. It's a small seaside down, wrapping around a huge marina. Streets are clean and full of flowers, and the town is full of young people and families. Although it was our Summer, their kids were still in school, so there was a definite rhythm to the days. We mostly sat at outdoor cafes, and we kept the boat stocked with wines, fruit and cheese.<br><br>At lunch one day, the waiter came by after a long wait, and V wasn't ready to order.<br><br>"What the heck?" asked his mother.</p><p>"I was staring at the wall," he replied.</p><p>"Huh?"</p><p>"It's a really nice wall."</p><p>I turned, and indeed, it was a nice wall.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://dynamic.theskinnyonbenny.com/gal/176%20-%20Eurpoe%202022%20pt%201%20-%20Slovenia%20Croatia%20Montenegro/resIMG_20220523_152653_IMG_8002_HEIC.jpg" data-lightview-caption="A nice wall" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://dynamic.theskinnyonbenny.com/gal/176%20-%20Eurpoe%202022%20pt%201%20-%20Slovenia%20Croatia%20Montenegro/resIMG_20220523_152653_IMG_8002_HEIC.jpg" alt="https://dynamic.theskinnyonbenny.com/gal/176%20-%20Eurpoe%202022%20pt%201%20-%20Slovenia%20Croatia%20Montenegro/resIMG_20220523_152653_IMG_8002_HEIC.jpg" width="650px"><br><span class="caption">A nice wall</span></a><p>After some sailing days, we took the bus to Ljubljana so that we could tour the factory where the boats get made. Like all bus routes everywhere, it took a roundabout way through rural towns. It was really pretty, but took an hour longer than it should have. We were shown great hospitality by our hosts, and examining the boats in various stages of construction was pretty cool. They brought us to a local place that served us all kinds of game (bear, goat duck) prepared deliciously, along with lots of local wines. I think we spent at least a couple of hours as course after course of meats came out.</p><p>Our planned bus out of town was full, so we ended up wandering around downtown Ljubljana. I'm so glad we did. It's an energetic, lively place with lots of beautiful buildings and a river running through it, which is always a nice touch.</p><p>After a night in Ljubljana, we decided to rent a car and move on to being tourists in Croatia.<br><br>The drive to Dubrovnik took most of the rest of the day. An interesting thing is that you drive a long way through Croatia, then have to pass through Bosnia and Herzegovina, and then back into Croatia again. These countries aren't part of the Schengen treaty, which is the one that lets you pass country to country without having to do the whole border crossing dance. So that day, we had to border cross into Croatia, border cross into Bosnia and Herzegovina, and then border cross back into Croatia. That significantly increases the travel time.</p><p>We got to the gates of Old Dubrovnik just before sunset. Old Dubrovnik is the walled city with narrow alleys between blocks of buildings. It's the part of town that's thousands of years old. I appreciate that the streets are marble stone. I'll go out on a limb and declare that t's impossible for your city to look like a shit hole when you have marble streets.</p><p>We spent a few days there, doing the tourist things -- wandering around and drinking wine, mostly. The tour of the city from the walls that loom up above is exhausting but worth the effort. It rewards you with views of the town and views out over the blue, blue sea.<br><br><a class="lightview centered" href="https://dynamic.theskinnyonbenny.com/gal/176%20-%20Eurpoe%202022%20pt%201%20-%20Slovenia%20Croatia%20Montenegro/resIMG_20220527_172626_IMG_8102_JPG.jpg" data-lightview-caption="Paddling Dubrovnik" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://dynamic.theskinnyonbenny.com/gal/176%20-%20Eurpoe%202022%20pt%201%20-%20Slovenia%20Croatia%20Montenegro/resIMG_20220527_172626_IMG_8102_JPG.jpg" alt="https://dynamic.theskinnyonbenny.com/gal/176%20-%20Eurpoe%202022%20pt%201%20-%20Slovenia%20Croatia%20Montenegro/resIMG_20220527_172626_IMG_8102_JPG.jpg" width="650px"><br><span class="caption">Paddling Dubrovnik</span></a></p><p>Just over a couple of large hills from Dubrovnik is another border crossing -- this one into Montenegro. We booked a room over a weekend in another walled, ancient city -- this one Kotor.</p><p>We spent a weekend in Kotor, which to me, is like a rock-and-roll version of Dubrovnik. It's less crowded, less gleaming, and less touristy, but it was still a really cool place to visit. One thing that stands out is the massive number of stray cats. It's really the only place we visited with lots of stray animals. The cats added some personality to the place. We didn't see any that looked mangy or unhealthy.<br><br><a class="lightview centered" href="https://dynamic.theskinnyonbenny.com/gal/176%20-%20Eurpoe%202022%20pt%201%20-%20Slovenia%20Croatia%20Montenegro/resIMG_20220528_174637_IMG_8186_HEIC.jpg" data-lightview-caption="The kids play in Kotor" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://dynamic.theskinnyonbenny.com/gal/176%20-%20Eurpoe%202022%20pt%201%20-%20Slovenia%20Croatia%20Montenegro/resIMG_20220528_174637_IMG_8186_HEIC.jpg" alt="https://dynamic.theskinnyonbenny.com/gal/176%20-%20Eurpoe%202022%20pt%201%20-%20Slovenia%20Croatia%20Montenegro/resIMG_20220528_174637_IMG_8186_HEIC.jpg" width="650px"><br><span class="caption">The kids play in Kotor</span></a></p><p>Take a look at <a href="https://dynamic.theskinnyonbenny.com/gal/176" target="_blank">all the pictures</a> I've posted for this leg of the trip</a>.

Before we left, lightnight fried our boat's electronics.  The generator didn't make it to Key West.  And we lost tons of consumer electronics to Neptune as well.  We managed to have some fun though.  This is how the trip started.</description><link>https://theskinnyonbenny.com/blog2/summer-2021-how-we-made-a-weeklong-trip-take-half-the-summer</link><pubDate>Tue, 8 Mar 2022 10:05:00 -0500</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For a week, I've been laughing at the size of John Lennon's butt crack.</p><p>I mean, that's a ridiculously long biological feature.</p><a class="lightview alignright" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/john-lennon.jpg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1" style="width:350px;"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/john-lennon.jpg" alt="/img/john-lennon.jpg"><br><span class="caption"></span></a><p>And speaking of ridiculously long features, let me tell you about how long it took us to get to the Bahamas last Summer.</p><p>We planned to leave almost as soon as school was out. We got a lot of gear stored the weekend before, and then we did a final load of gear and provisions the day before we were set to leave. I was to get up at first light and head out.</p><p>The weather was a long way from ideal. It was blowing 25 knots, straight from the direction we would be trying to travel. In fact, it had pushed so much water from the Gulf up into Lake Pontchartrain that we had to wade out to the boat in water that fluctated between shin-deep and waist-deep while walking on the deck out to the boat.</p><p>On our departure date, I started the motor, got the lines off of the dock, and started to back off. As soon as the dock was out of reach, the motor died. I tried a few times to restart it, and then I screamed for help.</p><p>That monster wind was blowing us backwards, straight down the canal, and we were getting faster and faster. A crash into someone else's dock was imminent. Mrs. theskinnyonbenny called for the anchor (which was brilliant), and we got it down in time to stop our inevitable wreck.</p><p>I still couldn't get the motor to restart, so we hit #1 on boat speed-dial, Sea Tow. They sent a guy who was helpful, but he didn't think that with the wind gusts, he could move us around safely. We sent him on his way.</p><p>I spent some time troubleshooting and found that the deisel didn't smell like deisel. We had a ton of water in there. I won't get too technical, but there's a fuel/water separator in there. I spent an hour or so pumping fuel in there, skimming the water, and repeating until we were seeing actual deisel in there. After that, the motor started right up.</p><p>Afteer that, we decided to wait for a little bit better weather to shove off again. Two days later, we took off without incident.</p><p>On our first day out, the wind was better, but still pretty string, and still right on our bow. Once we got to Mississippi, we stayed inside the barrier islands, but we were still crashing into waves steadily under motor all day. The wind and waves settled down as it started to get dark, and that's when we noticed another problem.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://dynamic.theskinnyonbenny.com/gal/171%20-%20Summer%202021%20Pt%201%20-%20Getting%20to%20the%20Exumas/resIMG_20210522_155053_IMG_1801.jpg" data-lightview-caption="On Mississippi Sound" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://dynamic.theskinnyonbenny.com/gal/171%20-%20Summer%202021%20Pt%201%20-%20Getting%20to%20the%20Exumas/resIMG_20210522_155053_IMG_1801.jpg" alt="https://dynamic.theskinnyonbenny.com/gal/171%20-%20Summer%202021%20Pt%201%20-%20Getting%20to%20the%20Exumas/resIMG_20210522_155053_IMG_1801.jpg"  ><br><span class="caption">On Mississippi Sound</span></a><p>Our AIS (a dandy little piece of electronics that draws the position of other boats while we're out underway) had been giving us problems. Other boats were seeing us on their screens, but our screen didn't show any of them. I turned on the radar so that they would show up as purple blobs, at least, and it wasn't working either. We also had one light out. That's a whole lot of the things we have on board to make sure we don't bump into big giant ships in the middle of the night.</p><p>A nighttime passage across the Mobile Bay shipping channel is stressful enough under normal circumstances. From a distance, it's hard to tell a rig from a ship. At about 2:00 AM, I was thinking, "They shouldn't be allowed to put a red light on a rig like that. People will think it's the port side of a ship," and just then, the "rig" radioed me to to ask me to pass to his stern as he entered the Bay from the Gulf. Oops.</p><p>One night of that was enough, so we put in to Pensacola for repairs. I found a super-competent guy who was able to get a new AIS and a new radar shipped overnight, and got them installed. But as he worked, other electronic components started dying. He diagnosed a lightning strike, and told us that stuff would be failing one by one all Summer long. It was a dark time.</p><p>Memorial Day weekend was on us, so we went to a nice little anchorage near the mouth of Pensacola Bay. We had anchored there a time or two before, and usually shared it with a few other boats, some fishemen, and a dolphin or two. On Memorial Day weekend, it was boat tied to boat tied to boat from one shore to the other. Take a meth lab, the shittest modern country music artist, a beach resort, and roll it into one, then multiply that by a thousand. That's what was there.</p><p>We went up the sound towards Orange Beach, maybe a mile or so, and we had nice spots to kayak, swim, and dinghy for the weekend. A couple of dolphiins popped up near our dinghy, and Rosie decided, "fuck it, I'm chasing them" and dove into the water swimming for her water-bound playmates. We found a pretty good taco truck one night. It was a decent weekend.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://dynamic.theskinnyonbenny.com/gal/171%20-%20Summer%202021%20Pt%201%20-%20Getting%20to%20the%20Exumas/resIMG_20210530_150250_IMG_6772.jpg" data-lightview-caption="Memorial Day Weekend - Dinner on the hook" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://dynamic.theskinnyonbenny.com/gal/171%20-%20Summer%202021%20Pt%201%20-%20Getting%20to%20the%20Exumas/resIMG_20210530_150250_IMG_6772.jpg" alt="https://dynamic.theskinnyonbenny.com/gal/171%20-%20Summer%202021%20Pt%201%20-%20Getting%20to%20the%20Exumas/resIMG_20210530_150250_IMG_6772.jpg"  ><br><span class="caption">Memorial Day Weekend - Dinner on the hook</span></a><p>After that, the electronics guys were tearing apart our boat to replace things for a week. The cat and I stayed on board, while the rest of the family took a rental car and headed home. Liveaboard life by oneself on a boat where all of the panels are pulled off isn't fun. I had a bike and a dinghy to use for food runs, but not much close. I pretty well wiped out our summer's supply of hot dogs. It was a week of hot dogs, watching baseball on an ipad, and getting a lot of work done.<br><br>We finally got out of Pensacola June 11. Most of our stuff was working, but we were prepared for stuff to be failing. The plug for shore power air conditioning hadn't been replaced and was unusable, but we don't spend that much time in a marina anyway. The sail to Key West was more or less uneventful, and once there, we resupplied, visited some of our favorite hangouts, and tried to avoid the Covid-laden crowds.</p><p>Speaking of Covid, we had to get V a test to get in to the Bahamas. Mrs. theskinnyonbenny and I were vaccinated and K was under the age where they care. A very nice medical professional came out to our boat, stuck the swab up his nose, and disappeared. Results to follow by email. We rolled the dice and headed out. While still in sight of Key West, a monster squall blew through and tossed us all over the place for an hour or so. That was no fun.</p><p>The rest of the passage was fine. A couple of days and nights later, we were close enough to some Bahamian islands to unbox our hotspot and check the internet. The hotspot was an ancient piece of equipment whose screen showed something like 3TB of use up to that point. It was working okay, but if you put down your device to do something else for a bit, you had to power the hotspot off and back on for it to connect again. Not ideal.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://dynamic.theskinnyonbenny.com/gal/171%20-%20Summer%202021%20Pt%201%20-%20Getting%20to%20the%20Exumas/resIMG_20210615_172358_IMG_6794.jpg" data-lightview-caption="Resupply run in Key West.

This is my favorite pic from the trip.</span></a><p>Somewhere in here, I also had an incident where a stream of salt water spray came right through a hatch in calm seas, landing right on my computer keyboard. The computer was toast.</p><p>On June 18, we pulled in to a marina in Nassau to clear in. We had V's covid clearance, and all of the paperwork was fine. I decided to fill the water tanks while the rest of the family moved booze and gear to a charter boat that our friends would be picking up later that same evening. The waater ran and ran and ran. It was taking forever. I blamed Bahamian water pressure, but still, it had only been a few days since we filled up in Key West. After forever, I pulled up some floor boards and saw that the water was running from our aft tank straight into the bilge. We were just filling fresh water and just as fast, the bilge pump was pumping it overboard. For the rest of the trip, a high water alarm would occasionally go off because of leaking water from that tank (later identified as a host to be replaced). The alarm shrieked an ungodly, inescapable scream, which is good for a high water alarm on a boat, but still....</p><p>After a full day sail to Highborne Cay, I tried moving the SIM card from the Bahamas hotspot to a different hotspot that we keep on board. Didn't work. I moved it back to the ancient hotspot and now it didn't work either. Without data, we were going to be pretty screwed. We went to bed frustrated, and pretty much assuming that our summer trip was entirely fucked.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://dynamic.theskinnyonbenny.com/gal/171%20-%20Summer%202021%20Pt%201%20-%20Getting%20to%20the%20Exumas/resIMG_20210618_201634_IMG_2024.jpg" data-lightview-caption="Finally there." data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://dynamic.theskinnyonbenny.com/gal/171%20-%20Summer%202021%20Pt%201%20-%20Getting%20to%20the%20Exumas/resIMG_20210618_201634_IMG_2024.jpg" alt="https://dynamic.theskinnyonbenny.com/gal/171%20-%20Summer%202021%20Pt%201%20-%20Getting%20to%20the%20Exumas/resIMG_20210618_201634_IMG_2024.jpg"  ><br><span class="caption">Finally there.</span></a><p>I woke early the next morning and made a last ditch effort with the SIM card. I had forgotten about my work hotspot that I keep in my computer bag. What do you know, it worked! Summer was unfucked!</p><p>This gave us a chance to appreciate that we were in clear blue water, under sunny skies with a cool breeze. There were starfish, rays, and an island bar (where they were kind of rude and super expensive, but on this trip, we weren't going to get it all. In fact, this starts a stretch of summer that was only maybe 20% bad.

But I've been trying to write a little bit every week, because it's fun for me. I end up in this weird place where I tell myself, "I can't post about Y because I haven't even gotten around to writing about X, and it ends up where I don't post at all." That's as dumb as you're thinking it is, so I'm just going to start posting some things here and there. It won't chronicle life sequentially, but who cares?</p><p>This Summer, we sailed again to the Bahamas. While we were there, we enjoyed beautiful days, floating above crystal clear water, with cool breezes perfect for sailing and ventilation blowing night and day. But as good as the good stuff was, we'll also remember all of the fiascos. I'll probably circle back and try to detail the broken boat equipment, salt-ruined electronics, and travel snafus, but it will be more fun to document other people's misfortune first.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/IMG_20210626_164008_IMG_6862.jpg" data-lightview-caption="Hard not to miss the Bahamas when you go through the pictures." data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/IMG_20210626_164008_IMG_6862.jpg" alt="/img/IMG_20210626_164008_IMG_6862.jpg"  ><br><span class="caption">Hard not to miss the Bahamas when you go through the pictures.</span></a><p>Our friends Crystal and Robert were due to meet us in mid-July, right before we turned toward home. The morning they were supposed to fly out, I got a call while still in bed. Robert had been denied travel, because he ordered a "passport card" instead of a passport. It's a little cheaper, and as far as I can tell, it will get you on a cruise ship, but that's about it. I really don't know why they offer such a thing. It must cause problems all the time.</p><p>They were ready to cancel, but after spending all day looking for a new plan, we found a ferry from Fort Lauderdale that could get them in. (The cards are good for boats.) So they drove all night to Fort Lauderdale and were on the boat the next morning.</p><p>They arrived in Bimini, went to clear in to the country, and they were turned away. It turns out that Crystal wasn't in a place yet where she trusted the vaccine that has been in the works for 20 years, and her negative Covid test was about 5 minutes older than Bahamian customs would allow. Back on the ferry they went, for the return cruise to Florida.</p><p>But all was not lost. Robert knew someone who knew someone who worked for a US Congressman, and this samaritan got him an appointment at the Miami passport office. So they booked new plane tickets, scheduled a new Covid test, and started the next morning at their appointment.</p><p>It turns out that the appointment was just an appointment to stand in line. For five and a half hours. If I remember correctly, you can't even bring your phone into a federal building, so they stood in line for all of those hours with nothing to entertain them other than the back of the head for the person in front of them.</p><p>On day four of their week-long vacation, they finally boarded the plane that would get them to the Bahamas.</p><p>I'm tempted to describe the days we had as packed. We did force activities into every daylight moment and plenty of the nights as well. But at least a few of those days looked like this.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/IMG_20210717_134041_S0354044_JPG.jpg" data-lightview-caption="A lot of this." data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/IMG_20210717_134041_S0354044_JPG.jpg" alt="/img/IMG_20210717_134041_S0354044_JPG.jpg"  ><br><span class="caption">A lot of this.</span></a><p>We swam with the famous pigs, and I don't remember from our previous trips that they just shit constantly. These are some really photogenic pigs, but people go through great pains to get photos that don't include pig excrement of some variety or other. The fastest I moved the entire summer was a mad scramble, 10 yards away from a pig's behind, to jump into the dinghy and get away from a floating cloud of nastiness.</p><p>We had the grotto to ourselves, free of big boats full of tourists, which was amazing. We took side trips to Little Farmer's Cay and to Black Point, which was late in the day, and where I believe at least one of us was too drunk to remember. No shame there -- we came to play.</p><p>Vanya took up some time during the week getting himself invited to visit and eat with people on big giant yachts. One night, he had free lobster curry on board, while we ate $18 hambergers 50 yards away inside the yacht club.</p><p>They ended up being able to extend their trip by a couple of days, so all we really missed out on was rest. But there's plenty of time left for that when we're dead. Or when you have a 13 hour drive back home from Fort Lauderdale to end your vacation.</p><p>After we returned, Crystal's mom made a suggestion that I ran with as soon as I heard it. We now have this trophy to pass back and forth after each time we meet up, assuming someone does something dumb enough to deserve it. (Someone always does something dumb enough to deserve it.)<br><br><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/donkey1.png" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/donkey1.png" alt="/img/donkey1.png"  ><br><span class="caption"></span></a></p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/donkey2.png" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/donkey2.png" alt="/img/donkey2.png"  ><br><span class="caption"></span></a>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://theskinnyonbenny.com/blog2/about-this-cat</guid><title>About This Cat</title><description>We went on a Covid-summer road trip that took us the whole Summer.

The writing was on the wall for the shitshow that Florida would become. And the first hurricane of the year spun up between here and Mexico. A long sailing trip wasn't in the cards.</p><p>We had done some early planning of a road trip across the Alaskan Highway, but in ignorance about its own name, the highway crosses Canada, who was equally inhospitable.</p><p>We bought the coolest little camping trailer and headed to the nearest mountains (Arkansas, it turns out). I had planned to be diligent about blooging our travels, but a mishap at the end of our first week left me not in the mood to write.</p><p>Some people put catsup on their eggs. Some people remove their shirts to poop. We took a cat on a cross country camping trip.</p><a class="lightview alignright" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/IMG_6403.jpeg" data-lightview-caption="Maks watches another camper pitch his tent at one of the early stops on our trip." data-lightview-group="group1" style="width:350px;"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/maks-camping-1.jpg" alt="/img/IMG_6403.jpeg" width="350px"><br><span class="caption">Maks watches another camper pitch his tent at one of the early stops on our trip.</span></a><p>Here's my defence: Maks isn't a normal cat. He's mostly like a dog. He (often) comes when you call, he doesn't wander off on a male cat quest to get laid, and he's pretty damned loyal to the refilling of his food bowl. He likes strangers just fine, and likes his family quite a lot. Sometimes, he even comes along when I walk the dog, trotting unleashed beside us.</p><p>For the first three or four stops, it played out like I had expected. Maks might disappear into the woods for a bit, but then he'd come back and hang with us. At night, he joined us in the camper. He was never out of sight for more than an hour or two.</p><p>Then, at a pretty little camp site by the White River in Northern Arkansas, he failed to return. We waited several hours, and then several days. We walked around calling him incessantly. We offered campground kids lucrative rewards. The whole campground was on lookout.</p><p>After a week, it was hard to imagine any scenario other than him slipping into the luggage compartment in the belly of an RV that was on its way out. We waited for the phone call from some nearby town, or Tennessee, or Vermont. Who knows? We left Arkansas and worked our way West without a word. I'll write about so many of the places we visited, but for the purpose of this post, just know that we saw places that I've heard about my whole life, along with several spots that I should have heard about, also along with a few great camping spots that I think people are keeping secret on purpose. All of this an no phone call.</p><a class="lightview alignright" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/maks-camping-2.jpg" data-lightview-caption="In the back seat, you find room where you can on the last leg home." data-lightview-group="group1" style="width:350px;"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/maks-camping-2.jpg" alt="/img/maks-camping-2.jpg" width="350px"><br><span class="caption">In the back seat, you find room where you can on the last leg home.</span></a><p>Until a day, five or six weeks later. We were in a desert in South-Central California. The phone rang, and Maks was hanging around in the campground where we had last seen him. At that point, we were closer to the moon than we were to Arkansas, but we started the longest, hottest, most boring drive that you can devise across these United States. It's a blur of red dirt and scrub brush, and not one of those Bugs Bunny cacti with the two upward pointed arms. We stopped twice to sleep, but both stops were short. I'll turn 50 next year without having seen the Grand Canyon.</p><p>(Now that I think about it, I did see it from the window of a flight in to Vegas once. Does that count?)</p><p>Some nice people met us in a small town WalMart parking lot, and just as suddenly as he had disappeard, Maks was home. He had to have been so surprised to come out of the carrier and find himself face to face with the people he had probably written off as lost. Rosie gave him the excited dog reunion greeting that dog owners get when they get home from work every day. Ko's level of excitement excited me. Vanya's lack of excitement surprised me, but he explained that he never thought that Maks <i>wouldn't</i> be back, so it was just an expected part of the trip to him.</p><p>Maks has settled back into his normal routine, which is pretty much just walking around meowing at people to feed him or pet him. He keeps close enough to see or hear someone in the family. One morning this week, he joined the dog and me on our morning walk.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://theskinnyonbenny.com/blog2/quarantine-year-one</guid><title>Quarantine, Year One</title><description>I never really understood how a change of scenery keeps my work from being oh-so-boring.

I'm way behind some of you on the binge watching, but when I start, I'm just not finding anything I want to stick with. I'm only about 90 minutes into Tiger King, and to be honest, that's probably it for me.</p><p>This morning, I made this list of mealtime rules to be in effect until the end of quarantine.</p><b>Breakfast</b><ul>
<li>If you're heating up a bagel or making toast, knock yourself out.</li>

<li>As soon as your breakfast involves turning on the burner to an oven (eggs, bacon, or pancakes), make an offer to the rest of the house, and if they want some, make more.</li>
</ul><b>Lunch</b><ul>
<li>During the quarantine, there is no such thing as lunch.  If you get hungry after breakfast and before dinner, make a sandwich or snack of some sort.  Mom and I are working, and we're not gonna scrutinize your nutrition during the day.</li>

<li>If there is leftover dinner from yesterday, you may not complain about not having anything to eat.  This applies, no matter how distasteful you find the leftovers to be.</li>
</ul><b>Dinner</b><ul>
	<li>After a day at my desk followed by cooking for you, the last thing I want is for you to pop up from 6 straight hours of video games to tell me the food is gross.  We're eating pretty damn well for people who aren't going to the store every day.  Make a plate and take a taste of everything.  If you don't eat it, it will be there for lunch tomorrow.

I've probably mentioned it somewhere in these pages, but it's a fun day every year. Our house is somewhere very near mile 23, and we pull out the lawn furniture and turn up some music and spend the morning watching the fit people pass. Our neighbors have come to join us for the only morning of the year where we have no traffic.</p><p>The later in the race you get, the more social the racers, so towards the end, we end up sharing beer and champagne. This year. we made a couple of pitchers of banana daiquiris which were popular with the athletes.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/IMG_6403.jpeg" data-lightview-caption="Line that was supposed to hold my fat ass." data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/IMG_6403.jpeg" alt="/img/IMG_6403.jpeg" width="650px"><br><span class="caption">Line that was supposed to hold my fat ass.</span></a><p>One lady asked for a beer when we had no more with us at the street. I jogged inside to grab one from the fridge for her. When I brought it out to her, I breathed heavy, "I'm so tired. I ran all that way."<br><br>She had about 0.25 seconds of sympathetic face before it dawned on her and she came back around to "Shut UP!"</p><p>I've got a good pic of the dog watching the parade that belongs in this post, but it was already a little bit too photo-crowded. Take a look at it as a <a href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/dailyphoto/%3Fyear=2020&month=1&day=29">daily photo</a>.</p><p>Saturday the next weekend, we went to Velvet Elvis to try to resolve a lingering rigging issue. I was all strapped in and ready to be pulled to the top of the mast, when I felt a pop. My weight went back to my feet which were back on deck. A few seconds later, the halyard I was going up on floated down onto my head. No joke here. Fortunately, the line broke while I was an inch off the ground. A few minutes later, I would have been falling from the height of a two-story building. Pshew!</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/IMG_6404.jpeg" data-lightview-caption="LSU Natatorium" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/IMG_6404.jpeg" alt="/img/IMG_6404.jpeg" width="650px"><br><span class="caption">LSU Natatorium</span></a><p>Sunday was a swim meet. V swam in the early session, and K in the afternoon, which meant that I was in the nautitorium for about 7 or 8 hours, when you figure in warm-ups etc. I didn't see a soul that I knew there. I managed to listen to some decent tunes, and read a little bit of a decent book, but mostly, it was watching kids swim.</p><p>The morning session warmups included about 300 kids by my rough calculation. Each of three pools was full to kid-density that you see here. (There's one more pool to my left, and another one under the diving boards at the other end.) Then, there were two shifts, each as crowded as the other. That's a lot of swimming kids.</p><p>While waiting for K's second race. he flipped through my phone pics, and found this one. Apparently, we released a genie on New Year's Eve.<br><br>There's no image processing going on here. It's just a smoke bomb going off under the blue-tinted light over the bar.

I've managed a few, but there's an almost constant clomp of kids mvoing in and out. Practice times are staggered between the different groups of kids. and it takes a while between the time I get there and the time when things calm down.<br><br><a class="lightview alignright" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/waitingatswim.jpg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/waitingatswim.jpg" alt="/img/waitingatswim.jpg" width="270px"><br><span class="caption">This is where I blog now.</span></a></p><p>There are daily reunions of kids that go to different schools, all with news to share. There's the steady vibration dropping bags, pulling off shoes, kicking shoes back on to wet feet. On dry workout days, there are more interludes for hurried stripping of outerwear and then rushing back to swim lanes. It's even hard to sit and read, much less try to fall asleep.</p><p>Audiobooks work okay, but what I really like to do is to make up names and stories about the kids and parents that I see coming and going. And if I'm really being honest, I'm not creative enough to make up stories -- I just mentally file them into the tropes from John Hughs movies.</p><p>There's one young kid, waiting for an even younger sister, who is never without his small, purple LSU football. I want to ask him to throw it around, but he's been taught not to talk to strangers, and I'm too worried about seeming like a weirdo, so we both just sit, bored and quiet.</p><p>By 5:45 or so, eveyone who is swimming is usually at their practice, leaving four or five parents plus a couple of siblings spread out in the bleachers. You can start to hear the echoey pop music playing through the natatorium speakers, probabbly from one of the coach's phones. I wonder if I could catch a quick nap.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://theskinnyonbenny.com/blog2/how-to-championship</guid><title>How to Championship</title><description>Every time that one of my teams plays for a championship -- an experience that I may or may not ever have again -- I get better at how to do it.  Here are my championship stories and how I get better at it every year.</description><link>https://theskinnyonbenny.com/blog2/how-to-championship</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 Jan 2020 17:48:00 -0500</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I think I've got it figured out, y'all.<br><br>I've seen the LSU Tigers play for 3 Natties* now, and I've done everything wrong and everything right that there is to do. And I'm here to share my wisdom.</p><p>*(I hear some of you saying that LSU played for a title after the 2011 season too. I remember the SEC title game that year, but I don't believe they played again after that.)</p><p>After the 2003 season, a friend of ours went out and bought a brand-new huge-ass TV. Unfortunately, he didn't bother to upgrade his cable plan to include the HD channels, and I didn't think that anyone was still watching low-def football. So I only got to see a giant blurry representation of the game. That's lesson number one. Make sure you know where you're watching.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/championship-night-early.jpg" data-lightview-caption="Ready for the game to start on Monday night." data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/championship-night-early.jpg" alt="/img/championship-night-early.jpg"  ><br><span class="caption">Ready for the game to start on Monday night.</span></a><p>For the championship after the 2007 season, we went down to New Orleans to be in the mix. Not to go to the game -- just to be near the game. V was just a tiny little toddler, and we navigated the French Quarter with him on my shoulders.<br><br>After an hour or so, we were headed into Napolean House for a round of cocktails when a stranger ran up saying, "Man! You can't let your kid wear these!"</p><p>I set V down and saw that someone had given him a strand of penis beads. For those of you now acquainted with New Orleans, that's not some weird sex thing -- it's just a strand of beads that has plastic genitalia where the round things normally are. V had placed the beads over his head and worn them around while riding on my shoulders. It's anyone's guess as to how long he was up there like that. I would love to be able to read the minds of the few people who saw him and were aghast.</p><p>One Mardi Gras not too long after that, he was on my shoulders when a religious nutjob started yelling to me about being a sinner. "He's going to grow up to be a fornicator, if you don't get him out of New Orleans!" he shouted.</p><p>"I should hope so. Why wouldn't I want my grown son to have a happy sex life," I replied. This lead to much laughter from the poor saps who were just trying to watch their parade in sin-loving peace.</p><p>So maybe lesson two is that you shouldn't bring toddlers to the French Quarter. But to be honest, the penis beads were funny, so if you can avoid the zealots, I think the French Quater and toddlers mix just fine.</p><p>When the Saints made the Super Bowl, we headed back to the French Quarter again, this time without children. (In fact, it was V's birthday, but we just lied and told him that his birthday was the following weekend. Little kids believe anything.)</p><p>We pretty much had the championship day thing down by then. It was a nearly perfect day. We had good drinks. We ran into friends. We ended up with a good screen where we could watch the game. When the game was over, the whole bar spilled out into Burbon Street and I hugged and danced with strangers for quite a while. After that, Mrs. theskinnyonbenny was still with me, but our friends were hopeless lost in the huge crowd. Mrs. theskinnyonbenny and I went to Daisy Duke's for chili-cheese omelets, and even as I type this a decade later, my stomach turns when I think about it.</p><p>Rule number three: NEVER eat at Daisy Duke's.</p><p>Rule number four: Getting drunk is fine, but you want to be able to remember at least some of the plays in the second half when you wake up the next day.</p><p>That brings us to Monday. Shelly came down, and we got a good seat in front of a million sharp TVs two hours before game time. Drinks flowed, but in my case, it was mostly beer, and I remember every second of it. The shots at the end of the night were probably a bad idea, but I didn't hang over on Tuesday, so they're allowed.<br><br><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/championship-night.png" data-lightview-caption="championship-night.png" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/championship-night.png" alt="/img/championship-night.png"  ><br><span class="caption"></span></a></p><p>Okay, so I got naked in the kitchen.</p><p>That part was fun. The part that wasn't was when Shelly sent me her pictures the next morning. I'm still really pretty, but I'm almost 50, have a big belly, and still have no ass at all. My naked is fun, but it's also funny looking.</p><p>Rule number five: make your friends put away their phones when you get naked.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://theskinnyonbenny.com/blog2/happy-new-year-internet</guid><title>Happy New Year, Internet</title><description>A few guilty paragraphs about not posting more, a funny text message, and a video from New Year's that made us laugh.</description><link>https://theskinnyonbenny.com/blog2/happy-new-year-internet</link><pubDate>Thu, 9 Jan 2020 09:07:00 -0500</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Happy New Year, Internet.</p><p>I don't post much any more, but I write a little more often than I post.

The sheet rock is a lot thicker than today's, so longer screws are needed to reach the outlet box.

This week, I took those mind-wanderings and started typing them out as a post.  Whose music is dentist-office appropriate, but still good?  Let the debate begin.</description><link>https://theskinnyonbenny.com/blog2/the-best-artist-that-no-one-hates</link><pubDate>Wed, 5 Dec 2018 11:46:00 -0500</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was at the dentist last week, forced into captive listening to the light rock radio station in town for the first time since the last time my teeth were cleaned. I like to pretend that the hygenist is a torturerer, trying to get important secrets out of me. I urge the government to never entrust me with important secrets, because even though the metal hook probing my tender, neglected gums feels kind of good, my brain is still screaming, "I'LL TALK! I'LL TALK."</p><p>The music this particular day started surprisingly good. We started with Kings of Leon followed by Imagine Dragons. It had me wondering whether I was such and old dad that I might need to dedicate a preset button to the light rock channel. I've forgotten who was up third, but I remember thinking that it wasn't bad. Up fourth was the inevitible airing of Phil Collins's "In the Air Tonight." No one has been to the dentist and <i>not</i> heard In the Air Tonight since 1987.</p><p>I understand that the dentists have to limit their playlists music that no one dislikes. For the past week, I've been trying to mentally think of the best artist you could choose, with the caveat that no one dislikes the music. You immediately have to strike,</p><ul><li>hard rock (sorry Van Halen and Jane's Addiction -- maybe the best two rock bands period),</li>
<li>hip hop (no one dislikes Chance the Rapper. except "I don't like rap" people, who would like it if they gave it a chance),</li>
<li>anything with unusual chords or chord progressions (Radiohead and Arcade Fire -- it was nice while it lasted),</li>
<li>jazz, blues, classical, opera, etc.  There are vocal critics who hate it all,</li>
<li>any pop or dance music that's too electronic or funky,</li>
<li>anything too twangy,</li>
<li>anything dirty (so painful to scratch Prince and Madonna off the list)</li></ul><p>What's left? Who's the best artist that everyone likes?</p><p>(Nothing and no one, to be honest, but here's what I've come up with as the best potential answers.)</p><strong>Billy Joel:</strong><p>This is thex first answer that popped into my head, and perhaps still the best.</p><strong>Dave Matthews Band:</strong><p>In their heyday, I was put off of DMB by a super irritating coworker who was super enthusiastic about DMB. Her constant prattling made me want to hate DMB, and I'm only just now getting past that.</p><strong>Tina Turner:</strong><p>Maybe my personal favorite, but not as univerally beloved as she should be.</p><strong>Coldplay:</strong><p>Radiohead without the unusualness, maybe? But along with the interesting sounds go the... well, the interesting sounds. Not sure if they belong here or not.</p><strong>Johnny Cash:</strong><p>Popped into my head late, but I think the man in black is a good addition.<br><br><strong>Avett Brothers:</strong> Potential winner here, but can you really say that everyone likes a band that unashamedly includes cellos in many tracks? I think you can, but I understand if you want to quibble.</p><strong>Hall and Oats, Huey Lewis and the News, Loverboy:</strong><p>80s hit machines, but we're looking for the best, and none of them are better than Billy Joel.</p><strong>Cage the Elephant, Kings of Leon, The Kooks:</strong><p>All super good, and I don't know anyone who dislikes them. I know a lot of old people who have never heard of any of these bands though.</p><strong>The Killers:</strong><p>Just thought of this as I was finishing up. Might be the winner.</p><p>Give me more ideas. I'm sure there are a ton.</p><p><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/greenline.gif" class="greenline" alt="{{divider}}" /></p><strong>Update:</strong><p>This sort of came up in conversation over Thanksgiving week, after I had written most of the post, but before I actually posted it. (You'd be surprised at how much I write and discard.) It seems like Billy Joel probably does win the title of Best Artist that Nobody Hates.</p><p>When I was a kid, my dad had these work friends who were nuts about being Catholic and about Billy Joel. We went to their house for what was probably a Super Bowl. My family always went to watch the Super Bowl with Dad's work friends rather than with their real friends, of which there were plenty of other gatherings.

After sledding, we went out for gumbo. We came home, and they all left me alone in a hot bath, where I leaned my head back, and slept like a baby while flurries continued to fall out of my window.

(That was my college football underdog pick this week. And in case you're wondering, they did win.)</li></ol><ol start="2"><li>Is Odell Beckham Jr going to play today? (Fantasy implications, and the Giants aren't telling.)</li></ol><ol start="3"><li>Is there still such a place as Key West? (Still not quite sure what the answer is.)</li></ol><p>From there, I went through all of the college football scores from yesterday. There were a lot of good games, and I missed a lot of action. I was, however, the only person outside of Indiana or Virginia to watch the whole IU/Virginia game. Indiana is for real, y'all. That game wasn't nearly as close as the score showed.</p><p>I was instrigued by the Tulane 21 - Navy 23 score. Navy is one of those teams that I pull for, with no real reason. I like that it's one of the four D-I schools whose name is also a color. And I like that part of their cirriculum is to get out on Chesapeake Bay in sail boats. I hope our real navy never gets to the point where we rely on sail any more, but I like that they're getting the kids ready, just in case.</p><p>I always check in on Tulane too. Parltly, because my friend Dave picks Tulane as his underdog as reliably as crazies will wait out a hurricane in Key West, and partly because I just pull for all of the in state schools, assuming none of them ever get good enough to challenge LSU.</p><p>I'm wondering if CBSSN replays games during the week, like the ESPN channels do during slow fall weekdays. Google wouldn't tell me, no matter how I phrased the question, I couldn't really find anything. But I found a highlight reel on YouTube, posted by Tulane, so I decided to <a href="https://youtu.be/NqOENqJj4lk" target="_blank">watch it</a>.</p><p>If you follow that link and watch, you will wonder like I did how Tulane didn't win 45-3. I don't think I'm getting all of the highlights here.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://theskinnyonbenny.com/blog2/shipping-news</guid><title>Shipping News</title><description>I was helping V with a book report, and there's a giant picture of an old ship with six thousand little labels for every line and sail.

What parents would name their baby boy "Ham?"<br><br>The only streets I didn't have to Google are Rod Laver and Chris Evert. For Chris's street, I have to think that someone in the early 80s made an effort to find a female tennis player worthy of street naming. They could have gone with Margaret Court and hidden the fact that this street was a decades-late addition, but no one thought of that.</p><p>The name is also a clue to when the street was commissioned. In the early 80s, she was Chris Evert Lloyd. I know she was married to a skier named Andy Mills later. And then didn't she marry Greg Norman in the 2000's? I'd look that up, but I already spent an inordinate amount of time trying figure out how to do the ö in Björn, so I'm going to leave the Us Weekly caliber research to you readers.</p><p>If I'm ever in charge of naming the streets in a subdivision, I'm going with the most mundane nouns I can think of:</p><ul><li>Shoe Polish Lane</li>
<li>Grip Tape Way (inspired by tennis names, I guess)</li>
<li>Talcum Powder Drive</li>
<li>Crushed Limestone Circle</li></ul><p>I could keep going. I'm not sure why this amuses me as much as it does. "Come over to my buddy Ham's house. He lives at 444 Talcum Powder Drive."

Instead, I took the helm of the motor van <i>San Clemente</i> for a tour of the Pacific Northwest. We started out north of Seattle, ferried through the San Juan Islands of Washington, crossed over the Vancouver island in Canada. From there, we crossed British Columbia and visited several Canadian National Parks in their Rocky Mountain range. Finally, we circled back into Washington for a few days before heading home.</p><p>It was an excellent trip. The people of Washington and British Columbia must be like "aw, yeah, hmmmm..." every time they go somewhere for the scenery, as it's very hard to match what they left behind. A lot like us in Louisiana sampling food at our travel destinations. (I will give the nod to Pacific oysters over Gulf oysters, but on the other hand, you pay for them.)</p><p>Several times, I've said that you could pick the ugliest two mile square of British Columbia, plop it down where the town of Shreveport sits today, and you would have a U.S. National Park that would draw millions of visitors every year.

She waved us down to use a phone, but she couldn't catch her friend. We wished her well and went to set up our campsite.</p><p>Once we were all set up, her boyfriend called back. He was something like six hours away and wanted us to bring a phone back to her so they could figure out what to do. I already had the tent up on the van and a hammock tied to the luggage rack, so the boys and I started to walk.

The kids will probably spill a cup of flour all over the kitchen within the next 120 seconds, but for now, this is an accurate view.</p><p>There's a reason that I feel like I need to emphasize our cleanliness.</p><p>And it's not because my sister's cleaning lady posts before-and-after pictures of her work on her website. That's the most horrifying thing I've ever read. (And yes, she's made the cut more than once.)</p><p>It's because Kolya jumped out of my Jeep at school drop off this morning, and sprinted full-bore toward the elementary building. Excited to tell his friends and teacher that he got a fright this morning.</p><p>He picked up his backpack to leave for school, only to find it occupied by a <i>giant, dying rat</i>. Fuuuuuuuuck!</p><p>Let's back up a little.</p><p>Mrs. theskinnyonbenny was working yesterday afternoon, when she spotted a rodent head poking out from the hole in the wall from where a bunch of network cable comes into the room. She sprinted out of there, and we had this text exchange.</p><p>I searched for it when I got home, but I couldn't find it. The cat was just lounging on the couch with no worries at all. I figured it poked its head out took a peek, and left. To be safe, I crammed the hole full of steel wool (rats hate it, I am told) and covered it up. Then, I put down a glue trap and locked the room up.</p><p>Kolya and I checked the trap this morning. I didn't have my glasses or contacts on, but I could see well enough to know there was no rat on the trap. Had I been wearing them, I would have seen that something had gotten stuck there, eaten the cheese, and then pried itself off. But I didn't.</p><p>Fast forward an hour, Kolya screams in fear of the rat in his backpack. I tossed it out the door, and it lay on the ground barely breathing, almost as big as the cat. It was clearly poisoned and close to death, so I'm glad the cat didn't get into a tussle and poison himself in the process. Kolya was a little shaken up on the ride to school, but began to perk up when I asked if he was going to tell his friends or keep a lid on it.</p><p>It was a truly nasty morning, and I hope to never have a repeat of this.</p><h3> 2023 update:  this was posted in 2017 without its accompanying images.

Close to being able to drop V off. We've been side by side in the car for almost an hour, and we're still flipping through radio channels, trying to find some decent tunes that we aren't tired of.</p><p>For the 6th or 7th time in the hour, we land on the hip-hop oldies channel. It's "Banned in The U.S.A" by 2 Live Crew. We keep it on.</p><p>Maybe it's the current state of national affairs. Maybe it's that I'm a sucker for stories where the little guy sticks it to those who make the rules. I was tickled pink by <i>The People vs Larry Flynt</i>, <i>Private Parts</i>, and <i>Straight Outta Compton</i>, despite not being a big fan of Hustler or Howard Stern. (I do like a little N.W.A. now and then.)<br><br>But it strikes me that "Banned in the U.S.A" is a really good, and a very patriotic song. It's much more patriotic in its expression of "no one can trample on our right to free speech in this country" than the song it samples/spoofs. Politicians love to play the Boss's "Born in the U.S.A." at their events, presumingly having never listened to the lyrics. For you youngsters, it's an 80s hit about a guy who returns from was just to be shit on by an America who doesn't really care about his sacrifices. Again, it's hard not to think of current events.</p><p>I try to bring my mind back to the 80s. I was a member of the generation whose parents were losing their damned minds over the music. "Satanic lyrics" was in the news night after night. Record banning was the cause of the day. Three kids in West Memphis got convicted of murder with the only real evidence being that they liked to listen to metal and the adults were scared shitless.</p><p>The song ends, and another pile of poo is on behind. By now, V is at school, but I'm still in the car channel scanning. I stop on Outlaw Country. The song is Kenny Rogers "Coward of the County." It's a terrible country song released in 1979 that I heard on old dail-based radios in the 80s no less than 9000 times, but I haven't heard it in years. I settle in for one more listen.</p><p>The song tells the story of a guy who didn't like to fight. People made fun of him, but he was fine. Until one day, his wife was gang raped. Then, he fought the rapists.</p><p>Yes, for real. That's the story of the song.</p><p>Jesus H. Christ, it's a terrible song!<br><br>So to recap, parents in the 80s were okay with the rape song being on the radio all the time, but not the black kids on cassette tapes chanting "Hey, we want some pussy," a vulgarly worded, but entirely normal sentiment for young men.</p><p>Now that I've peaked your interests, I present what I promise is the only playlist to ever feature these three songs together:</p><iframe src="https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify%3Auser%3Abens4lsu%3Aplaylist%3A33FFFjxVaGGAJfahxDgt9Q" width="300" height="380" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" style="display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;margin-top:2.5em;"></iframe>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://theskinnyonbenny.com/blog2/read-this-one-aloud</guid><title>Read This One Aloud</title><description>This whole post is just one line....</description><link>https://theskinnyonbenny.com/blog2/read-this-one-aloud</link><pubDate>Mon, 1 May 2017 19:34:00 -0400</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If I lived up North, I would drive up to New Hampshire every couple of weeks to buy a hamster.

Women strolled past the cabinets every day to do their thing. The secret hoarding of the documents was long since public knowledge, but since they were out of the boss man's sight, he never followed up on his order that they be removed.</p><p>I can't imagine how annoying that would be for me if I worked there every day.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://theskinnyonbenny.com/blog2/its-mediocre-wednesday</guid><title>It's Mediocre Wednesday</title><description>A thought I had about the days in the Easter season, plus one of those observations that kids make.</description><link>https://theskinnyonbenny.com/blog2/its-mediocre-wednesday</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Apr 2017 10:39:00 -0400</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Some comedy troupe has surly filmed this exact scene, right?</p><div style="margin-left: 2em;">

I looked up to see two cars in the road at a funny angle, and I thought they had been in a little fender bender.</p><p>The driver of the first car was a well dressed black lady of about 30. The man at an angle behind her was well over 50, white, and had a loud New Orleans accent. He surprised me by shouting joyfully, "Hey! That's great! Thank you ma'am! God bless you!"</p><p>Now for two days, I can't quit trying to figure out what made him so happy. He was holding a coffee, but they weren't coming out of a drive through, and it seems like a lot of emotion for a free coffee. Some stranger paid for our coffee and donuts at Dunkin when I drove through before school with the kids a couple of weeks ago. Don't get me wrong -- it is nice. But I didn't jump out of my car to ask God to bring down blessings.</p><p>I really can't come up with anything satisfying.</p><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/greenline.gif" class="greenline" alt="{{divider}}" /><p>No googling during the reading of this post.</p><p>A couple of weeks ago, on a long boring drive, I tried to think of band names that have a color in them. With apologies to Jack Black, Jack White, and Pink, individual names don't count. Here's the initial list I came up with.</p><ul><li>Blue Oyster Cult</li>
<li>Deep Purple</li>
<li>The Black Keys</li>
<li>The White Stripes</li>
<li>Pink Floyd</li>
<li>Green Day</li>
<li>Black Sabbath</li>
<li>Black Kids (from whom I know one song, but it's a winner)</li></ul><p>I was with some of my family the next day, and we went through my list. While I was going through my list, my sister came up with Black Eyed Peas when I said The Black Keys. Huge oversight by me there.</p><p>A week later, my dad texted me this list...</p><ul>
<li>Blues Traveller</li>
<li>The Blue Notes</li>
<li>Ruby and the Romantics</li>
<li>Moody Blues</li>
<li>The Limeliters</li>
<li>Maroon Five</li>
<li>Redbone</li>
<li>The Slivertones</li>
<li>Quicksilver</li>
<li>Vanilla Fudge</li>
<li>Cream</li>
</ul><p>I only know half of those, but I'm sure the list is legit.</p><p>I just thought of Black Flag while sitting here tying this post.</p><p>Oh! and Pearl Jam. Pearl is a color, right?</p><p>You can play too, but you have to do it all from memory.

But then again, maybe it won't be quite that bad. Here are some reasons to be happy about where we are.</p><ul><li>Our new president is actually going to care that no one turned out for his inauguration, and about how bad his approval numbers are.  He may not have the mental capacity to do anything about it, but either he'll get better, or he'll bellyache on Twitter to everyone's amusement.</li>

<li>There is no momentum at all for a full repeal of Obamacare.  It sounds very unlikely that people with pre-existing conditions will be forced to go without coverage again.  I predict a plan that looks very very much like Obamacare, and the GOP can take credit for all the lives saved by Trumpcare.  Fine.</li>

I got up early and hauled a small tailgate party's worth of chairs, tables, and music out into the driveway so that I could collapse exhaustedly into my chair and nurse my breakfast alcohol as healthy people who had already run 23 miles (23!) that morning passed.</p><p>The first runner passed a bit under two hours after the start of the race, which worked out to a 5 minute mile pace. The last racer was some time after the race had been going on for 5 hours, and he was accompanied by the embarrassing peloton of police cars and support vehicles that follow the last runner. I need to tip the cap to the runner who was keeping himself a few blocks ahead of last place while drunk as a skunk.<br><br><a class="lightview alignright" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/vmarathon.jpg" data-lightview-caption="V, enjoying the Louisiana Marathon of Staying In Pajamas." data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/vmarathon.jpg" alt="/img/vmarathon.jpg" width="350px"><br><span class="caption alignleft">V, enjoying the Louisiana Marathon of Staying In Pajamas.</span></a></p><p>The demeanor of the runners who pass is anything from ulta-serious (ignoring those of us who shout support with grim determination on their faces) to those who stop, eat, drink, and even take selfies with us. I'd love to get copies of those from over the years. A lot of the runners are super fun, and as you would expect, the further back in the race, the more fun the participants.</p><p>Stupidly, I didn't have a camera with me, and that caused me to miss two images that we would all laugh about for years to come. The first was escaped beagle Lily, with her ancient joints and 200% of ideal body weight catching sight of all of the runners passing from the spot she was back toward her house. She slipped into the stream of people and sprinted right along with them, ears flopping and tail wagging. She covered the half block as quickly as the runners and immediately flopped down for a happy rest.</p><p>My second missed image was Vanya, bored with holding out cups with water, nuts, or juice, asking if he can hold out a beer. I gave my assent, and he picked a 10oz can of Miller Light out of someone's ice chest and extended his arm into the river of runners. No one in the first wave took it, so he sprinted up the block to meet the next group. I looked up to see the 10 year old trying to force a cold beer onto the runners RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE COP who was there to block the intersection.</p><p>I called him home and explained how Dad didn't really relish the idea of sobering up in a jail cell. The officer mercifully pretended not to notice. (Pro tip: when a policeman blocks off an intersection near your house, walk down and offer him full access to drinks and bathrooms. They probably won't take you up on it, but they are always appreciative.)</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://theskinnyonbenny.com/blog2/2017-resolution-wipe-your-butt</guid><title>2017 Resolution: Wipe Your Butt</title><description>On Christmas morning, I went in for my morning deuce, and found that there was about three squares of toilet paper left on the roll.

I had been in both of the other bathrooms the day before, and I knew that this was the extent of toilet paper in our house.</p><p>Being full of Christmas spirit, I did the charitable thing by leaving my shorts on the floor, climbing into the bathtub, and using the spray nozzle for a warm, clean, and refreshing bidet experience. Then, when I pulled my shorts back up, they were somehow soaking wet.</p><p>No problem at home, but is there any worse feeling than pulling up your pants in a public restroom and finding that they have sopped up a puddle of mystery wetness while you did your business? When that happens to me, it takes all of my mental energy, repeating to myself, "It's just water. It's just water. It's just water..." until I'm distracted enough to forget about it. It's just the worst.</p><p>When the extended family showed up, they brought a couple of rolls in a gift bag, so the day was saved. Later, my sister reminded me that I have a box of butt wipes in there too. I'm singularly focused on those being residents of the car's glove compartment. Actually using them to wipe butts in the most needed moment never even occurred to me.</p><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/greenline.gif" class="greenline" alt="{{divider}}" /><p>On an unrelated note, I haven't posted a link to any cool tunes lately.

How long to I have to keep hanging up crappy ornaments that my kids made in preschool?</b><p>I hate to break it to you, but you have to keep hanging that shit forever.

I don't even know what this could have been BEFORE it was mangled. But it's a white popsicle stick where some preschool teacher at some point wrote my youngest son's name on it, so here it hangs for all eternity.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/ornament2.JPG" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group2"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/ornament2.JPG" alt="/img/Mustang Sally" width="350px"><br><span class="caption"></span></a><p>Here's a teeny-tiny Wally World moose head slash beer mug for insect-sized drinkers. There's red writing on the back that someone with younger eyes than mine tells me says, "National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation." This is just about perfect, because that one had nothing to do with Wally World.<br><br>I have no recollection of ever having seen this ornament before. It was probably on the end of a zipper on something that someone else got for Christmas last year when it accidentally got dropped in with our ornaments.

It's the crappiest of many ornaments that my mom made me take from their home.</p><p>The most horrifying thing about this is that it's dated 1984. That puts me at having painted this at the ripe old age of 13.

That's ironic, because as we left, we saw the sign pointing to the actual haunted ones with the chainsaw weilding manics and zombies. The kids wouldn't even go down the wide open dark path that lead to the actual haunted maze, so Mrs. theskinnyonbenny had to go through by herself. She confirmed what I heard by talking to the mother of some other chicken littles -- that it was fun, but not particularly scary.</p><p>Saturday morning, we left the house and headed for New Orleans to piece together costumes and top that off with the Boo at the Zoo trip. Our timing was great again, and we got to the haunted train ride just as the sky flipped from dusk to dark. K got on the train full of courage and even took an empty seat in front of me. But before it pulled away, he started to falter and was back in my lap. The courage disappeared entirely as we rounded the first curve and were treated to convincing screams of a torture victim on a table surrounded by fake maniacs.</p><p>We were toward the fornt, so most of the monsters popping out of bushes to menace the riders were behind us, but by the end, he was in full blown tears. A succesful haunted train ride, in my book.</p><p>We followed up with the trick or treating, a few games, and got a couple of free Pelican-logoed selfie sticks from their setup. And then, back to the car and home.</p><p>The next weekend, we went to New Orleans for a magic show and Voodoo fest. The magic show was cool, highlighted by a nut who stuffed a coin into his eye socket and back around the back of his eyeball. I think he snorked it through his sinuses and palmed it from there, but it appeared that he cut open his forearm and extracted the coin from there. Either way, it was pretty revolting. The kids liked the escape artist dropped into a water tank best.</p><p>At Voodoo Fest on Saturday, V made me feel like the worst parent in the world by getting busted trying to sneak in one of my flasks. I didn't think they would do a thorough kid search. K was distraught that we would even make the attempt. "WHY WOULD WE DO THIS? WE'RE NOT BAD PEOPLE!"</p><a class="lightview alignright" href="http://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/gal/138%20-%20Halloween%202016/resIMG_20161029_134018_6393.JPG" data-lightview-caption="Voodoo - Play by the beer tent." data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="http://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/gal/138%20-%20Halloween%202016/resIMG_20161029_134018_6393.JPG" alt="http://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/gal/138%20-%20Halloween%202016/resIMG_20161029_134018_6393.JPG" width="350px"><br><span class="caption alignleft">Voodoo - Play by the beer tent.</span></a><p>No son, the bad people are the ones who want to take away Dad's vodka.</p><p>I joke, but it was a low feeling.</p><p>We managed to see at least most of a lot of different acts.

Almost entirely, we were tied up at Pontchartrain Landing on the lakeshore. It's an almost unknown RV Park and Marina, and not at all a bad place to hole up for a week. Although it was almost entirely too cold to swim, there is a pool, a safe patch of water for the kids to dinghy and paddleboard, and all of it is in view from the bar. Other than one bartender, the staff was very friendly and helpful.</p><a class="lightview alignright" href="http://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/gal/136%20-%20Easter%20Trip%202016/resIMG_20160327_154156_5693.JPG" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="http://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/gal/136%20-%20Easter%20Trip%202016/resIMG_20160327_154156_5693.JPG" alt="http://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/gal/136%20-%20Easter%20Trip%202016/resIMG_20160327_154156_5693.JPG" width="350px"><br><span class="caption alignleft">All lined up for the Gay Easter Parade</span></a><p>And what an eventful week. On top of goofing around at the ol' landing, we visited the zoo, aquarium, IMAX, parades, bowling, a cool lights display in city park, Preservation Hall, and went to a barbecue festival. We probably ate at least five top-notch meals and several more very good ones. We had warm sunny weather, and freezing cold rain.</p><p>All of that bookended by two days of sailing.</p><a href="http://theskinnyonbenny.com/pg4.php?spgmGal=136%20-%20Easter%20Trip%202016">It's mostly (but not all) documented in the pictures</a><p>, and this is one of my favorite collections in a really long time.</p><p>One of the things that doesn't make the pictures is a dinghy ride that I took with the kids. We were passing a family on the bank who was trying to fish. One of the family was a litte person.</p><p>I saw K looking over there, and right on cue, his eyes got big and he started to point. I grabbed his hand and told him it was rude. And I suggested that he should whisper whatever it was that he wanted to tell me. I knew that this would be my opportunity to give him the "people come in all shapes" sort of lesson.</p><a class="lightview alignright" href="http://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/gal/136%20-%20Easter%20Trip%202016/data/normal.jpg" data-lightview-caption="After walking to the zoo." data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="http://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/gal/136%20-%20Easter%20Trip%202016/data/normal.jpg" alt="http://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/gal/136%20-%20Easter%20Trip%202016/data/normal.jpg" width="350px"><br><span class="caption alignleft">After walking to the zoo.</span></a><p>He leaned in and stage whispered, "That man just put his hook in the water with no bait on it!"</p><p>Ahh, yes.

One evening, we were walking down the road, having just finished mauling a candy apple. K looked like a clown with all of the red sugar dye on his hands and face, and there was a looming dinner reservation. The nearest place that looked family friendly was Bubba Gump's, so we dashed into the restaurant, and found the bathroom.</p><p>When K and I came out, V had the bar lined up with cokes for us all, and he had even taken the liberty of ordering himself a souvenir glass that lit up.<br><br>The waiter made a special trip to tell me what a cool and confident kid he was, and even said that he hopes his own new son grows up like to be like V.

I'm not nearly old enough to have been married twenty years, just as I am not nearly old enough to have a younger sister who dotes on grandchildren, yet here we are in a weird parallel universe where both things are ture.</p><p>As I realize that it's not exactly commonplace for someone as youthful and handsome as myself to have been married so long, I thought I would post some secrets of marital longevity.</p><ol><li><b>Have opposing chicken wing preferences.</b>  Perhaps no single factor leads to more marital harmony than sharing a plate of chicken wings without feeling like your partner keeps snagging the wings that you wanted to eat.  If you prefer the drumette, find a partner who prefers the forearm, and vice versa.

There really should be a word for the forearm part that we universally acknowledge.  I just googled <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=parts+of+a+chicken+wing&tbm=isch&tbo=u&source=univ&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjUxaj77sLJAhVB7D4KHalSChUQsAQIHA&biw=1710&bih=731" target="_blank">parts of a chicken wing</a>, and there are a variety of opinions to what it should be called.  Forearm works for me, but I understand the inclination to find a word that sounds more like food.

Dammit, I'm hungry.  I wish I hadn't looked at all of those pictures of chicken wings.

</li><li><b>Just drive.</b>  If your partner hates to drive, and you would rather sleep or read than drive, just buy an energy drink and take your spot behind the wheel.  Odds are that your road-hating partner thinks that four inches is plenty of following distance on the interstate when he or she is driving anyway, and if so, you'll have trouble drifting off to sleep while your pilot stares into the road with the intensity of Mario Andretti making 210 mph ovals in heavy traffic.  Easier for everyone if you just take the wheel.

As an added bonus, most people instinctively give the driver control of the radio.  I've personally made my family listen all sorts of sports talk idiots that they must have dreaded with every fiber of their being.  Once, I made them listen to a Wimbledon final on the radio while we drove through the back country nothingness between Miami and Orlando.  Have you ever listened to tennis on the radio?  "Serve is in, and back.  Federer hits it back, and back, to the corner, back across, over, back, AND IT CATCHES THE BASELINE FOR A POINT!!!!"

Who's point?  It gets very hard to tell.  Just keep driving.

</li><li><b>Wet your whistle.</b>  All of your partner's grating little annoyances turn into charming little quirks when mixed with a warm, sweet, stomach coating of your favorite intoxicant.  Not only that, but the kids don't sound as loud, the money shortages don't seem that dire, and after a drinks or two, either of you is perfectly willing to scoop up that wet cat hairball bare-handed.

You've got to be a little careful here, especially if one of you is a fan of the fightin' liquors (whiskey, tequila).  Also, too many evening cocktails before homework time really, really sucks.  A week or two ago, I might have signed off on a reading page that didn't really get read, and now I get lobbied for homework cheats every couple of days.

</li><li><b>Establish a common rooting interest.</b>  You want to have at least one area where you're rooting for the same team.  It can be a mutually shared hatred of the Patriots, a common desire to elect the biggest douchebag in the city council as the next mayor, or a fanatic following of the dude your partner dated in high school who is now the 34th ranked professional bowler in the world.  That way, when you sense that the conversation is going to take a turn toward, "did you ever change the upstairs light bulbs like you said you would?" you can throw it in a different direction with something like, "Did you see Donald Trump mock that reporter with the googoo face?"

I don't have anything else to say here, but I have some style issue where my list spacing sucks unless I have more than one paragraph in the list.  No time to figure it out, q.e.d., this sentence.

</li><li><b>Lots and lots of oral sex.</b>  This might not really be applicable to my own life, but I can't imagine that anyone in a relationship is too very unhappy when oral sex is part of the daily routine.  If you are unhappily married despite lots of trips where the trolley rolls downtown, please let me know in the comments.  You, my friend, are one of the most fascinating people we've encountered.

It's time to start publishing my gripes.</p><p>Gripe #1:</p><p>These two DirectTV commercials, which attempt (poorly) to make fun of merging cable companies. I'll post the first one. I know there's at least one more, wherein the guy from all of those mockumentaries dumps boiled shrimp and ice all over the conference room table.</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/n7o99zxhTKs" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><p>It's not just that they've come up with a not-funny ad for these comedy stars to read. It's not that YouTube makes me watch a commercial so that I can get to the commercial that I'm trying to watch. It's that they piss on the whole premise of this spot by ending with, "Now part of the AT&amp;T family."</p><p>Did they have this in the works before the AT&amp;T/DirectTV takeover and then just not have the balls to kill it? Or do the marketing people have their heads so far up the corporate behind that they don't recognize their own face?</p><p>(I'm could have probably worked that metaphor out a little better.)</p><p>Just really stupid.</p><p>And, it really is gripe-worthy that YouTube makes you watch a commercial to watch a commercial. If I had known that one before I started to write, it would have it's own entry in the ennumeration.</p><p>Gripe #2:</p><p>I really like Apple Pay. I use it where I can. One of those places is Whole Foods. But when my total at Whole Foods is over some threshold -- and I'm not sure where this threshold is, but it's somewhere between a coffee and a week of groceries -- they make me sign the screen pad when I pay.</p><p>The whole point of the signature is to prove that it was me at the register if I decide to claim it wasn't. But with Apple Pay, the system has already validated my thumbprint. That's WAY better proof that I'm me than my signature is. Get rid of that, Whole Foods!</p><p>That was fun. Let's do this more often!</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://theskinnyonbenny.com/blog2/mandeville-sailing</guid><title>Mandeville Sailing</title><description>A description of my post.</description><link>https://theskinnyonbenny.com/blog2/mandeville-sailing</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 Oct 2015 23:05:00 -0400</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Saturday and Sunday, it rained like hell. We've had nothing but beautiful weather for as many days as I can remember, and I especially can't think of when it was as wet and as ugly as it was this weekend.</p><p>But the weekend before was the last in a long line of absolutely perfect weather. We decided to sail to Mandeville, a town that's usually four or five hours from our home dock. It's a nice little town, with a publicly funded wall fitted with water and power that's absolutely free to the visiting sailor. Once there, you have a playground for the kids right there, the yacht club ( = bar for mom and dad, plus another playground), and many other places to eat or drink within an easy lakefront walk. It's certainly worth an overnight trip.</p><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/142957004?color=b5b5ce&byline=0&portrait=0" width="650" height="366" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe><p><a href="https://vimeo.com/142957004">Sailing into Mandeville 2015-10-17</a> from <a href="https://vimeo.com/user244752">ben schultz</a> on <a href="https://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p><span class="caption alignleft">Sailing from Slidell to Mandeville in two minutes.</span><p>We had a fast and comfortable sail into town, and we reached the public dock about 30 minutes ahead of sunset. One other vessel was on the wall, and a few drunk visitors came over and grabbed our lines for us. They made the tie-up extremely easy. We spent a little while putting boat stuff away and digging out sweatshirts, shoes, and a camera for the walk into town. On our way out, our dockside friends expressed interest in hanging out with Lily instead of having us lock her down in the cabin. I knew that Lily would rather hang out with people than be locked up alone, and knew that they could just stick her back aboard if they got tired of her. And if they turned out to be maniacs who eat dog? Well, Lily's 10 now. We would miss her, but we've had a good run.</p><p>We ended up walking to a restaurant called The Beach, which we've visisted many times. It's a good place to watch football (and this was during the LSU/Florida game) and there's a play area so that kids can entertain themselves some without bothering the grown-ups. I was surprised that there were plenty of empty seats even though we got there right at kickoff.</p><p>When the game was almost over, I got a call from a number I didn't know. Guessing that it was dog-related, I picked up. An irritated, bitchy woman told me to come get my dog, who had been tied to a post next to the boats. I told her that I would, but that we were walking, and it would take us a little time to get there.<br><br>I called her back a few minutes later and told her just to put Lily on the black sail boat. She said, "I'm not comfortable leaving her on a boat by herself." Suit yourself, sister. I went right back to watching the game, which was too close to abandon at that point.</p><p>Once LSU took possession for the last time, and the game seemed to be in hand, we got up to leave. My phone rang again. This time, it was the Mandeville police. I explained that I had told the woman that I would be a little while, and that I was in route, on foot, back to the boats. The officer seemed fine with that.</p><p>On the way back, a patrol car pulled up to asked for us by name. I'm still curious if they knew our name from a phone number lookup or from a lookup of the boat name.</p><p>Once we got closer to the boats, a different office met us on foot. He asked for our story, and warned us that the drunk people were troublemakers. We made a mild defense of them and expressed surprise that the town's police force seemed to have mobilized on a Saturday night, just on account of an overfed beagle. The officer told us something like, "It's because nothing ever happens in this town. It's like Mayberry. Literally. Believe me, this is the most excitement we'll have all night."</p><p>Then he told us that the local teenagers would be along the section of street next to our boats to hang out after dark. He told us to let them know if the kids were unruly, as he would relish a reason to run them all out of there.</p><p>Back along the water, the nosy dog lover had Lily on a leash. I think she wanted to give me a lecture, but my walking up with one kid on my shoulders and another holding my arm took the wind out of her sails. I just said, "Sorry for the trouble," and she replied, "okay."</p><p>Dog lover left pretty quickly, and not long after, crazy semi-homeless came by to apologize. We told him that there was no problem and offered him a beer. Mrs. theskinnyonbenny referred to dog lady as a busybody, which is now Oscar's favorite word.<br><br>"Busy body. That's just the word I was looking for! She was a busybody!"</p><p>A little while later, I could hear him on the other boat. "Like that lady over there said, she was a busybody!"</p><p>We ended up bullshitting with the members of the other crew for a while. They were a couple from New York, who had worked their way down over the course of several years. One gets the impression that they might just be staying one step ahead of the law. A real mariner <i>Dukes of Hazard</i> type of thing. They would probably make for a good reality show. The third member of the crew was Oscar, who Mrs. theskinnyonbenny compared to the scary bounty hunter guy from <i>Raising Arizona</i>.</p><p>Oscar was itching for a fight, and the only enemies he could muster were the high school kids, who come to the lakefront to sit in their cars and stare into their cell phones late at night. I didn't see any sign of drinking, smoking pot, sex, and I didn't even hear loud music. I'm glad I grew up in the 80s. His partner talked him down the few times he expressed his need to scratch the itch.</p><a class="lightview alignright" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/mandevilleoscar.jpg" data-lightview-caption="Oscar sees us off in style." data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/mandevilleoscar.jpg" alt="/img/mandevilleoscar.jpg"><br><span class="caption alignleft">Oscar sees us off in style.</span></a><p>Once Oscar made moves as if he were going to sleep in our cockpit, the captain of this little crew took the further step of herding the group to bed down where they belong.</p><p>Before we got ourselves down, we chatted with a friendly family from Tupelo, who was visiting the lakefront to try to catch fish, and then with a guy with a guitar, who came aboard and played some pretty good tunes for half an hour or so. It turns out that he had been at some kind of show, and at the end, the band invited audience members to jam with him, and he was riding high from performing well. I wish I knew the name of our 1:30AM companion, because he really was very good, and I wouldn't mind hearing him play again some time soon.</p><p>And that concluded the oddest dockside night that I can remember.</p><p>The next day, we thundered out of Mandeville, flying the new spinnaker in 10-14 knot winds. Velvet Elvis was absolutely flying downwind, in a way that I didn't know was possible. But not before a noisy sendoff from Oscar, who appeared out of nowhere to see us off the dock (in front of a large assembling regatta) with hearty screaming ("VANYA! ROCK ON LITTLE MAN!!!"), and with the waving of a Confederate Flag crossed with a silhouetted machine gun and some writing that I couldn't make out.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://theskinnyonbenny.com/blog2/summer-pattern</guid><title>Summer Pattern</title><description>A description of my post.</description><link>https://theskinnyonbenny.com/blog2/summer-pattern</link><pubDate>Tue, 9 Jun 2015 21:00:00 -0400</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is the third week since schools let out in Baton Rouge, and the city is firmly situated into the rhythms of Summer. Traffic is better, people are out until late, and packs of camp kids broadcast noises from unexpected city blocks.</p><p>After being mostly away the past two weeks, our kids started camps this week. Vanya is doing dance, arts, and music at a camp that he seems to be enjoying quite a bit. Kolya is going to one that seems pretty similar to preschool. Let's face it, though. Preschool is a day-long session of dicking around in fun ways that also happen to be educational for little kids. Drawing, Play-doh, songs. It's a pretty good day compared to yours and mine.</p><p>I took K to his first day yesterday. He was all into it as he held my hand and marched across the parking lot. By the time we got into the classroom, there was a little tear running down his cheek, and when he saw that I saw it, he went into full-blown leg grabbing at full strength. It's not nearly as heartbreaking as when toddler Vanya got nervous, as I know that K is one of the bravest little kids ever. He's certain to ask his skydiving instructor to set his jump suit on fire on his way out of the plane, just to up the adrenaline rush a tick or two.</p><p>I got him to a table where he could write and draw, and he didn't look back as I scurried out the door. At the end of the day, he had great things to say about camp. He described is teachers as, "REALLY nice" and claimed to like camp better than school, which is saying something.</p><p>Today, he wanted me to walk him into the building, but let him go through the classroom door by himself so that I wouldn't be seen. That's the Kolya I know.</p><p>He has really shown off his bravery at the pool this summer, doing spinners off the side deck or jumping recklessly in over his head in an attempt to beat kids twice his age and two-and-a-half times his height to a loose basketball. Sunday, he decided he was ready to jump to me off of the diving board. Sometimes, he landed right in front of me so I would easily lift him out of the water. Other times, he would plunge so deep that I would actually have to dive down and swim a couple of strokes to get deep enough to grab his little arms. He would be swimming toward the surface and grinning under water.</p><p>Here are a few recent pool pics, from a day where we waited about 3 hours for the little local storm to pass before they reopened the pool. As soon as we got in, there was one more rumble of thunder, but a lifeguard took pity and declared that it was only a passing truck.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/IMG_20150531_161350_1597.JPG" data-lightview-caption="Getting ready for a spinner" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/IMG_20150531_161350_1597.JPG" alt="/img/IMG_20150531_161350_1597.JPG" width="500px"><br><span class="caption">Getting ready for a spinner</span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/IMG_20150531_170018_1612.JPG" data-lightview-caption="Deep water ring retriever." data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/IMG_20150531_170018_1612.JPG" alt="/img/IMG_20150531_170018_1612.JPG" height="500px"><br><span class="caption">Deep water ring retriever.</span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/IMG_20150531_163558_1609.JPG" data-lightview-caption="Happy underwater boy." data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/IMG_20150531_163558_1609.JPG" alt="/img/IMG_20150531_163558_1609.JPG" width="350px"><br><span class="caption">Happy underwater boy.</span></a>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://theskinnyonbenny.com/blog2/gotcha-2015</guid><title>Gotcha 2015</title><description>A description of my post.</description><link>https://theskinnyonbenny.com/blog2/gotcha-2015</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 May 2015 09:52:00 -0400</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today is Vanya's <a href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/adop/page.php%3Ffn=adj05292007.content">gotcha day</a>, so happy day to a wonderful, kind-hearted, enthusiastic kid who has an amazing ability to make people smile.</p><p>Our tradition is that the kids get to do pretty much what they choose, including a trip to the store to pick out a toy.

I'm not sure if this has just started, or if I've just started noticing. But I keep hearing people say "bolth" instead of "both." Are these maniacs stooges for the "L" lobby?<br><br>It started out on radio shows, where I shrugged it off as an oddity of a local accent somewhere in these United States. But then, I heard it more and more. I even had a friend who kept saying it one weekend when we caught up, and it was all I could do not to strangle him in front of his children.</p><p>One day, while I was exercising (that should just about narrow it down to one and only one day), I queued up <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/podcasts/culturegabfest/2015/04/slate_s_culture_gabfest_on_wolf_hall_bruce_jenner_s_interview_and_avocados.html" target="_blank">this podcast</a>. The guest host was clearly just trying to get me to crack. BOLTH the book and the movie. BOLTH of Bruce Jenner's identities. Thanks to BOLTH of my co-hosts. I don't know if those specific examples are legit, but he had to have said that 39 times.</p><p>Meanwhile, Deadspin posted a series of longform articles on <a href="http://deadspin.com/tag/black-grantland" target="_blank">ESPN's "Black Grantland"</a> money-suck, and once I read the first word, I couldn't stop until I had devoured every sentence in the series. The inner workings of entertainment/media companies is really a fascinating topic, and this account ranks up there with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0047Y177U/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B0047Y177U&linkCode=as2&tag=theskinnyonbe-20&linkId=TGWWMKQS5LQDMLLW" target="_blank:>ESPN the book</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0047Y177U/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B0047Y177U&linkCode=as2&tag=theskinnyonbe-20&linkId=TGWWMKQS5LQDMLLW" target="_blank">Top of the Rock</a>.</p><p>The funniest part of this was the section of quotes that Whitlock included in his motivational playbook, half of which he attributes to himself. "Learn the rules so you'll know when and how to properly break them." Really, Jason Whitlock? You're the first to have come up with that sentiment? Because it really seems like something that someone else might have said before 2015. Just sayin'.</p><p>In less bitchy news (but still a little bitchy, I admit), I spent about 10 hours installing a new stereo on Velvet Elvis over the past two weekends. Like anything on a boat, the first try was a false start, with me undoing things that didn't need to be undone, finally figuring out what everything was, and then ultimately needing to order a cord that wasn't supplied with the stereo at all. For all of that, I got the ability to turn the volume up and down without walking down into the cabin, added Sirius radio, and got it where weather radar blobs show up on the chart plotter as we're sailing. In all, it's only questionably worth the time and money, but the volume thing has been great, and it will be really nice to see the storm cells if we're out at night and see lightning on the horizon.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://theskinnyonbenny.com/blog2/the-skinny-on-theskinny</guid><title>The Skinny on theskinny</title><description>A description of my post.</description><link>https://theskinnyonbenny.com/blog2/the-skinny-on-theskinny</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 May 2015 13:26:00 -0400</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A year ago January, a momentous milestone passed without notice. The 10th anniversary of theskinnyonbenny.com.</p><p>This year, I moved the site to a new web host for the first time.

Now, I'm left with stories half forgotten, hundreds and hundreds of pictures to curate (including some amazing sunset shots from our annual Easter cruise), and videos going back a year to post. I better start showing this site some attention.</p><p>The move did allow me a delightful trip down web memory lane.

<li>While brushing my teeth this morning, I tweaked my back.  For you youngsters who don't understand that terminology, the muscles suddenly (and somewhat violently) seize up and become painful and tight.</li>
<li>To sooth my back, I turned on the seat heater for my morning drive.  This wasn't uncomfortable, because despite being about 70 degrees, it was windy and overcast, and that felt a little cool.</li>
<li>When I got up around lunch time, my back was really quite stiff and sore.  I decided to walk two blocks to a convenience store to pick up a pack of Aleve.  I walked down, fixed a big giant diet coke, picked up a pack of Cheese-its for good measure, and totally forgot about the Aleve.</li></ul><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/greenline.gif" class="greenline" alt="{{divider}}" /><p>Kolya is pretty much past the toddler stage where he has cute mispronunciations of words. These are the only ones left that I an think of:</p><b>pan-a-cake</b><p>: There's a mix-up between the pat-a-cake and the pancake breakfast food. This word encompasses both.</p><b>applecado</b><p>: That green vegetable that you mush up to make guacamole. There's also some confusion between this and the jalapeno, as he touched a tiny bit of avocado to his lips and then claimed that he needed something to drink in order to relieve the burning.</p><b>yogrit</b><p>: Yogurt. He's gotten pretty much everyone in the house saying it this way. Vanya might have even come around to thinking that this is the correct pronunciation.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://theskinnyonbenny.com/blog2/drive-tunes-and-thoughts</guid><title>Drive Tunes and Thoughts</title><description>A description of my post.</description><link>https://theskinnyonbenny.com/blog2/drive-tunes-and-thoughts</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Mar 2015 19:10:00 -0400</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here's something that I thought (but didn't) tweet this morning:</p><blockquote>If SiriusXM has a counter for play count, I hope they used a BIGINT field to store it.</blockquote><p>Too nerdy to actually post, but here's the joke: A normal integer field (type INT) stores numbers up to about 2.1 billion. BIGINT basically uses two int fields together to store the number, so you basically get a number that's more than 2 billion times 4 billion. For those of you who are mathematically disinclined (Shelly Williams), that's a lot more than even eight billion!<br><br>(You get to double the 2nd one up to 4 billion because -- well shit, no one here cares why. You can always <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa933198%28v=sql.80%29.aspx" target="_blank">read this</a> if you feel you must.

Then, I almost never play it, because any time I want to hear it, it's already on the radio:</p><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CmQy6qgV2cM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><p>I'm ready for a full blown cover, in the style of a self-important piano bar singer in a swanky hotel lobby. Can someone do that for me?</p><p>There were several times in my youth where a group of us went to Pat O'Brian's piano bar in the French Quarter and loudly demanded that they play the Three's Company theme song. We could shout it for hours, filling their tip jar with our sweaty singles, and getting more and more obnoxious about being ignored. It never occurred to me then that they might not know how to play it.<br><br>Would it be true that anyone who is good enough to play in the Pat O's piano bar is good enough to play the Three's Company theme song by ear?</p><p>I imagine that today's pianists might not even be able to bring the Three's Company theme song to mind.</p><p>Let's go ahead and embed that one too.</p><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rX0cSaaLcXo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><p>Unrelated, except that it was also a drive-time musing:</p><p>I passed a big truck marked "TMI Transportation" the other morning.

In fact, it goes on and on forever.</p><p>Technically, Carnival starts on Kings Day (January 6) every year, and runs to a date that is chosen with some relation to Easter, which we all know comes from a ritual that the Pope does featuring chicken blood and full moons. I went to public school, so that's about all I know on how Easter gets scheduled.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/resIMG_20150207_185424_4030%202.JPG" data-lightview-caption="A super-fast swordsman before the Slidell parade.

</span></a><p>If you were paying attention in French class, you know that "Mardi Gras" really only refers to Fat Tuesday, which is the day before Ash Wednesday. But most of the kids are off of school for that whole week, so it gives one the sense that the holiday lasts through that entire weekend.<br><br>Parades start in earnest late in January. Our first this year was a Slidell parade, which featured a handful of floats, a Waffle house truck, and hundreds of little girl dance squads.<br><br><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/resIMG_20150207_200746_4043.JPG" data-lightview-caption="The Waffle House float/truck.

</span></a></p><p>The day after that, we went to New Orleans to retrieve some sort of thing for Mrs. theskinnyonbenny's parade. On our way home from there, we stopped at a lakeside restaurant in LaPlace, which was very good. As you know, I can't resist taking pictures of Louisiana waterways.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/resIMG_20150208_140412_4064%202.JPG" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/resIMG_20150208_140412_4064%202.JPG" alt="/img/resIMG_20150208_140412_4064 2.JPG" width="350px"><br><span class="caption"></span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/resIMG_20150208_140830_4072.JPG" data-lightview-caption="Lake Pontchartrain from LaPlace

</span></a><p>The next week, Mrs. theskinnyonbenny abandoned the rest of us on Tuesday to go down for parade prep. The kids and I ate Piccadilly, which holds one of my favorite policies -- treat dad's alone with their kids like they are incapable imbeciles. An employee hurried around to push one of our trays down the cafeteria line, and then carried it to the table for me.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/resIMG_20150212_181544_4101.JPG" data-lightview-caption="K waits at the hotel bar for his Shirley Temple to be prepared.

</span></a><p>We went down Thursday after school, caught three parades, which left the kids cold and exhausted. They were retired to my mother's hotel room, and the fun loving adults headed to the after party, which had delicious gumbo, and open bar, and a super-surprisingly good performance by Salt N Peppa. I didn't realize it, but Spinderella is the real talent up there. Let me add that she has aged extremely well.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/resIMG_20150213_011312_4114.JPG" data-lightview-caption="Salt N Peppa HERE!

Tonight, I wondered how much I will remember from the past month. The answer popped into my head as quickly as the question. I will only remember what I photograph or write here. So, as much as I wouldn't enjoy reading someone else's parenting blog....</p><p>(But I have been meaning to tell you all a story about my friend's German neighbor and the phrase "monkey nuts" for a good six months. Let this be a tease. I'll try to get that story posted over the Christmas break.)</p><p>In preschool a couple of weeks ago,<span class="spanEndPreview">&nbsp;</span> Kolya's class made gingerbread men. When they went out to play, the teachers hid them, and they told the kids that the cookies came to life, ran around the classroom, and dared the kids to find them. The kids looked all over, inside and out, and they couldn't find the runaway gingers.</p><p>The teachers asked each of us to send a letter reporting a sighting of our kid's men. Paul did me the favor of penning this one for me to send in.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/kolyasgingerbreadman.png" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/kolyasgingerbreadman.png" alt="/img/kolyasgingerbreadman.png"><br><span class="caption"></span></a><p>A couple of days later, the teachers hatched a plan to lure them back to school with a gingerbread house. Then plan was a success, and the kids got to eat their cookies.</p><p>On the other side of the sibling divide, Vanya doesn't want to eat sausage or chicken, because he put it together that it meant killing real live animals. You read that right. One won't eat an animal, while the other chows down on what he truly believes to be a live, sentient, intelligent being.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/penisice.JPG" data-lightview-caption="Ice sculpture?" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/penisice.JPG" alt="/img/penisice.JPG" height="350px"><br><span class="caption">Ice sculpture?</span></a><p>In other family news this month, we took the kids down to New Orleans for a day and a night. We stayed in a hotel, checked out a Christmas store, had some good food, etc. Our best lunch was at <a href="http://latitude29nola.com/" target="_blank">Latitude 29</a>, where the food and drinks were so good that if you picked up the whole place and dropped it into Des Moines, then suddenly Des Moines is a destination worth flying to for a weekend.</p><p>One thing they did with one of the cocktails is have the straw run through a block of ice shaped like a pestle (as in "mortar and..."). That was cool and all, until you let your kid stick it into his water, and then it melts into an ice cock and balls. So just keep that in mind when you visit.</p><p>After that, we went to the races, on a day that was decidedly different than the day when Peter, Paul, or Mary wrote, "Oh The Fairgrounds were crowded; and Stewball was there."</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/fairgroundswerentcrowded.jpg" data-lightview-caption="The Fairgrounds weren't at all crowded." data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/fairgroundswerentcrowded.jpg" alt="/img/fairgroundswerentcrowded.jpg" width="350px"><br><span class="caption">The Fairgrounds weren't at all crowded.</span></a><p>My mom showed up and looked for us, but somehow, she missed us in this massive crowd. She did notice a guy and a goofy red floppy hat, and just coincidentally, I was wearing a goofy red floppy hat, but she didn't look closely enough to determine that the guy in the goofy red floppy hat had (some four decades previously) sprung from her loins.</p><p>We closed out our night with a Cirque de Soliel/Louisiana Symphony combo at the Saenger, which I think we all enjoyed very much. I only mention it as an excuse to add this picture of Kolya, taking in the lobby of the grand theater for the first time. I'm compelled to add that I am very sober in this picture, despite appearances to the contrary.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/saenger.jpg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/saenger.jpg" alt="/img/saenger.jpg" height="350px"><br><span class="caption"></span></a><p>I've got more pics from this trip, which I'll post soon.

<li>Vanya's school had a Thanksgiving thing where we all go eat with the class.  V served himself a typical little kid lunch:  chicken nuggets, mashed potatoes, and a roll.  While he was eating, the mom who brought the potatoes stopped and asked him how he liked them.

"Terrible!" he replied.

"Well, they were made with love," she said.

That was a little embarrassing, but funny all the same.</li>
<li>Buffalo Bills player Sammy Watkins (formerly of Clemson) experienced his very first snow, with a monster storm up there in upstate New York.  <a href="https://twitter.com/sammywatkins" target="_blank">His twitter feed</a> has been like readking the reaction of a little kid.  It almost makes me think that it would be fun to be up there.  Check out <a href="http://instagram.com/p/vi6r7LI2_w/" target="_blank">this video</a>.</li>

<li>I tweeted this earlier today, so sorry if it's a repeat:  <a href="http://gizmodo.com/barbie-f-cks-it-up-again-1660326671">Barbie:  I Can Be a Computer Scientist</a>.  Even if you're already cringing, it's worse than you think.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li><a href="http://jezebel.com/we-are-all-this-glden-retriever-spectacularly-bombing-a-1660886189/+barryap" target="_blank">This goofy lab</a>, which you really must watch, even if you're tired of following links.</li>

<li>Kolya telling me, "I had a really, really big fart, and poo-poo came out."  Now we understand why grown-ups wear drawers.</li>

<li>This conversation with Vanya, about his birthday, to which he is counting down for the next three months:

"So how old will you be on your birthday?"

"I'm eight now, so... nine."

"Right."

"But, will I still be me?  Like, will I be the same boy?"

And then a couple of days later...

"I don't want to turn nine.  I want to stay little, so I can still sit in your lap."

<Sniff></li>

<li>Today, I mentioned how my mom likes to fry some boloney.  That led us to discussing the domed shape of fried boloney, and that in turn led us to referring to the building at work as the "boloney dome."</li>

Just as I was on my way out, Paul showed up and grabbed the door. I was home by myself, so I welcomed the excuse to ditch the kitchen cleanup and to sit out, smell the meat, and run our mouths.</p><p>First, I had to get the fire lit. I put the meat down and poured the charcoal. Then, I thought that I needed a water pan under the meat. The left side of the grill is an upright cold smoker, with a cabinet door that opens like a refrigerator. I popped it open, and as I was turning a way, a small rat poked his head out, like "Hello!"</p><p>Paul's girlie little scream caused me to do the same, and I slammed the door shut quickly.</p><p>I calmed my nerves and worked up some courage, then I opened the door again, and sprinted toward the house at approximately two hundred miles per hour.</p><p>No rat came out.</p><p>So I tiptoed back up to the box and looked in the door. I didn't see him. I crouched down low and looked up. He was perched on some sticks that were at the top, for hanging meat. I never knew those were there before! How cool.</p><p>I shut the door again, and lit the charcoal in the far away fire box. Paul crossed the back yard to the point as far from the smoker as it's possible to be, without having left the yard altogether. The smoke started wafting through the cooker, and I gave it a minute to get to the rat's side. I threw the door open and sprinted toward the house again.</p><p>What happened next will take me ten minutes to write. It will take you a minute or two to read. But it all happened in about one half of one second.</p><p>The rat jumped out of the smoker. Two grown men shrieked like females in distress in 1950s movies. EEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!</p><p>Before the rat hit the ground, Paul's scream switched to a cry of sheer terror. I was able to turn my head in time to see that he had put a foot on a stray dog turd, which had apparently felt much like an escaping rat underfoot. Immediately, his face went from fear to agony, as his terrified gyration aggravated the hip that he would soon have surgically replaced.</p><p>But before I could muster a laugh, I looked back for the rat. It was on the ground, and it was sprinting RIGHT FOR ME!</p><p>My pitch increased by an octave and got similarly louder. It was only about six feet away from me when it took a slight right, diving into the bushes and disappearing forever.</p><p>And now, this will be in your head all day anyway, so you might as well enjoy the video:</p><iframe width="600" height="450" src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com//www.youtube.com/embed/bS0fXQN6zrI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen class="centered"></iframe>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://theskinnyonbenny.com/blog2/abuse</guid><title>Disciplining Your Children</title><description>A description of my post.</description><link>https://theskinnyonbenny.com/blog2/abuse</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Sep 2014 11:34:00 -0400</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There's no one of my age -- at least no one whose family hails from the rural South -- who hasn't heard, "When I was bad, Daddy made me go outside and pick my own switch."</p><p>I always dismissed this as old person hyperbole. In my mind it belongs with, "I walked fourteen miles to school barefoot every day, and it was uphill in both directions."</p><p>I'm not really all that surprised to find out this week that there are terrible parents who break off a switch and beat their kids with it. A <em>four year old</em>? What the fuck?</p><p>And then, there's some debate as to whether this actually constitutes abuse. And that's where there's an interesting question. Make no mistake -- a toddler beaten until his legs and nutsack bled is an abused toddler. But it's fair to expect that for a variety of reasonable people, the punishment/abuse line can fall somewhere different.</p><p>When V was two, he was enrolled in a good elementary school's Pre-K3 program. Pre-K before Pre-K. The class had a discipline system where the kid came back every day having been a green fish (the apple polishers), yellow fish (moderately annoying brats), or a red fish (they were bad). V was usually a yellow fish, and often a red fish.</p><a class="lightview alignright" href="http://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/gal/049%20-%20Nov%20and%20Early%20Dec%202008/resIMG_5161.JPG" data-lightview-caption="Vanya in the Fall of 2008

</span></a><p>After the first few red fish, I decided that he had to go into his room by himself with the door closed any time that happened. So dutifully, I shut him up in there, and sat outside his room feeling terrible. He wailed through the door, "I'M SORRY PAPA! I WON'T DO IT AGAIN! I PROMISE I WON'T DO IT AGAIN." After a few minutes, I would let him out, but he was a wreck with tear-soaked cheeks, and those sort of quiverry exhales that kids get when they're trying to stop crying.</p><p>At the turn of the semester, his classmates started having birthday parties, and once we started talking to parents of the other kids in the class, we found out that almost every single kid came home with red fish several times a week. Every boy did for sure. And all of us thought we were raising hellions that would cause us no end of grief until they turned 30.<br><br>As I type, it's pissing me off all over again. I put him (and me) through that two or three times a week when he was just being a normal little boy. I'd like to stuff leaves in that teacher's mouth and beat her with a switch.</p><p>K's preschool is so much better. They're three now. The school has no color coded guide that parents are expected to act on. They say things like, "Three year olds are supposed to run and play and explore different things. That's how they learn." And, "We're trying to get them to stand in a line together." An on the games they play to learn letters and numbers, "We let them dictate what they're ready to do." I'm sure that seems a little hippy-dippy, but the results prove that they know how little kids learn.</p><p>I still use bedroom isolation as punishment for both of the kids, but not often. Like any good method, the threat of it is usually enough to stop the behavior. Yes, both of the kids act like it's the worst torture ever, but I guess that's how it should feel in the moment.<br><br>I can't forsee anything that would happen that would lead me to even spank one of them, but every parent <a href="http://deadspin.com/never-give-your-kid-a-cold-shower-advice-from-the-wors-512686828" target="_blank">loses his shit</a> once in a while. Go ahead and read that linked article.

I do not intend to supplement that enjoyment without the option of listening to some tunes. And I can't be expected to predict which 200 or which 2000 tunes I might want to hear, once I'm out there, so preloading them isn't the answer either.</p><p>Apple is going to charge me a monthly fee to stream my own music through the cloud. <span style="text-decoration:line-through">That's bullshit</span> -- no, that's BULLSHIT.</p><p>All is not lost.

That number is growing month by month, but at least I'm not counting on my iPod's full 160 GB capacity. My phone is using about 35 GB, which is at least half pictures and probably includes a good number of apps that I'd be all to happy to get rid of.

While I'm sure the celebrities that I've seen listed are quite famous, their names mostly mean nothing to me.</li><li>Aren't a lot of these naked pics of really young women?  I know eighteen is legal, but I'm of an age where looking at naked eighteen year old girls would rightly make me feel like a dirty old man.  It won't be long before the little girl children of my friends who I carried around as babies will be that old.  God help parents of daughters.</li></ul><p>With those excuses in mind, give yourself a treat by following <a href="http://deadspin.com/brett-favres-cellphone-seduction-of-jenn-sterger-upda-5658206">this link</a> to see Brett Favre's wiener.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://theskinnyonbenny.com/blog2/travel-log-gulf-coast-trip-part-2</guid><title>Travel Log â€“ Gulf Coast Trip Part 2</title><description>A description of my post.</description><link>https://theskinnyonbenny.com/blog2/travel-log-gulf-coast-trip-part-2</link><pubDate>Wed, 3 Sep 2014 21:16:00 -0400</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is the completion of our vacation story, which I first started <a href="http://theskinnyonbenny.com/blog2/archives/1813">way back when</a>. If you've forgotten all of that, go give it a quick look. I'll meet you back here.</p><em>Wednesday, June 18 - Thursday, June 19</em><p>When we last checked in with our intrepid voyagers on Velvet Elvis, they were at a nice little anchorage at about the spot where the civilized Florida coast dissappears for good. We left there between 5:00 and 6:00, knowing that our first all day-all night-all day sail was ahead of us.</p><a class="lightview alignright" href="http://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/gal/114%20-%202014%20Vacation%20-%20South%20Florida/resIMG_20140620_194006_2544.JPG" data-lightview-caption="Kids reunited at the St. Petersburg resort." data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="http://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/gal/114%20-%202014%20Vacation%20-%20South%20Florida/resIMG_20140620_194006_2544.JPG" alt="http://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/gal/114%20-%202014%20Vacation%20-%20South%20Florida/resIMG_20140620_194006_2544.JPG" width="350px"><br><span class="caption alignleft">Kids reunited at the St. Petersburg resort.</span></a><p>It turned out to be pretty uneventful. Winds were light and progress was slow, but there were no real mishaps. V continued to fight seasickness, but he slept all night in the cockpit. Then, he followed that by sleeping most of the day.</p><p>We had planned to go all the way to St. Petersburg, but with dusk approaching and us having still several hours to go, we found a calm anchorage outside of Tarpon Springs. The water was a beautiful deep turquoise, and the spot we found was deliciously free of other boats.</p><em>Friday, June 20</em><p>We started early again on Friday morning, and had a coastal sail of just a few hours. The wind was good early, and we didn't have to start the motor until we were out in front of the tourist boats and results of St. Petersburg. We motored the last little while, entering the bay though a long cut with light sandy shallow water on each side.<br><br>There was a little marina where we had planned to stay, a mile or so South of the resort where the Linkins would be staying. Once we checked it out though, we decided to refuel, and then motor up the bay and just anchor even closer. The marina really had nothing to offer.</p><a class="lightview alignright" href="http://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/gal/114%20-%202014%20Vacation%20-%20South%20Florida/resIMG_20140621_163936_2556.JPG" data-lightview-caption="Kolya dancing with a mermaid." data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="http://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/gal/114%20-%202014%20Vacation%20-%20South%20Florida/resIMG_20140621_163936_2556.JPG" alt="http://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/gal/114%20-%202014%20Vacation%20-%20South%20Florida/resIMG_20140621_163936_2556.JPG" width="200px"><br><span class="caption alignleft">Kolya dancing with a mermaid.</span></a><p>We found a pretty little anchorage, and to one end was a dock where sailboats take tourits out to see dolphins. They were nice enough to let us tie our dinghy there while we walked up to the resorts to play. There were also groceries and a drugstore right there, so it was most convenient.</p><p>We made our way to the resort, ordered lunch, and found the Linkins. A nice concierge heard my story and gave me passes to use the pools and amenities.</p><p>As is usual for a beach trip, the stories are best told by the pictures, so be sure to <a href="http://theskinnyonbenny.com/pg4.php?spgmGal=114%20-%202014%20Vacation%20-%20South%20Florida">check those out</a>.</p><em>Saturday, June 21</em><p>Saturday was a pretty normal, lazy beach and pool day. Late afternoon, we went in to get ready to walk down to dinner, and Kolya treated us to an energetic dance with an inflatible mermaid. Mrs. theskinnyonbenny changed clothes in a closet, and Vanya crushed hard on a girl who will consider him much too young until he is 22 and she is 27.</p><p>Mrs. theskinnyonbenny had a beachfront restaurant in mind a mile or so down the beach, and walking down in the early evening gave us the opportunity to pass behind a couple of weddings. I wanted to be disruptive without being obnoxious or vulgar, so I settled on passing behind the wedding trellis while walking like an Egyption. I was most pleased to have V and Jake join me.</p><p>We drank and laughed through dinner, and then we walked past our part of the resort to a different building where they were having some sort of "party." It was really just a pool and a big outside bar that was open, along with a lot of communal seating. We sat around and made friends with strangers while the kids did their own thing, and then we called it a night.</p><em>Sunday, June 22</em><a class="lightview alignright" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/gal/114%2520-%25202014%2520Vacation%2520-%2520South%2520Florida/resIMG_20140621_190542_2614.JPG" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/gal/114%2520-%25202014%2520Vacation%2520-%2520South%2520Florida/resIMG_20140621_190542_2614.JPG" alt="/img/gal/114%20-%202014%20Vacation%20-%20South%20Florida/resIMG_20140621_190542_2614.JPG" width="350px"><br><span class="caption alignleft"></span></a><p>Another beach/pool/bar day. The only noteworthy event I can remember is this: Crystal was lying around a cabana, not moving, but mentioning every 20 minutes or so that we should feed the kids lunch. Mrs. theskinnyonbenny finally got annoyed and walked up to buy sandwhiches and pizza. She returned a long while later, and food was distributed to all of the young beggars.</p><p>I was trying to fall asleep, but I couldn't do with with all of the commotion. I finally sat up and accepted a piece of pizza. Then, while looking to my side in conversation, a damned seagull swooped down, pecked me in the hand, and flew off with my pizza.<br><br>After that, Kolya would charge the birds screaming loudly as they came near, but they seemed almost as big as he was. No doubt that they were planning to team up and eat the little brown kid.</p><p>This episode was still playing out in my mind some weeks later:</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>As far as I&#39;m concerned, all insects and seagulls can go fuck themselves.</p>&mdash; Ben Schultz (@bens4lsu) <a href="https://twitter.com/bens4lsu/statuses/494176063228878848">July 29, 2014</a></blockquote><script async src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script><p>Later, the whole crew came out to Velvet Elvis, and we motored around to Downtown St. Petersburg. We got down there around dark and had dinner overlooking the marina.</p><em>Monday, June 23</em><p>The next day, I spent the a lot of the day at the marina with some work and some boat maintenance. I got out to the resort and to the beach. I walked down to the place we had eaten the previous night and enjoyed some cocktail time all by myself. It was a much-needed respite.</p><p>That night, we hit a restaurant down the beach that had this giant aquarium built by the reality show crew. It was sort of cool. Then, we played outside in the dark, knowing that this was the last time we would see our friends for many months.</p><em>Tuesday, June 24</em><a class="lightview alignright" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/gal/114%2520-%25202014%2520Vacation%2520-%2520South%2520Florida/resIMG_20140624_093010_2793.JPG" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/gal/114%2520-%25202014%2520Vacation%2520-%2520South%2520Florida/resIMG_20140624_093010_2793.JPG" alt="/img/gal/114%20-%202014%20Vacation%20-%20South%20Florida/resIMG_20140624_093010_2793.JPG" width="200px"><br><span class="caption alignleft"></span></a><p>Tuesday was our day long Disney World marathon. The plan was to get up early, drive there in time to open the park, let K meet Mickey Mouse and maybe one of the princesses from Frozen, ride some rides, and get back home.</p><p>Of that, we got up early, and we rode some rides.</p><p>I don't want to be too negative, but even getting there soon after the park opened, it was crowded and hot enough to swampify the crotch of the shorts. There were definitely some fun moments, especially for the kids, but I have no idea how people spend day after day out there.</p><p>At the end of our long, tiring day, we drove back out to the marina and rested up.</p><em>Wednesday, June 25 - Sunday, June 29</em><p>My dad came down Wednesday afternoon, and shortly after he arrived, we shoved off and headed West. By sunset, we were out of sight of land. We worked night shifts of three hours on, six hours off, and it really couldn't have been easier. For the first two days, wind was light to nonexistent, and we had to motor a lot. But after that, it filled in just as forecast. By Saturday night, we were flying along at breakneck pace.</p><p>We saw lots of little flying fish and a huge pod of dolphins. The dolphins darted all around, and the water was clear enough to let us watch them zig and zag under water.</p><p>I also had one night where the boat was rising up gently and settling back down into its bow wave. As it sunk down, it would throw a gentle wave of water off to the side, and that water would light up with bio-luminescent plankton. Really cool stuff.</p><p>There was lots of reading, lots of sweat, and one epic water gun fight in the middle of the Gulf of Mexico.<br><br>We made it home Sunday morning and spent the rest of the day cleaning up and getting ourselves back to Baton Rouge.</p><p>We ate frozen and boxed prepped foods, and out there, they were good.<br><br><em>In case you were skimming, the whole photo gallery is <a href="http://theskinnyonbenny.com/pg4.php?spgmGal=114%20-%202014%20Vacation%20-%20South%20Florida">here</a>.

Then, in a scene right out of a cartoon movie, and army of dragonflies showed up and ran them off.

</span></a><p>I had been feeling pretty good about my boat handling skills, and I pulled up to the fuel dock like a pro. But then when we tried to take our slip, I fucked it up as badly as anyone really can. We didn't sink, so there's that. Perhaps it will be a funny tale one day with the passage of time, but for now, I'll leave it untold.</p><p>We had a pretty good dinner at a restaurant overlooking the marina. Kolya experienced something similar to falling in love when he tried the twice-fried fries that they were serving.</p><p>After that, I took a walk to pick up Dramamine -- an egregious oversight from our onboard first aid kit. Our marina was in an area that they apparently refer to as "downtown", but it isn't the business district with the tall buildings that any other city would call downtown. This was the original and oldest part of the city, and it was full of cool streets with old buildings turned into shops and restaurants.<br><br>I passed two wedding receptions, which I thought odd on a Sunday night. One looked to be a classy affair. I passed just as the young couple was cutting the cake. The bride smeared some on her husband's nose, and his facial expression said, "I can't believe how cute she is!" Bleh.</p><p>The second wedding was more of a redneck affair. Most of the people were well dressed, but there was the guy who just put on his "formal" coboy hat. Kids dragged each other by their legs across the dance floor while country music blared. To top it off, a bridesmaid stood outside drunk and bawling around the corner from the front door.</p><p>I'm very perceptive while I walk.</p><p>The cool part of town ends suddenly, and there's just the crappiest city in the world right beyond that. I ducked into the first convenience store, make my buy, and got back to the boat.</p><em>Monday, June 16</em><p>We're getting good at living aboard, After leaving without incident, Mrs. theskinnyonbenny manned the helm, while I made eggs, hash browns, and coffee for everyone. Breakfast was served just as we pulled out of the bay into the flattest, glassiest ocean that I've ever seen. We got everyone dressed, teeth brushed, and settled into a couple of hours of motoring toward Destin. V and Mrs. theskinnyonbenny are taking a nap, and K is using the iPad to draw pictures. I've been able to get some work done and to update this text file.

</span></a><p>We spent the evening and night in Destin Harbor, a good anchorage that is packed full of fishing charters, rentals, vacationers on jet skis, etc. Had a good meal at one of the tourist traps on the water, then dinghyed over to the sand peninsula that protects the harbor and checked out wildlife. We went back over there again after dark to look for crabs. The kids caught a few hermit crabs, but we didn't see any biggies in the water.</p><p>That was a fun afternoon. V spent a lot of time figuring out the nuances of the motor. He's becoming a real seaman on this trip. Since our docking mishap, he's asking about affects of the wind on the boat. He's watching for other boats and taking care to avoid them by great margins. I'm proud of him.</p><em>Tuesday, June 17</em><p>It occurs to me that it might be hard to figure out what we're doing during the day. There isn't really much to it.</p><p>We've been getting up at 5:00, stowing gear, and getting underway by 6:00. We sail or motor or motor-sail for a while. Kids wake up after an hour or two and appear sleepy-eyed. I usually fix them breakfast, and then we all go up in the cockpit and watch the Florida coast slide by for many hours. We read, listen to music, take naps, and just do our thing.</p><a class="lightview alignright" href="http://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/gal/113%20-%202014%20Vacation%20-%20Northern%20Gulf%20Coast/resIMG_20140617_164110_1135.JPG" data-lightview-caption="All set for that storm on the horizon.

When they're bright and cheerful, it's hard not to be the same, and when they're tired and whiny, the innate fatigue and whininess can be drawn out of any of us.</p><p>We had an easy sail today to an anchorage behind St. Joseph island (or is it a peninsula?) to the west of Appilachicola. It couldn't be any nicer. We anchored in clear, aqua colored water and dinghyed over to a deserted pristine beach lousy with wildlife. I need to get a book of sea life to help me identify all of the things we saw. There were a couple of other boats anchored together far away, but we didn't see or hear a soul.</p><p>(I was going to stick the video in about here, but the pictures have this post all cluttered up. I'll tack it on to the end of the post.)</p><p>At dark, we came back to the boat for hot dogs and noodles, followed by movie night on the laptop. Our early mornings have meant that we don't spend much time after dark sitting up on deck and exercising our livers until the small hours. We'll have to setp that up over the end of the trip.</p><em>Wednesday, June 18</em><p>Well, I guess I'm not going to get this posted promptly, as I haven't done it yet, and now we're out in the ocean without service. You wouldn't believe how flat and calm it can be out here. Motoring most of the day, as there's almost no wind, and what wind there is is right on our bow. We saw a few more dolphins and some flying fish. Nothing else really exciting to report for now.</p><p>Our generator shut itself off last night with a warning about raw water intake. It wouldn't be a big deal, except that the boat is still new, and I'm not 100% sure where its raw water strainer is. While I'm searching, I need to find a piece of electronics that cotrols our AIS signal and get it configured. Right now, we show up on our plotter as "0". I found the sofware that does the configuration, but not the haradware that needs to be configured.</p><a class="lightview alignright" href="http://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/gal/113%20-%202014%20Vacation%20-%20Northern%20Gulf%20Coast/resIMG_20140617_184834_2528.JPG" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="http://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/gal/113%20-%202014%20Vacation%20-%20Northern%20Gulf%20Coast/resIMG_20140617_184834_2528.JPG" alt="http://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/gal/113%20-%202014%20Vacation%20-%20Northern%20Gulf%20Coast/resIMG_20140617_184834_2528.JPG" width="350px"><br><span class="caption alignright"></span></a><p>On a more pressing boat note, the vacuum that sucks the nasty bits out of the head has given up on its very short life. Out here, I can pump it overboard instead of having it sucked into a tank, but it's a cumbersome process, and I'd like to just let everyone flush away their own "black water," as the manual calls it.</p><p>I've just about finished reading <i>All Fishermen Are Liars</i>, by John Gierach. I like fly fishing a lot, even though I never actually participate in it. If we were just drifting along slowly, I'd throw a line over to see if we could get anything. I'd call it a must-read if you like fly fishing. A should-read if you just like outdoorsy stories in general.</p><p>This passage is expected to last through the night. We're planning to do three-hour watches. I'm really hoping for watches under sail instead of with this wretched motor noise.</p><em>...but I need more!</em><p>Lots more pictures from these days are <a href="http://theskinnyonbenny.com/pg4.php?spgmGal=113%20-%202014%20Vacation%20-%20Northern%20Gulf%20Coast">over here</a>.</p><p>I'll do another post to finish out the trip one day soon.</p><iframe src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com//player.vimeo.com/video/99697885" width="500" height="375" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style="display:block;clear:both; margin-top:30px; margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;width:500px;"></iframe>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://theskinnyonbenny.com/blog2/a-matter-of-perspective</guid><title>A Matter of Perspective</title><description>A description of my post.</description><link>https://theskinnyonbenny.com/blog2/a-matter-of-perspective</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 May 2014 14:38:00 -0400</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I'm not sure what made me think of it today, but several years ago, a group of us went into a rather nice restaurant.

Had we taken my car instead of Mrs. theskinnyonbenny's, we would have been tuned to a different station. Had we not turned back to make sure she didn't leave the hair press on, I might have been flipping channels.</p><p>(I don't know the name of the device, but it's like a set of electrically hot tongs that prettify the female hair in some way or other.)</p><p>Ultimately, I find myself driving down Acadian Thruway, listening to Floyd Cramer, and trying not to laugh. Part of me wants to laugh because I'm thinking of the lewd Floyd Cramer jokes that I used to make back when this commercial ran all day every day. But I'm suppressing the laugh, because I know that Mrs. theskinnyonbenny will be thinking, "Are you fucking kidding me? He's laughing about Floyd Cramer penis jokes that weren't funny when he made them 20 years ago?"</p><p>That might be the only drawback of marrying the person you were dating when you were nineteen. You can't just brush off an old laugh with, "Well, you really had to have been there." She actually was there.</p><p>After the song, the radio host explained that ol' Floyd started out with Louisiana Hayride, and that he was the session pianist for most of Elvis's hits along with tons of other rock and country acts back in the day.

I was channel flipping last night, and one station had clips from last year's Jazz Fest. I stuck around for a few songs, and they flipped to the end of Trombone Shorty's set that closed it out last year. I called the kids in there to look for themselves, even though we were so far back when he played that our images had to have been reduced to a mere pixel or two even on the rare occasions that the camera zoomed out far enough to see the approximiate location where we sat.</p><a class="lightview alignright" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/resIMG_20140426_125610_2081.JPG" data-lightview-caption="Professional festival-goer." data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/resIMG_20140426_125610_2081.JPG" alt="/img/resIMG_20140426_125610_2081.JPG" width="350px"><br><span class="caption alignleft">Professional festival-goer.</span></a><p>About the part where Shorty got the zillion people jumping up and down, Kolya got fired up.

We kill one another at a rate of more than one million per year, mostly wartime casualties. The second-deadliest threat is snakes, which kill over 100,000 people annually, followed by crocodiles (960), and tigers (740). The much-feared shark falls far down the listâ€”only about seven human victims annually worldwideâ€”making it a lightweight compared to the ostrich, which when cornered can kick viciously with hammerlike feet and sharp talons and kills some 14 people every year. As for the ferocious grizzly bear, it ranks about the same as mustelids (weasels, badgers, skunks, and the like), which kill an average of four humans a year, primarily pet ferrets attacking unattended babies. A couple more reassuring statistics: In the United States and Canada, you have more to fear from moose (six deaths per year) than any other creature except snakes (12). And the most likely place in the States to be attacked by an alligator (three deaths between 1992 and 1998) is not deep in some swamp, but on a golf course.</blockquote><p>And then on snakes,</p><blockquote>Snakes kill far more humans worldwide than any other animal, but as one authority states, they "have never been shown to attack without provocation, despite lengthy historical commentary to the contrary." ...In the United States, by contrast, many victims are under the influence of alcohol or drugs and, in the words of another expert, are "messing with" the snakes. Researchers in Alabama have noted a statistical drop in venomous snakebites among adult men when University of Alabama or Auburn University football games are televised...</blockquote><p>And I haven't even gotten to the topic of the article -- the box jellyfish.</p><p>Go ahead, go read it.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://theskinnyonbenny.com/blog2/hey</guid><title>Hey</title><description>A description of my post.</description><link>https://theskinnyonbenny.com/blog2/hey</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Mar 2014 16:12:00 -0400</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This morning, K woke up with a loud, "HEY!"</p><p>Scared the shit out of me, even though I was already awake.</p><p>Before I reacted, he continued.</p><p>"WHO MESSED WITH MY PANKAKES?"</p><p>"You were dreaming little dude.

Itâ€™s all over the map â€“ from the quiet, dress-shirt wearing professional building to the noisy, jeans and t-shirt wearing software shops. This month, I started a new thing at one of the quiet, professional type places.</p><table cellpadding="2" align="right"><tr><td width="5" rowspan="2"><spacer type="block" width="5" height="1"></td><td width="250" ><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/doorwindow.jpg"></td></tr><tr><td class="caption" width="250">The door-window.  I didn't have the nerve to take the picture from an angle where the woman who sits through there can see me.</td></tr></table><p>The building is a typical office building, with an elevator lobby that has doors to two or three different companies. The restrooms are also from a door in the lobby, and on my floor, the menâ€™s room is a nightmare. There are two stalls and a urinal, crammed together along one wall. One is a handicap stall, but the other is tight enough to bump each elbow on each side. If I were 25 lbs heavier, I wouldnâ€™t be able to fit back there to the urinal at all.</p><p>What makes it all the worse is that these three holes serve a whole office floor of men. At first, I was never, never, never alone in there. Iâ€™m hearing other people make the worst sounds in the world just inches away from me, while they hear me do the same.</p><p>Then, I discovered that the floor above mine is much more scarcely populated. Itâ€™s been recently renovated. There are still paint patches on the walls, and the air still smells like new carpet. Best of all, the menâ€™s room was always empty.</p><p>Itâ€™s true that everything is a tradeoff. I found my empty menâ€™s room, but at the cost of having the lady behind this door give me the stink-eye every day. I appear in her window from her right â€“ where the only door is the one to the stairwell, and then she sees me walk away from her and into the menâ€™s room. Then, weâ€™re face-to-face through her door window as I walk back.<br><br>Her expression is always far from friendly.</p><p>Yesterday, as I was coming out, in came the guy who sits at the desk next to me one floor below. His face (and Iâ€™m sure mine too) was priceless â€“ the shock of being discovered dashing in for an illicit poo.</p>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
