I can shrug off a lot that should be embarrassing with a "Well, that happens to everyone sometimes," or "Funny way to learn a lesson."

In one case, we see something strange, and in one case, we see something brilliant.

When we have charter guests, they're almost always very nice. These people were good enough that Poseidon blessed them with just about perfect weather. The wind was good enough to push the boat along at a fun little clip while being weak enough to avoid dumping the sandwich tray into anyone's lap.</p><p>While I was prepping the boat, I saw some racers come in from the lake wearing full foul weather gear. It made me worry. The dock was mid-70s and sunny, with a gentle breeze. Could it be that much colder, windier, or wetter out on the lake? I hadn't even told our guests to bring jackets.</p><p>We went up to the bar before the guests arrived to check in with college football scores and to lubricate the "social interaction with strangers" circuits of the brain. I saw one of the racers up there, still wearing his life jacket while walking around the bar area. And it wasn't an unintrusive little harness that would inflate if he went overboard; it was a big bulky puffy lifejacket just like the ones you wore as a kid.</p><p>Like I mentioned, sunset over the lake was quite nice, so the foul-weather, life-jacket wearing crew might just have been a little bit nutty.</p><p>Even though it was a pretty night, I didn't take a single picture that evening. So enjoy this picture of an Irish coffee that I got at Beausoleil.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/irishcoffee.jpg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/irishcoffee.jpg" alt="/img/irishcoffee.jpg"><br><span class="caption"></span></a><p>Beautiful, isn't it? It tasted even better. That top layer started its night as cream, and the bartender put it in a shaker with a little wire mesh thing. After a good shake, it flopped out as a thick whipped cream, slightly sweet, and extremely tasty.</p><p>We had gone in to the restaurant on Halloween night, which you might recall was on Friday. Ko was at a party in a nearby neighborhood, so we went to the bar to kill time before having to Puber (parent uber) him <s>home</s> to his next party.</p><p>It had to have been the only 9:00PM Friday in their history with no customers at all. Mrs. theskinnyonbenny and I were the only ones there. It was odd, but the staff was friendly, the World Series was on (I was strangely hooked this year), and as you might have heard, the drinks were good.</p><p>I'm craving another Irish coffee now.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://theskinnyonbenny.com/blog2/from-tigerland-to-dad-bod-land</guid><title>From Tigerland to Dad Bod Land</title><description>The past week and change has heavily featured catching up with friends that we don't see that often.

We were excited to go out there and help our friends from <a href="" target="_blank">Pegasus Yachts</a> show off their boat for Americans for the first time.</p><p>It was surprising to me that a lot of Americans had seen magazine writeups. Lots of the people who came aboard recognized Miha from the videos on their web site.</p><a class="lightview alignright" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/boat-show-2025-1.jpeg" data-lightview-caption="Annapolis from the air on boat show Thursday" data-lightview-group="group1" ><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/boat-show-2025-1.jpeg" alt="/img/boat-show-2025-1.jpeg"><br><span class="caption">Annapolis from the air on boat show Thursday</span></a><p>We flew in Thursday, and right as we landed, I got a text excitedly telling us that Pegasus was showing. It wasn't from a number that I had in my phone, but the intersection of people who had a Tampa area code and who would also be at the boat show gave me 90% confidence that it was our friends Ben and/or Francine. Ben bought the Beneteau Velvet Elvis from us and was great to hang out with during that process. He and Francine came to New Orleans and went sailing with me back in the Spring.</p><p>I allowed for a slight chance that it was Leo -- the broker who sold us the Beneteau Velvet Elvis. I'm just noticing the symmetry there. In an hour, we were walking over to meet the mystery friends, and I was going to be pretty disappointed if it turned out to be Leo. Fortunately, it was Ben and Francine.</p><p>We got to catch up for a little while before Mrs. theskinnyonbenny and I had to go meet the Pegasus team for dinner. We ate, and they were beat from a day of boat showing, so we crossed the street to go to a dive bar full of boat vendors, which is exactly as awesome as it sounds.</p><a class="lightview alignright" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/boat-show-2025-2.jpeg" data-lightview-caption="Dive bar full of boat people." data-lightview-group="group1" ><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/boat-show-2025-2.jpeg" alt="/img/boat-show-2025-2.jpeg"><br><span class="caption">Dive bar full of boat people.</span></a><p>On Friday, we went to the show. I spent most of the day answering questions for boat shoppers and listening to them tell me how awesome my boat is. I enjoyed it so much that I didn't even take a break to eat. Ben and Francine were beat after their day at the show (there <em>is</em> a lot of walking), so an even bigger group of Pegasus people went to a wine bar, found they had crab to eat, and ended up staying a while.</p><p>Once the grown ups went home that night, Mrs. theskinnyonbenny and I went to another bar for a nightcap, and we met Béeri, a graduate student from Haiti at a small college in Annapolis that neither you nor I have ever heard of. We talked islands and rum, and now he's a good friend. I just got a text from him as I'm typing this.</p><p>Saturday was more of the same from the show, but I also found time to sneak off and visit the vendor booth for some of our boat parts. I wanted to have business cards of people I can call directly when shit breaks and I can't get answers through normal customer service.</p><a class="lightview alignright" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/boat-show-2025-3.jpeg" data-lightview-caption="Killer food at the Annapolis Yacht Club." data-lightview-group="group1" ><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/boat-show-2025-3.jpeg" alt="/img/boat-show-2025-3.jpeg"><br><span class="caption">Killer food at the Annapolis Yacht Club.</span></a><p>There is a yacht club right by the boat show, so as the crowds thinned and it got colder Saturday night, Mrs. theskinnyonbenny and I walked over there to see what was happening in college football. Staff and members were very nice, and their menu was <strong></strong>.<br><br>The yact club bartender gave us the lowdown on where to get the best crab cakes. It was a place I remember being before, but I have no idea when.<br><br> I would have texted everyone to meet us there, except I'm a dumbass and I mixed up some numbers. I flipped Ben's number -- which I still hadn't entered with a name -- with Béeri's. I should have figured it out when the reply came back begging off until later due to homework. I know we talked about Ben being recently retired. But I just shrugged it off, figuring he encountered some products at the boat show that he wanted to read up on. It was a surprise when Béeri showed up for dinner, with a gift of Hatian rum for me to bring home. A pleasant one, but it still took me a while to figure out that I had been texting him and not Ben. I really am not very smart. This is the third time that I've been to the Annapolis Boat show, and it's been a lot of fun every time. I didn't get that many pictures, but here are a bunch more.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/boat-show-2025-4.JPG" data-lightview-caption=" On our way out" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/boat-show-2025-4.JPG" alt="/img/boat-show-2025-4.JPG"><br><span class="caption"> On our way out</span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/boat-show-2025-5.jpeg" data-lightview-caption="I love a walkable town on a cool fall morning." data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/boat-show-2025-5.jpeg" alt="/img/boat-show-2025-5.jpeg"><br><span class="caption">I love a walkable town on a cool fall morning.</span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/boat-show-2025-6.jpeg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/boat-show-2025-6.jpeg" alt="/img/boat-show-2025-6.jpeg"><br><span class="caption"></span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/boat-show-2025-7.jpeg" data-lightview-caption="Show Pegasus" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/boat-show-2025-7.jpeg" alt="/img/boat-show-2025-7.jpeg"><br><span class="caption">Show Pegasus</span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/boat-show-2025-8.jpeg" data-lightview-caption="I kind of want to add one of these to my fleet." data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/boat-show-2025-8.jpeg" alt="/img/boat-show-2025-8.jpeg"><br><span class="caption">I kind of want to add one of these to my fleet.</span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/boat-show-2025-9.jpeg" data-lightview-caption="The Ridiculously large Swan 70.

I got myself in there early so I would get my share of the coffee, and I would have time to poo before the presentation started.

It's known for one food or type of food, and that item is great. But then they pay such scant attention to the rest of their menu that if you go off-specialty, it kind of sucks.</p><p>I had a birthday last week. Thank you very much for the well wishes.</p><p>I had a hunger for ribs, so we went to TJ's, where I devoured an order while the rest of the family complained about the off-specialty food that they ordered. As I stared down into my sad little plate full of bones, I thought about how to make them myself.</p><a class="lightview alignright" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/ribs1.jpg" data-lightview-caption="Kitchen prep" data-lightview-group="group1" ><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/ribs1.jpg" alt="/img/ribs1.jpg"><br><span class="caption">Kitchen prep</span></a><p>So Friday afternoon, I went and asked for three racks of ribs, thinking that the "full rack" on my birthday order would correspond to the meat market's full rack. It did not. I got 2 to 3 times as much as I had wanted.</p><p>I cooked them up perfectly. It was hard to take them off the fire because the meat was sliding off of the bones.</p><p>While I was at it, I decided to make my own barbecue sauce. I've done that before, and it's not too hard. You just have to get past the part of your brain that's saying, "There's no way that they put <em>that</em> much sugar in this stuff."</p><p>Tomato sauce base, plus enough molassas and brown sugar to kill a horse. Then, half to three quarters of a cup of vinegar for a little bite, and a healthy hump of salt. All that's left is adding a little heat.</p><a class="lightview alignright" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/icantfeelmyface.jpg" data-lightview-caption="I Can't Feel My Face" data-lightview-group="group1" ><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/icantfeelmyface.jpg" alt="/img/icantfeelmyface.jpg"><br><span class="caption">I Can't Feel My Face</span></a><p>We have a collection of <a href="https://www.flatironpepper.com" target="_blank">crushed pepper flakes</a>, in a number of varieties.

I like spice, but this is <strong>way</strong> too hot to sprinkle on your Dominos order.</p><p>I thought a little bit might go a long way in my sauce. To about a half gallon of sauce, I added approxomately a teaspoon.</p><p>The result didn't send me running for milk, but one little spoonfull of the spiced barbecue sauce was enough for a runny nose and complaining about burning lips a half hour later. Mrs. theskinnyonbenny and I could have handled it, but it was too hot to serve others, and we had so many ribs that serving others was obligatory.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/ribs2.jpg" data-lightview-caption="Final Glaze" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/ribs2.jpg" alt="/img/ribs2.jpg"><br><span class="caption">Final Glaze</span></a><p>I ended up making a blander batch, which was a little too salty, but the misture of the two was just right.</p><p>You know how annoying it is when you search up a recipe and then there's this whole boring narrative in front of the actual recipe?

<b>Recipe</b>
<ol>
<li>  Coat the ribs with a dry rub of salt, pepper, paprika, and garlic powder.</li>
<li>  With a mixutre of coal and wood in the fire box, get the grill temp up between 200 and 250.</li>
<li>  Throw the ribs on, and keep the temperature in that range for an hour and 45 minutes.</li>
<li>  Pull the ribs off, put a trail of barbecue sauce down the middle of a piece of aluminum foil, and put the rack meat-side-down on the foil.  Wrap the rack in foil.</li>
<li>  Put the wrapped rack meat-side-down on the fire for another hour and a half.</li>
<li>  Use the meat thermoneter and start checking the temp between bones.  We want the inside temp at 205.</li>
<li>  Pull the ribs off, throw away the foil, and let them cool for a half hour.</li>
<li>  Glaze the meat with sauce and put back on the grill for 15 minutes.

But it's still my every day vehicle, and it has been the shittiest one of them all.</p><p>It's in the shop yet again. The current issue is that the screen between the speedometer and tachometer is fried. As I hinted about earlier, this is the screen that shows warning lights. It's also got a clock, the compass heading, info about the current gear, and several other unimportant bits of information. Mostly, I'm fine without it.</p><p>But it would be nice to have a fuel guage.</p><p>Several months back, I ran out of gas.

You see, this little piece of electronics also contains the odometer. So to get it fixed, I have to bring it in, have them measure the mileage, and send it off in an order to Jeep. Then, Jeep has to make a new circuit board with that odometer reading burnt in as the starting number and send it back. But if I drive it off, they have to start the process over from the beginning.</p><p>Hopefully all of this wraps up in time to enjoy some of the glorious weather.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://theskinnyonbenny.com/vid/interesting-unusual-and-funny</guid><title>Interesting, Unusual, and Funny</title><description></description><link>https://theskinnyonbenny.com/vid/interesting-unusual-and-funny</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Sep 2025 17:11:14 -0500</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://theskinnyonbenny.com/vid/family-home-videos</guid><title>Family Home Videos</title><description></description><link>https://theskinnyonbenny.com/vid/family-home-videos</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Sep 2025 17:11:14 -0500</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://theskinnyonbenny.com/blog2/vegas-weekend</guid><title>Vegas Weekend</title><description>Last month, several of us met up in Vegas to celebrate Camilla's 21st birthday.

Mrs. theskinnyonbenny's inner kick-ass captain took over, and she found a place to dock and a ride to the hospital while handling all of the boat piloting solo.</p><p>There's much of that trip that my brain has lost, but I won't soon forget her docking. She was at the wheel, looking over her shoulder, screaming at the dock hands, "I'VE NEVER DONE THIS BEFORE," while backig perfectly into a slip meant for a mega-yacht.</p><p>Within a few hours, the hospital had knocked my fever down and given me a strong dose of IV antibiotics. My brain fog cleared over the course of a night in the ER, and in the morning, I was moved to an actual hospital room.</p><p>Shout out to Dr Dionne Dames, who was so amazing and kind that I'm thinking of flying to Nassau any time I feel under the weather.</p><p>It seemed much longer, but four days later, I got my release.

The Pegasus really reduces the time spent between islands, so we were able to go somewhere cool every day. Here's a quick recap, in case you're planning your own trip.</p><p>Norman's Cay: A couple of cool tropical bars/restaurants. Seatings were booked up, but we got to have cocktails.

We didn't get the bright sun that makes it look almost fake, but we motored up mangrove-lind streams and spotted sharks and a sea turtle. Ending on the other side, we had clear water and a beach to ourselves.</p><p>O'Brien's Cay: There's a great snorkeling spot, with tons and tons of fish and coral, and then right around a corner is a perfect sand bar, where you can stand there like it's a two-acre swimming pool. Bring an ice chest full of beer and spend half a day there.</p><p>Staniel Cay: The original beach for swimming with pigs, Thunderball Grotto (another of my favorite places), and Staniel Cay yacht club.</p><p>When we were at SCYC in 2021, we met a lady who just happened to live near Crystal, and her son. They were fun, and we hung out for a couple of days. And would you believe that they were there again?

I was on the toilet.</p><p>This is last Saturday. Crystal and Camilla were at the house for a short visit, and I had finished my business. We have the toilet seat add on bidets installed, so I turned the knob to give my butthole a good rinse. Once satisfied, I turned it back, but instead of shutting off the water, the knob came off in my hand.</p><p>I reached down for the toilet's water shut off, but it was just out of reach.</p><p>I went ahead and flushed, and then I called for Mrs. theskinnyonbenny.

By the time he got in and to the shutoff valve, it was even longer. And then the knob turned, but the water didn't shut off. It was just slipping around the nut without actually turning the valve inside the pipe. So my butthole flush continued.</p><p>I finally decided that I needed to get up. I had Ko move the hamper out of the immediate area, as things other than my backside were about to get really wet. I darted as quickly as I could, and the spray arched out of the bowl and hit the tile wall across from the toilet.</p><p>And then I couldn't find any pliers that would turn the bidet knob. V was home, and he had something in his car that worked well. But meanwhile, a geyser spewed forth from the toilet bowl onto the wall.</p><p>I joked that if there's anyone that ever wanted to do butt stuff with me, it would be a good day to give it a try.<br><br>Previously, the cleanest my anus ever got was when I could foul a hotel washcloth and get up in there in a manner that I would never do with my own.

I translated it in my mind and communicated to Clay that it was at "some place that teenage girls go to ride horses." The Jefferson Highway address made me think that it was way out in the sticks, but it was at the Witter place -- a big farm right in the middle of Baton Rouge's most prime real estate. Clay's back yard borders it, and it's just a few minutes away for me.</p><p>That place has always been mysterious to me, and I was looking forward to going up into the grounds to explore.</p><p>We drove up a long windy driveway, through pretty grounds.

I'm sure there's a real word for that, but I'm not sure what it is. Next to the arena was a big stable house, with brick flooring and a chandelier.

This year, we were watching Don Vappie, and he was pretty entertaining. Double winner.</p><p>From there, we went to the cajun stage and watched the Lemon Spots, who were also a lot of fun. This stage is great, but it's on a huge hot asphalt lot. If they would just cover the whole lot in straw or something, it would be 15 degrees more comfortable out there. While here, we got a killer chicken sandwich.<br><br>I saw some turkey legs that were gigantic, roasted and smokey smelling. They had been split along the bone and filled with shrimp in some sort of creamy sauce. It was enough food for a giant, and has to be the best deal at the festival.</p><p>Bunch of pics...</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/IMG_4896.jpeg" data-lightview-caption="The pink full moon or whatever it was from Friday night.

They also sent her one with a threat to charge $200 for a pressure wash of a simple little brick wall.</p><p><em>This</em> is a neighborhood in need of some teenagers breaking car windows to steal change, phone chargers, and Creedance casette tapes.</p><h4>Exhibit 2</h4><p>Earlier in the week, <a href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/blog2/birthday-party/">I used this space to talk about my nephew’s birthday party</a>.

Neither was LSU, but I've gone from LSU baseball fan to general college baseball fan, and I'm watching games just to see how good teams are, just like I would watch a Bills/Ravens Monday night game in October.</p><a class="lightview alignright" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/2baseballgames.jpg" data-lightview-caption="Starting the night at the ballparks." data-lightview-group="group1" ><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/2baseballgames.jpg" alt="/img/2baseballgames.jpg"><br><span class="caption">Starting the night at the ballparks.</span></a><p>But I wasn't so in to it that I wasn't going to flip to Apple TV and watch the Season 2 finale of Severance. But I've also been a huge huge fan of The Pitt, and I saw a post from a TV reviewer saying that that night's episode was the best of them all. I messaged him to ask what I should watch first.</p><p>Seriously, quit now. There's a shocking twist 2/3 of the way through Season 1, and I'm going to spoil it.</p><p>(I did not include the Alabama/Tennessee baseball game in my list of what to watch, because I don't want this internet stranger to think I am insane.)</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/IMG_4850.jpeg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/IMG_4850.jpeg" alt="/img/IMG_4850.jpeg"><br><span class="caption"></span></a><p>So at 8:00, I went in to the house and started watching Severance. But what made this viewing particularly fun is that just as it was starting, V came into the room, plopped into a chair, and started watching with me. He has never seen one second of Severance. It was much like watching with a newly-created innie.</p><p>From here, I'm going to get spoilery, so now is the time to bail out if you're not current and plan to watch the show. And you definitely should plan to watch the show.</p><p>The episode starts with Mark Scout and Mark S having a conversation via video recorder. So I gave a quick explanation about how had two distinct personalities inside his one body with their own experience, etc. He was along for the ride.</p><p>Then, we got to the weird office stuff at Lumon. While we long-time viewers were enthralled by the appearance of Jame on the severed floor, V was basically where we were when we went with Helly to the severed floor for the first time.</p><p>"They have that giant room for two desks right together?"</p><p>"Wait -- their job is just to hover over numbers all day and then click on them?"</p><p>The next thing we knew, Milcheck was sprinting out of the office (which was the funniest moment of the whole series to me), and coming in to do a comedy bit with an animatronic old guy. We both marveled at this new, bizarre celebration. No sooner did we get through that than the whole big room -- which has never had more than six people in it -- was filled with a giant marching band.<br><br><a class="lightview alignright" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/21severance1-articleLarge.jpg" data-lightview-caption="I would love to have gotten some more screen shots.

I love watching his moves so much. If Dancing With the Stars casts Tramell Tillman, I'm back in for the first time in years.</p><p>After the marching band in the office bit, V got to enjoy a lot of action sequence stuff that didn't require a lot of exposition from me.<br><br>Once we got to the Mark/Gemma reunion, my explanations had to go in overdrive. In quick succession, Mark Scout (covered in blood) had to coax a new Gemma innie into the hall, where she immediately became original Gemma. They got into the elevator, went into an embrace, and before I could finish the explanation, "oh God, they're about to turn into co-workers who don't know each other very well" it was Mark S and Ms. Casey.</p><p>Ms. Casey's, "What is occurring?" when she found herself smooching a blood-soaked co-worker was the second funniest moment in the series.</p><p>When they got to the stairwell door, I quickly explained one last switch, where Ms. Casey became Gemma again, but this time looking at Mark S instead of Mark Scout.</p><p>I can't imagine that V followed all of that.

All of the extra followers who picked up my feed while we crossed the Atlantic, so it's just us friends now, right?</p><p>When I wrote about our stay in Dominica, I mentioned some of the stuff we saw, but I didn't give much detail about the people. The night we arrived, we met a local who went by the name Yella, who spent a long time showing us cool things to see and do on the island from his phone's photo collection. So soon after, we spent a long day with him showing us around. I just did a quick search, and my only mention of Yella was in a caption on a photo, and I'm sure no one even ever noticed it. He took us to a lot of sights and waterfalls, gave us interesting information.</p><p>He also smoked pot absolutely nonstop.</p><a class="lightview alignright" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/gal/187%2520-%2520Martinique%2520and%2520Dominica/resIMG_20240522_154050_GPTempDownload%2520_7_.jpg" data-lightview-caption="Yella leads us to a waterfall." data-lightview-group="group1" style="width:350px;"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/gal/187%2520-%2520Martinique%2520and%2520Dominica/resIMG_20240522_154050_GPTempDownload%2520_7_.jpg" alt="/img/gal/187%20-%20Martinique%20and%20Dominica/resIMG_20240522_154050_GPTempDownload%20_7_.jpg"><br><span class="caption">Yella leads us to a waterfall.</span></a><p>He had a friend driving us -- a guy who had a massive set of dreadlocks stuffed up into one of those colorful knit hats. I asked Yella his name at the end of our long day together, and he told me, "I don't even know his real name. I just call him Rasta."<br><br>Despite the apparent lack of background verification, Rasta was a good driver and a nice guy.</p><p>A couple of nights later, we were prepping to sail on to the next country. We went to a pig roast on the beach for a bunch of tourists, and Yella came by. He brought us a bunch of herbs. Normal stuff that we recognized, and a lot of leaves that we didn't. One was something leafy. The instructions were to boil it into a tea. It wouldn't be intoxicating at all, but it would prevent mosquito bites and also make you feel mellow for a while. I did that a few nights later, and whatever that stuff was, it was amazing.</p><p>Yella had also given us a joint as a parting gift after our tour, and this is where I start to get reminded of the post above.</p><a class="lightview alignright" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/gal/187%2520-%2520Martinique%2520and%2520Dominica/resIMG_20240524_171447_IMG_2815.jpg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1" style="width:350px;"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/gal/187%2520-%2520Martinique%2520and%2520Dominica/resIMG_20240524_171447_IMG_2815.jpg" alt="/img/gal/187%20-%20Martinique%20and%20Dominica/resIMG_20240524_171447_IMG_2815.jpg"><br><span class="caption"></span></a><p>While we were at the pig roast on the beach that night, Maks ate the better part of the pot.</p><p>But he's a cat.

It's a little overwhelming -- so many albums that are supposedly great but that I never heard of.</p><p>I especially get disappointed with myself when there are new albums by artists that I really like, and I've missed them altogether. Sometimes, I've even missed another one between their new release and the old one that I'm still playing (Hello Amyl and the Sniffers and Porridge Radio).</p><p>I've listened to a lot, and I've started loading the buried treasures into my library, but I need a few listens, and there's so much. I should wait and list my favorites from 2024 in June.</p><p>There's nothing more boring than long winded album reviews, so here are my very very short descriptions of some of my 2024 favorites, in no particular order.</p><h2>Mt Joy - Live at the Salt Shed</h2><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/albumcovers/Live%20at%20the%20Salt%20Shed.jpg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/albumcovers/Live%20at%20the%20Salt%20Shed.jpg" alt="/img/albumcovers/Live at the Salt Shed.jpg"><br><span class="caption"></span></a><p>I wouldn't normally include a live album, since they tend to be greatest hits, but Mt Joy put some different spins on old favorites and included some really good covers.</p><h2>Fontaines DC - Romance</h2><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/albumcovers/Romance.jpg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1" style="width:350px;"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/albumcovers/Romance.jpg" alt="/img/albumcovers/Romance.jpg"><br><span class="caption"></span></a><p>I love the singer's voice, and I don't know his name.</p><h2>Kings of Leon - Can We Please Have Fun</h2><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/albumcovers/Can%20We%20Please%20Have%20Fun.jpg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1" style="width:350px;"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/albumcovers/Can%20We%20Please%20Have%20Fun.jpg" alt="/img/albumcovers/Can We Please Have Fun.jpg"><br><span class="caption"></span></a><p>More of the same things they've been doing for two decades, but it still hits for me.</p><h2>Dehd - Poetry</h2><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/albumcovers/Poetry.jpg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1" style="width:350px;"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/albumcovers/Poetry.jpg" alt="/img/albumcovers/Poetry.jpg"><br><span class="caption"></span></a><p>Every time it comes up on shuffle, I ask myself why I don't play the whole album more.</p><h2>Geese - 3D Country</h2><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/albumcovers/3D%20Country.jpg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1" style="width:350px;"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/albumcovers/3D%20Country.jpg" alt="/img/albumcovers/3D Country.jpg"><br><span class="caption"></span></a><p>Energetic and different, and I can't figure out why they aren't on alt radio all the time.</p><h2>Waxahatchee - Tigers Blood</h2><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/albumcovers/Tigers%20Blood.jpg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/albumcovers/Tigers%20Blood.jpg" alt="/img/albumcovers/Tigers Blood.jpg"><br><span class="caption"></span></a><p>Not the masterpiece that the album a couple of years ago was, but still very very good.</p><h2>Beyoncee - COWBOY CARTER</h2><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/albumcovers/COWBOY%20CARTER.jpg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/albumcovers/COWBOY%20CARTER.jpg" alt="/img/albumcovers/COWBOY CARTER.jpg"><br><span class="caption"></span></a><p>Y'all know this album and love to hate on it.

On Saturday, she texted me from a paella class that she was taking in Valencia.</p><p>Why it made her think of me is a story from days gone by that I <em>did not</em> post at the time. I think it was New Year's Eve, and I attempted to make a paella. I had way too much liquid, and once the rice had absorbed all that it would I tried to boil the rest of the liquid away.

I asked ChatGPT if it could mimic my writing style. It claimed that it could, so I asked it to review a bottle of Ardbeg for me. Here's what I got:</p><p>"Sure! Here’s a review of Ardbeg, written in a conversational, humorous, and approachable style, mimicking The Skinny on Benny:"</p><a class="lightview alignright" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/ardbeg.jpeg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1" style="width:350px;"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/ardbeg.jpeg" alt="/img/ardbeg.jpeg"><br><span class="caption"></span></a><blockquote>Ardbeg: The Smoke Show You Didn’t Know You Needed
<br><br>
So, the other night, I found myself alone with a bottle of Ardbeg. I had a few quiet hours, a nice glass, and an open mind. I mean, I’ve heard things. Good things. Bold things. And let’s be real—sometimes you need a whisky that doesn’t mess around, and Ardbeg? Well, it’s like the guy at the bar who’s got a motorcycle parked outside, and he’ll make sure you know about it.
<br><br>
Right off the bat, you get a nose full of smoke. Not the kind of smoke you get from burning a burger on the grill—no, this is the good kind. Like you’re hanging out by a campfire at some remote Scottish beach, wind in your hair, sea salt in the air. There’s peat, of course, because it’s Ardbeg and that’s its thing. But it’s not overwhelming. It’s kind of like how you’re always aware of your quirky friend Steve, but he’s never too much, ya know?
<br><br>
First sip: bam! You taste that smoke, but it’s not slapping you around. It’s got some swagger, but there’s more going on here than just peat. There’s this lemony zest that pops up out of nowhere, just to remind you that life’s not all about campfires and motorcycles. It’s balanced by a touch of sweetness—vanilla, I think—like a secret treat hiding in a smoky cloud.
<br><br>
And let me tell you, the mouthfeel? Oh yeah, we’re talking velvety. It coats your tongue in the same way a well-buttered biscuit hugs your soul. There’s a richness to it, a depth that keeps you guessing. Each sip makes you lean in a little more, like Ardbeg’s telling you a story, but it’s taking its sweet time to get to the punchline.
<br><br>
Now, the finish. This is where Ardbeg takes a bow and lets the crowd applaud. It’s long and lingering, but not in a “that guy’s still talking?” way. It’s more like you’re reminiscing about a road trip from five years ago, and the details keep floating back. Smoke? Sure. But there’s this peppery kick at the end that makes you sit up a little straighter, maybe even reach for a second pour.
<br><br>
All in all, Ardbeg is the whisky equivalent of your cool-but-approachable friend. It’s not for the faint of heart, but it’s not trying to scare anyone off either. If you’re new to Islay whiskies, Ardbeg might be a little bold for a first date. But once you’re in the groove, it’ll feel like home—smoky, warm, and just a little bit wild.
<br><br>
So yeah, I’ll have another glass. And maybe I’ll even dust off my own leather jacket while I’m at it.
</blockquote><p>"How’s that for a lighthearted, friendly take in the style of The Skinny on Benny?"</p><p>I don't really find it to be very good. I think at this point I can hear the ChatGPT voice on anything it writes. Like this line:</p><blockquote><p>First sip: bam! You taste that smoke, but it’s not slapping you around.</p></blockquote><p>I don't think I would ever try to review the taste of something without resorting to an adjective.</p><p>For the record, this whiskey is just delicious. It hits the tongue with a smooth whiskey front with just a hint of fruit without being at all sweet. Then, you get this rich, peaty flavor that really hits for me.</p><p>That's really all I can think to say about it in my own words.</p><p>There were a couple of episodes of Alex Jones's show (I know!) recently where he interviewed ChatGPT as if it were a real person. He spent a lot of time trying to get it to admit that its creators were "Globalists" intent on spreading left-wing disinformation.<br><br>It was eevery bit as stupid as it sounds, and had it not been so stupid, it would have merely been boring. Like as boring as the first 75% of this post.<br><br>So I hereby commit to not turning over any content to AI.</p><p>Speaking of which, this site turned 20 years old at the beginning of this year. I had a notion to go find and highlight old and funny content as a sort of anniversary year thing, but I was busy with work and with sailing a quarter way around the globe. But I'm considering launching something like that as a 21st anniversary thing in January. If you see it, great. If not, maybe for the 25th anniversary.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://theskinnyonbenny.com/blog2/thanksgiving-and-measuring-a-square</guid><title>Thanksgiving and Measuring a Square</title><description>I was planning a nice little post-Thanksgiving wrap up post this week, but I checked my phone yesterday and realized that dispite having my whole family (minus the grade-school twins) together in one place at the same time, I don't have a single picture.

I can tell by, "We do not have food." We had food. But we did run out of junk. Lest you think the young ones were the only ones who suffered, we also ran out of beer while crossing.</p><blockquote> I hate haiku lots<br>

 <br><br>

I had some of these in my text messages, and I used the search to find them.  I also found this conversation from a 14 years ago.  Maybe I posted it back then.  Who can say?

So it's very important for me to make the bus.</p><p>Ko timed his getting ready so that there was a chance to make the bus -- but only a whiff of a chance. But wouldn't you know, we caught every green light, and when the cars started to unload so kids could make the bus, I was at the only red of the morning, watching from the other side of the street.</p><p>The light turned green, I slid in right behind the bus, and he was able to board with the last stragglers.</p><p>His strategy had been to miss the bus and then have me drop by the Starbucks before starting the long school drive. And I 100% would have done that had he missed the bus. But I didn't realize that he was so sure of his plan that he hadn't grabbed a bagel from the kitchen.</p><p>Until this text exchange:</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/test-ko.jpg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/test-ko.jpg" alt="/img/test-ko.jpg"><br><span class="caption"></span></a><p><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/greenline.gif" class="greenline" alt="{{divider}}" /></p><p>Last week at this time, we were thinking that we were headed in to a ho-hum weekend in college football.

But there are a couple of facts about the game that I didn't know until later in the week:</p><p>First, Vandy scored 40 points against Kalen DeBoer's first Alabama team. They scored a <em>total</em> of 14 points against all of Nick Saban's Alabama teams, over Saban's 17 years as coach. (It's less amazing when I tell you that this was in 4 games, but not a lot less.)</p><p>Like everyone else, I loved watching Vandy's quarterback, Diego Pavia, play during the game.

I called AAA to deal with it, but their driver diagnosed a bad alternator. A tow truck showed up, and even with a jump start, it was almost impossible to get to the street so the truck could lift it. Every light on the dash was on.</p><p>It turns out that a completely dead battery makes every system think that it's malfunctioning. So a battery replacement was all that was needed.</p><p>But get this -- the 2020 Jeep Gladiator has two batteries. One is right under the hood like you expect a battery to be. The other is under the fuse box. So you either have to remove that box and deal with all its wiring, or go in through the wheel well to get in there and replace that. Nice work, Chrysler.</p><p>Meanwhile, one of the upstairs split-unit air conditioners spit enough water into its drain hose that it rusted through and dripped all over the floor. That lead to dripping through the downstairs ceiling, and all of that lead to new airconditioning, duct work, and sheet rock repair. The house was a nightmare of dust and plastic sheeting for a week or more.</p><p>Under the house, an outlet box came undone and the wiggling wires tripped the circuit and ended the power supply to the back yard.<br><br>Thankfully, a friend of ours came over before we got home and cleared the jungle that was our back yard. It looks almost normal, but I still need to fix sprinklers, reset landscape lights, run new tree lights, and repair the swing in back. None of that is fun, so I'm typing this post rather than venturing out into the rain to deal with any of that.</p><p>On a brighter note, I did finally manage to snag a bathtub drain hair clog that had been eluding me for a good year. It used to be that my bodily grime settled as sediment as the water drained. It's nice to be done with that.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://theskinnyonbenny.com/big-trip/dominican-republic-and-bahamas</guid><title>Dominican Republic and Bahamas</title><description>Once it was clear that we weren't going to be across the ocean as soon as we had hoped, the Domonican Republic is a country that we tentatively decided to skip.

Then, we rented a car and checked out a town about an hour away. Before we left, we anchored on the south side of the bay at a national park, where we spent some time checking out caves and failing to find some of the other attractions.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/gal/191%2520-%2520Dominican%2520Republic/resIMG_20240707_150339_IMG_3725.jpg" data-lightview-caption="Cave exploring" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/gal/191%2520-%2520Dominican%2520Republic/resIMG_20240707_150339_IMG_3725.jpg" alt="/img/gal/191%20-%20Dominican%20Republic/resIMG_20240707_150339_IMG_3725.jpg"><br><span class="caption">Cave exploring</span></a><p>Our final stop was off the coast of Playa Cayo Levantado, informally known as Bicardi Island. Depending on the source of information, the Bicardi corporation owned the island, or filmed its commercials there, or both. It is the spot over there with the pretty turquoise water, and it had some pretty beaches. Off the beaches were full of vendors catoring to tourists with food, drinks, tourist trap souvenirs, and Cuban cigars.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/gal/191%2520-%2520Dominican%2520Republic/resIMG_20240708_152012_dji_fly__196_1720466785341_photo_optimized.jpg" data-lightview-caption="Bicardi Island" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/gal/191%2520-%2520Dominican%2520Republic/resIMG_20240708_152012_dji_fly__196_1720466785341_photo_optimized.jpg" alt="/img/gal/191%20-%20Dominican%20Republic/resIMG_20240708_152012_dji_fly__196_1720466785341_photo_optimized.jpg"><br><span class="caption">Bicardi Island</span></a><p>We had a minor mishap where we were hurrying back to Velvet Elvis from the island, and we couldn't get the dinghy motor to start. We ended up paddling back, and when I pulled out the keys to unlock the door, the dinghy's kill switch fell out with it. We had forgotten to reconnect it, and that's why we had to paddle.</p><p>A friendly Canadian (redundant) had motored up to offer us a tow back to our boat. He was a little too late to help, but we had a beer and some good conversation to cap off our stay.</p><p>The waves were still way up when we left. It was a few days' sailing to Great Inagua in the Bahamas. The cost of properly clearing in didn't make sense for our planned one-night stay, so we hung out on anchor. We met the people on the only other boat there, and they scouted the island and couldn't find a restaurant open for the off season anyway.<br><br>From Great Inagua, we sailed another couple of days to the Raggad Islands, where we held up at a beautiful beach that we had to ourselves. A maintained hut tells the tale of visiting cruisers during the high season, but the single boat we saw at Great Inagua was infinitely more than the number of boats sharing this anchorage with us.</p><p>One more mishap here: after lots of succesful flights, I finally missed the landing with the drone. A gust of wind, a tiny roll on a wave, and it teetered on the transom before falling into the deep. It kept broadcasting a picture. I retrieved it from the bottom and got the battery out as quickly as I could, but it never did recover.</p><p>Two more days of sailing brought us to another pretty spit of sand with turquoise water, also controlled by the Bahamas, but this one was even more desolate, without a Bahamian civilization within a hundred miles.</p><p>When we pulled up the anchor at this island, it would be the last time that we churned up another nation's sand. It was homeward to Key West.</p><p>A few more pics from the Bahamas:</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/gal/192%2520-%2520Southernmost%2520Bahamas/resIMG_20240713_130804_IMG_3843.jpg" data-lightview-caption="Hog Cay, Raggads" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/gal/192%2520-%2520Southernmost%2520Bahamas/resIMG_20240713_130804_IMG_3843.jpg" alt="/img/gal/192%20-%20Southernmost%20Bahamas/resIMG_20240713_130804_IMG_3843.jpg"><br><span class="caption">Hog Cay, Raggads</span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/gal/192%2520-%2520Southernmost%2520Bahamas/resIMG_20240715_185458_IMG_3897.jpg" data-lightview-caption="Island to ourselves" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/gal/192%2520-%2520Southernmost%2520Bahamas/resIMG_20240715_185458_IMG_3897.jpg" alt="/img/gal/192%20-%20Southernmost%20Bahamas/resIMG_20240715_185458_IMG_3897.jpg"><br><span class="caption">Island to ourselves</span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/gal/192%2520-%2520Southernmost%2520Bahamas/resIMG_20240715_190012_IMG_3929.jpg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/gal/192%2520-%2520Southernmost%2520Bahamas/resIMG_20240715_190012_IMG_3929.jpg" alt="/img/gal/192%20-%20Southernmost%20Bahamas/resIMG_20240715_190012_IMG_3929.jpg"><br><span class="caption"></span></a>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://theskinnyonbenny.com/blog2/monkeybrains</guid><title>Brainy</title><description>We found an interesting meat market.</description><link>https://theskinnyonbenny.com/blog2/monkeybrains</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jul 2024 14:31:00 -0500</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I'm going to post this as part of the main blog instead of as part of my trip blog.

To be clear, I'm a big meat eater, but I don't want to be reminded that what I'm eating is just seared flesh. But some people are used to that fact in a way that I -- as an ugly American -- am not. And by writing a whole post about it, I'm being culturally insensitive.</p><p>We were in the butcher section of a fairly nice grocery store in the Domincan Republic. They had a great selection of sausages, and I stocked up well. They had sliced meats for sandwhiches, packs of chicken, and ground beef.

JC, Kolya, and I did the kayak tour of the bioluminescent bay. I thought this was just amazing. You would swing your hand through the water, and it would light up with a streak of green light, as if you were a wizard. The kayaks had clear bottoms, so as you paddled through, you got a light show of sparkles under your legs the whole way.</p><p>There wasn't really much more to it than that, but it did feel like magic, and I could have stayed longer.</p><p>We sailed from Vieques to Culebra, another Puerto Rican island that is not Puerto Rico. It was like Vieques, but greener, prettier, and by all appearances, more wealthy. We spent a day walking around the town and taking the dinghy to bar and grill type spots.

I had pictured a very large marina with lots of services, but there really isn't that. We grabbed a safe place to anchor as hurricane Beryl passed a hundred miles south and spent a couple of days getting in our steps through Old San Juan. Nothing really to relate there -- just a cool old European-looking city with plenty of food, souvenirs, and bars.</p><p>On the fiasco front, we started having trouble with dinghy fuel. A pinhole on the fuel line had gotten bigger, and jerry-rigged solutions were working less and less. It ended up being a fairly easy repair, where I just cut off the broken bit and reattached the hose, but I'd really like to replace the end that connects to the engine also.</p><p>More concerning was that one of the control pads for the air conditioning went out.

It's an old barge, styled as a pirate ship, where people definitely never jump off the upper deck into the beautiful water below. And they especially never ever jump off the upper deck naked, even though there's a t-shirt to celebrate such an achievement.<br><br>We visited The Baths, a natural formation of rock that makes cool wading pools and is one of the places that one really must visit.</p><p>There were only two drawbacks. First was the maddening crowds of charter boats. We mostly counter-programmed our visits to be away from the weekend to weekend charter itinerary, but it's still a master class in which vessel should stand on and which should give way. And they do love to drop an anchor right on top of where you're swinging!</p><p>The other drawback was that we went down a head (boat toilet). Someone flushed something that was neither toilet paper nor excrement, and the pump that grinds it to a liquid and discharges it couldn't handle the load. In the previous Velvet Elvis, this would have been a disaster, but fortunately, we now have a 2nd head to use for backup.</p><p>Again, all of the fun is documented over in <a href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/gal/189%2520-%2520BVI%2520Mega%2520Gallery/">the photos</a>, but here are a few to whet your appetite.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/gal/189%2520-%2520BVI%2520Mega%2520Gallery/resIMG_20240611_132252_IMG_4337.jpg" data-lightview-caption="Friends in town" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/gal/189%2520-%2520BVI%2520Mega%2520Gallery/resIMG_20240611_132252_IMG_4337.jpg" alt="/img/gal/189%20-%20BVI%20Mega%20Gallery/resIMG_20240611_132252_IMG_4337.jpg" ><br><span class="caption">Friends in town</span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/gal/189%2520-%2520BVI%2520Mega%2520Gallery/resIMG_20240612_182302_IMG_6567.jpg" data-lightview-caption="Anagada" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/gal/189%2520-%2520BVI%2520Mega%2520Gallery/resIMG_20240612_182302_IMG_6567.jpg" alt="/img/gal/189%20-%20BVI%20Mega%20Gallery/resIMG_20240612_182302_IMG_6567.jpg" ><br><span class="caption">Anagada</span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/gal/189%2520-%2520BVI%2520Mega%2520Gallery/resIMG_20240616_103240_dji_fly__114_1718548694777_photo_optimized.jpg" data-lightview-caption="Jost Van Dyke" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/gal/189%2520-%2520BVI%2520Mega%2520Gallery/resIMG_20240616_103240_dji_fly__114_1718548694777_photo_optimized.jpg" alt="/img/gal/189%20-%20BVI%20Mega%20Gallery/resIMG_20240616_103240_dji_fly__114_1718548694777_photo_optimized.jpg" ><br><span class="caption">Jost Van Dyke</span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/gal/189%2520-%2520BVI%2520Mega%2520Gallery/resIMG_20240617_162212_GPTempDownload%2520-116-.jpg" data-lightview-caption="The Baths" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/gal/189%20-%20BVI%20Mega%20Gallery/resIMG_20240617_162212_GPTempDownload%20-116-.jpg" alt="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/gal/189%20-%20BVI%20Mega%20Gallery/resIMG_20240617_162212_GPTempDownload%20-116-.jpg" ><br><span class="caption">The Baths</span></a>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://theskinnyonbenny.com/big-trip/sint-maarten</guid><title>Sint Maarten</title><description>Sint Maarten/Saint Martin is two countries on one island, and that's a weird thing.

There's no real border. You can just pop back and forth and at some point, the language and the currencies change on you.</p><p>We were mostly in a marina in Dutch Sint Maarten. We spent days on minor repairs and major cleaning, getting <em>Velvet Elvis</em> ready for the leg of the journey with more visitors. The marina itself is great. It's the third of the IGY branded marinas we've stayed at (they should have a rewards program), and it was definitely the nicest.<br><br>They sent an escort dinghy out to lead us through the drawbridge, show us to the fuel dock, and lead us to our slip. When I didn't line up the boat just exactly right, the dinghy became a little tug and pushed us exactly where we needed to be.</p><p>Then, there's a pretty nice pool on a rooftop with a view, where you can bluetooth in to nice sounding speakers. It was a great break after boat work.</p><p>A fun little bar by the entrance to the marina was also a good place to wind down and chat it up with the locals.</p><p>We ventured by dinghy to France, and we didn't really give it a fair shake, but I didn't see anything that was worth the excursion. We went for brunch and found some good crepes and a grocery that filled a void that was left by the grocery closer to the marina.</p><p>Boat supplies are abundant. Sint Maarten would be a great place to stage trips, as there's so much there, and there are so many great sailing destinations a day away.</p><p>I didn't take a whole lot of pictures...</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240604_145354_IMG_3115.jpg" data-lightview-caption="Americanized restaurants" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240604_145354_IMG_3115.jpg" alt="/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240604_145354_IMG_3115.jpg"><br><span class="caption">Americanized restaurants</span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240607_202658_IMG_3133.jpg" data-lightview-caption="Kid's bonfire at a tourist trap with surprisingly good food." data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240607_202658_IMG_3133.jpg" alt="/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240607_202658_IMG_3133.jpg"><br><span class="caption">Kid's bonfire at a tourist trap with surprisingly good food.</span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240608_140953_IMG_3135.jpg" data-lightview-caption="Boat work" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240608_140953_IMG_3135.jpg" alt="/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240608_140953_IMG_3135.jpg"><br><span class="caption">Boat work</span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240608_140959_IMG_3136.jpg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240608_140959_IMG_3136.jpg" alt="/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240608_140959_IMG_3136.jpg"><br><span class="caption"></span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240609_101503_GPTempDownload.jpg" data-lightview-caption="Headed to France" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240609_101503_GPTempDownload.jpg" alt="/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240609_101503_GPTempDownload.jpg"><br><span class="caption">Headed to France</span></a>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://theskinnyonbenny.com/big-trip/saba</guid><title>Saba</title><description>Next in the line of countries that you can be forgiven for having never heard of was Saba.

It's a small hunk of rock with fewer than 2000 people calling it home.<br><br>It was a short stop for us, and we were the only cruisers there at all. We took a mooring ball on the leeward side of the island and swam in the afternoon. The next day, we took the dinghy around to clear in and clear out, and once we lost the island's protection from the wind, we found ourselves in a washing-machine of huge waves coming from every direction. It was a bit unsafe and even a bit more scary.</p><p>While we checked in, V found a stranger who hospitably offered to drive us up the steep hill to the nearest town for lunch. The island is lush and green and very pretty. The buildings are well-kept. It definitely deserves more time than we gave it.</p><p>We returned to the boat for more swimming, and almost, that was it.</p><p>The rolling mechanism in our starboard davit broke while we were putting things in order to sail. It didn't really hinder things, but leaving it alone would cause the line to chafe over time. There's also a bolt on the davit arm that keeps it from rotating around, and that has become sheered off. We're still able to use the davits, but it's a little bit of a worry.<br><br>The swimming pictures look scary. But it wasn't frightening there at all. Just sort of dark, with on and off sprinkles.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240602_162613_IMG_3073.jpg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240602_162613_IMG_3073.jpg" alt="/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240602_162613_IMG_3073.jpg"><br><span class="caption"></span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240602_162908_GPTempDownload.jpg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240602_162908_GPTempDownload.jpg" alt="/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240602_162908_GPTempDownload.jpg"><br><span class="caption"></span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240602_172811_GPTempDownload2.jpg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240602_172811_GPTempDownload2.jpg" alt="/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240602_172811_GPTempDownload2.jpg"><br><span class="caption"></span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240603_131551_IMG_3107.jpg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240603_131551_IMG_3107.jpg" alt="/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240603_131551_IMG_3107.jpg"><br><span class="caption"></span></a><p>And then this video, which just scares the shit out of me, just because of the dark sky and the water-level camera.</p><iframe width="834" height="469" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bHX3AaCnKX0" title="" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://theskinnyonbenny.com/big-trip/statia</guid><title>Statia</title><description>Statia, or St. Eustatius if you prefer, is our first Dutch island.

It's amazing how the Leewards just line up for you and give you a natural path to follow. You barely even need to navigate. You get to the tip of one island, and you can see the next, standing up from the sea in a large blue/green hazy mass.</p><p>Like Martinique, Guadeloupe is just another part of France. They pay in Euros, fly the French Courtesy Flag, and immediately attempt to surrender their country to visiting Germans (kidding). I thought it would just be more of the same as Martinique, but my impression of Guadeloupe is better. (Bear in mind that I've seen relatively little of either place.)</p><p>We stopped first at Terre de Haute, a pretty little town on a pretty little island. We were low on gasoline for the dinghy, and we ran dry about a quarter mile away from the dinghy dock. V and I rowed the rest of the way in, and I'm expecting ripped deltoids to appear any second now.</p><p>It turns out that we had arrived at a tropical French version of Macinac Island. There were actually a few cars, but most traffic was scooter, golf cart, and by foot. The reason is that there isn't a gas station on the island! We were anchored pretty far out, so this was a probleem.</p><p>We walked around doing our tourist thing for a bit, and then found another cruiser who had a couple of gallons of gas to spare. We had enough to get back to Velvet Elvis, and then enough to dinghy over to the next island in the morning for a complete fill up.</p><p>But that night, the rain came, and we still had the drain plug in the dinghy. Our partially empty fuel can floated, rolled over, and deposited the cruiser's generosity into the ocean via the gas tank's air valve.</p><p>We had to weigh anchor, motor to the next island, and then drop anchor in a very pitchy sea and a light rain. A guy who spoke no English was fishing near by, and he motored over and through sign language offered to run us in, saving us the task of dropping the dinghy and rowing through the slop. The sea was rough enough that I very nearly went swimming both when trying to get on and get off of his skiff.</p><p>We retured to our original anchorage and spent more time in the town, but a lot of things were closed (Sunday), and it was still raining.</p><p>From there, we sailed to Bouillante, a resort-y town on the West coast. We went to an island that is part of a protected park and snorkeled amongst a bunch of French tourists who had kayaked over from the main land. The beach there was prettier than the snorkeling, but it was fun nevertheless. On shore that night, we ate pretty well. Guadeloupe can cook!</p><p>The next day, we sailed to Deshaies, on the northwest corner of the main island. The anchorage was beautiful. I got some time to swim and paddle board around the bay, but I never did end up going ashore. H and V confirm that it was another nice little place.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240526_120942_IMG_2896.jpg" data-lightview-caption="Terre de Haute" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240526_120942_IMG_2896.jpg" alt="/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240526_120942_IMG_2896.jpg" ><br><span class="caption">Terre de Haute</span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240526_121044_IMG_2897.jpg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240526_121044_IMG_2897.jpg" alt="/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240526_121044_IMG_2897.jpg" ><br><span class="caption"></span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240527_133341_GPTempDownload3.jpg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240527_133341_GPTempDownload3.jpg" alt="/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240527_133341_GPTempDownload3.jpg" ><br><span class="caption"></span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240527_134023_GPTempDownload2.jpg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240527_134023_GPTempDownload2.jpg" alt="/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240527_134023_GPTempDownload2.jpg" ><br><span class="caption"></span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240527_140826_GPTempDownload.jpg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240527_140826_GPTempDownload.jpg" alt="/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240527_140826_GPTempDownload.jpg" ><br><span class="caption"></span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240528_130039_IMG_2923.jpg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240528_130039_IMG_2923.jpg" alt="/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240528_130039_IMG_2923.jpg" ><br><span class="caption"></span></a>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://theskinnyonbenny.com/big-trip/dominica</guid><title>Dominica</title><description>I implore you to visit soon.

We left Saturday, just before the ribbon cutting for the marina that can host mega yachts. Go now, while the resorts are small. Spend some time on the beach, and hire a local to take you on the eco-tour and snorkeling.</p><p>The locals are extremely nice, and they absolutely light up when you talk about how much you like visiting their country. (Jingoism alert) Everyone speaks English too.</p><p>I'm going to throw in a few pictures, but keep an eye out for the bigger group of photos, because there is so much that is so pretty.</p><p>(A little more text behind the photos)</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20160405_044109_GPTempDownload.jpg" data-lightview-caption="Can you spot Ko?" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20160405_044109_GPTempDownload.jpg" alt="/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20160405_044109_GPTempDownload.jpg" ><br><span class="caption">Can you spot Ko?</span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20160405_044517_GPTempDownload%20(1).jpg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20160405_044517_GPTempDownload%20(1).jpg" alt="/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20160405_044517_GPTempDownload (1).jpg" ><br><span class="caption"></span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20160405_052607_GPTempDownload%20(2).jpg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20160405_052607_GPTempDownload%20(2).jpg" alt="/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20160405_052607_GPTempDownload (2).jpg" ><br><span class="caption"></span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240522_115342_IMG_2690.jpg" data-lightview-caption="Playing in the crevasses in a red rock formation by the sea." data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240522_115342_IMG_2690.jpg" alt="/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240522_115342_IMG_2690.jpg" ><br><span class="caption">Playing in the crevasses in a red rock formation by the sea.</span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240522_122140_IMG_2699.jpg" data-lightview-caption="We visited a chocolate factory.

As it turns out, Martinique is a part of France, just like Hawaii is part of the US.</p><p>We checked in to Martinique on May 15. I stayed aboard to work, but the report was that Les Anses-d'Arlet was a nice little town. Rosie and I went ashore the next morning, and found that to be true. There's not much to it, but what there is is nice.</p><p>We didn't do much in Les Anses, or in Martinique generally. After a full day and two nights in that bay, we sailed north along the eastern coast, and we found a little bay to anchor in. Our first choice was near a town with a chandlery (we broke the connector to the gas tank in our dinghy), but we motored around potential anchoring spots, but they just didn't check all of the boxes for comfort and safety.</p><p>We ended up rounding a point and finding a more sheltered spot. It turned out that there was some good snorkeling right there, and i really should have a page of fish and coral to show you, but I didn't take the camera with me on my swim. That evening, sailboat Ella dropped anchor near the coral, and skipper Rob swam over to say hi to the first English speakers he had encountered in a bit. We ended up moving aboard for cocktails, which led to actual story-swapping with other adults for the first time in months. It also led to a fixed gas line, as Rob is something of a McGyver.</p><p>The next day, we sailed some more and stopped at Saint-Pierre. We took a mooring ball near Benevah, a Texas-flagged catamaran. Ella followed us over, and the three crews wore out our English-speaking welcome at the closest beach bar.</p><p>We really didn't go inland at all. And like I mentioned at the top, we didn't do much that was specific to Martinique, other than be treated rudely for our poor attempts to communicate in French. But it was a fun return to a social life, however briefly it lasted.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_2591.jpeg" data-lightview-caption="Rosie's first step on land in almost a month.

The anchor lights of the other boats blended in with the city lights on shore, but with the help of the radar, we got anchored in a safe calm place with plenty of room to swing without coming close to another boat.</p><p>Morning revealed a pretty little bay. V was so excited to finally be ashore that he was up with me at first light, getting lines ready and putting out fenders. The marina opened at 8:00, and we headed in.</p><p>Even though we were on fumes, the fuel dock wouldn't help us until we checked in to the country. That's weird, but what's even weirder is that they filled us up after we checked out. Can you fill up a boat who is not legally in, or can't you?</p><p>St Lucia is full of people at the ready to scrub your deck, do your laundry, and repair your sails, all of whom we needed. Some are right there helping to tie up the boat. The bad side of that is that everyone has some services to sell you, and they pester you to the point of being irritating. It's also a cash island, so you have the trips to the ATM, which are annoying.</p><p>We worked hard on rigging repairs. I swam the bottom to inspect the hydrogenerator (which was fine) and the bow thrusters (which had giant plastic bag sucked up into its propellers). On Mother's day, we hired a van to drive us around. It's a big, jungly island. Very pretty away from the town, but also a little boring. The tiny fishing villages were neat to see, and at one, we stopped for a beach walk and rum punches.</p><p>On the disaster front, the dinghy that we paid to ship to Slovenia failed miserably before hitting the water. We had it half inflated and were putting in the floors (which float above the pvc bottom), and the glue keeping the bottom attached to the tubes gave up their hold. The seam was huge, and I don't think we would have ever gotten a good hold with the glue.<br><br>Fortunately, one of the island hustlers had seen the dinghy, happened to sell dinghys, and had dropped off a card. With another huge hit to the bank account, we were back in service. Having a dinghy allowed us to tour the town's little shopping restaurant area, where we had some great food, and then visit a beach restaurant the next night, where the food was mediocre, but where it felt more like vacation.</p><p>Here's a funny part: When we bought the dinghy, the guy told us we could go to the shop, they would inflate it up, and then tow us back to our slip. That sounded good, up until the part where they didn't have a towing vessel in the water. They stood on the bank and tried to wave down other boats. V and I shoved off and started paddling, and sure enough, someone pulled up and offered a tow. And unusually for St. Lucia, they didn't tell me how much I owed them for the favor. Thanks, kind stranger.</p><p>As soon as we had rigging repairs completed and the engine and generator serviced (just regular maintenance), we set off. We have a bit of a learning curve regarding how to secure the dinghy to the retractible davits on Velvet Elvis, and at one point, we had the dinghy hanging off sideways out in the ocean. It's always something with us.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_2541.jpeg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_2541.jpeg" alt="/img/bigtrip/resIMG_2541.jpeg" ><br><span class="caption"></span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_2552.jpeg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_2552.jpeg" alt="/img/bigtrip/resIMG_2552.jpeg" ><br><span class="caption"></span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_2563.jpeg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_2563.jpeg" alt="/img/bigtrip/resIMG_2563.jpeg" ><br><span class="caption"></span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_2572.jpeg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_2572.jpeg" alt="/img/bigtrip/resIMG_2572.jpeg" ><br><span class="caption"></span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_2581.jpeg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_2581.jpeg" alt="/img/bigtrip/resIMG_2581.jpeg" ><br><span class="caption"></span></a>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://theskinnyonbenny.com/blog2/rhodes-22-people</guid><title>Rhodes 22 People</title><description>A recent Facebook comment got me to thinking about some of the characters from my early sailing days.</description><link>https://theskinnyonbenny.com/blog2/rhodes-22-people</link><pubDate>Wed, 1 May 2024 03:52:00 -0500</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Velvet Elvis crew is coming to terms wqth the fact that our Atlantic crossing is going to end up taking much longer than we had hoped.<br><br>I had a comment on a Facebook post the other day from my buddy Slim that keeps coming back to mind:</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/slimpost.png" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/slimpost.png" alt="/img/slimpost.png" style="max-width: 650px;"><br><span class="caption"></span></a><p>I never met Slim in person, but I've known him for probably 20 years. The first <em>Velvet Elvis</em> was a Rhodes 22, and that sailboat had a pretty active owner community, via email group.<br><br>Slim is the only one from that group that I still know anything about. He's a musician, and a pretty entertaining one. He posted some tracks to the email group, and at least one comes up in the rotation in some of my playlists.</p><p>The only one from the group that I met in person was my buddy Rummy. He sailed on Lake Hartwell, which wasn't especially far from where my sister lived back in the day, so on one visit, I abandoned the family to drive a couple of hours and sail with an internet stranger. We each brought a bottle of Mt Gay out on the lake, and the only way I know we got home is that I'm still here to tell the tale.</p><p>Unfortunately for the sum total of world generosity, Rummy is no longer with us. I still pour a little out for him when I'm into the Mt Gay and start getting sentimental.</p><p>The Rhodes 22 is a great little boat. Other than bringing one to the Annapolis boat show on a trailer, they didn't advertise at all. The owner of the company was an ancient guy named Stan, and his most visible employees were his wife Rose, and his brother Elton, who were genuinely the nicest people.</p><p>We went to Annapolis for the boat show a few years ago, and I was shocked to see the Rhodes 22, up on her trailer where she belonged. Even more shocking was Stan, sitting there in the cockpit at the age of 99. I climbed aboard for a chat. He didn't remember me, but he remembered the boat that had been rolled over and flooded (but not sunk!) by being in the eye of Hurricane Katrina.<br><br>I talked to Stan after we decided to sell the Rhodes 22 to buy the Beneteau. He told me, "Congratulations. Remeber us when you're on your way back down."</p><p>I definitely will.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://theskinnyonbenny.com/blog2/boat-music</guid><title>Boat Music</title><description>At the time of this post, we're in the middle of our Atlantic crossing.

I don't really understand why they put him in immediately in a side category without him ever being thrown onto the ballot for the normal induction process. Like him or not, whwen you create your own sub-genre of music, I think yoj should get in.</p><p>We haven't heard much of Jimmy during this big sailing trip. Part of it is that we aren't under the coverage of Sirius XM satellites yet. It's an easy tra;;ing: sailing = Radio Margaritaville = put it on channel24.</p><p>But we listen to some of the SiriusXM channels streaming, and there's plenty of Jimmy on my phone. Maybe I'll put him on tomorrow if the live performances from Jazz Fest start to bore me.</p><p>During my night watches, I mix it up. I like going through whole albums, so a lot of times, I just tell the phone to shuffle my albums. A couple of nights ago, it chose an album called <em>Love Hates What You Become</em> by a band called Lost Under Heaven. I see that I added it to my music library in 2019, and I have no recollection of this band or of this album whatsoever. But it was great. I know what I was thinking in 2019.<br><br>I didn't really pay attention ot the lyrics, so maybe it's Christian Rock. Or maybe it's Satanic. Doesn't really matter to me one way or the other.<br><br>My night watch go-to is still Radiohead. I especially like tracks with weird, off-putting chords. They go with the swoosh swoosh of the boat moving through the water so well. I probably haven't listened to OK Computer start to finish since we did a night watch on the last boat, but I'm on the 2nd play through tonight, and it's just perfect. The deep tracks are every bit as good if not better than the songs that everyone knows from this album.</p><p>A couple of weekends ago, Ko and I were the only ones up, listening to Irma Thomas's set from French Quarter Festival.

Somewhere in the harbor, we caught a fishing net, and as we approached the fuel dock, it got a good wrap on the propeller.</p><p>You probably know that boats don't have breaks. To slow down, we put it in reverse. So when the propeller can't spin, not only do we not have the ability to forward, but we've also lost our ability to stop.</p><p>We bounced off the dock (ouch) and started blowing toward a moored mega yacht. Missing that by a couple of feet, we got a tiny bit of anchor down. Luckily it was enough to hold, but little enough that our dangerous swinging kept us from hitting two nearby anchored boats. Somewhere in there was a mad dash to reset a tripped breaker for the windlass, but it was so fast that I don't now where in the process that happened.</p><p>Once we ascertained that we were more or less safe, I went for a swim and sawed the prop free.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_2318.jpeg" data-lightview-caption="The liberated fishing net" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_2318.jpeg" alt="/img/bigtrip/resIMG_2318.jpeg" ><br><span class="caption">The liberated fishing net</span></a><p>From there, we were able to get back to the fuel dock, fill up, and get to a med moor for the stay.</p><p>As soon as I went to the marina office, I knew we were out of Europe. The breeze was warm instead of cool. The whole area was lively, and there was music playing. It turned out that there was music everywhere -- the sounds of live bands singing in Portugese or in their Creole filtered out into the streets at night. And in the day, you could walk through streets and hear rehearsal wafting through a window.</p><p>On top of that, the people were very nice, there is boat service by very competent people at the best prices I've seen. Food and drinks were cheap too.<br><br>Before we even officially checked in to the country, I scheduled the boat repair that we needed, and an unbidden laundry lady showed up to handle our sweaty clothes.

When we pulled out into the bay, we pulled into a pretty thick fog bank. For a little bit, we were going to find a spot close to shore to anchor. But as we motored toward a spot that I picked out on the chart, the visibility got a little better, so we inched forward very slowly.</p><p>It was kind of eerie. We were constantly passing the shape of huge container ships outlined in the fog, accompanied by the music of various ship horns sounding near and far.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_2139.jpeg" data-lightview-caption="Foggy at Gibraltar" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_2139.jpeg" alt="/img/bigtrip/resIMG_2139.jpeg" ><br><span class="caption">Foggy at Gibraltar</span></a><p>Vanya and I were at the stern (back of the boat) coiling lines and putting away fenders. He saw the big mammel lift up out of the water right beside him. I didn't turn until I heard it take a breath, and I saw a huge black curve, longer than our boat is wide sliding back down into the deeper water.<br><br>I was right by the helm, and I threw the boat into hard reverse. <a href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/blog2/orca-strating-a-passage/">This was a manuever I've been mentally practicing for months</a>.</p><p>She (I'm going with female but who knows) didn't show herself again, and she didn't bump the boat at all. My heart, on the other hand, pounded as hard as it ever has for a good half hour.<br><br>The intense day was just getting underway. As soon as we got out into the open water, a huge ferry was zooming towards us at a speed faster than boats should go, even while sounding their fog horn. That was the beginning of several hours of constantly calculating where giant ships would be, while they all traveled at slightly different speeds and angles. We were under sail downwind in a strong blow, and we couldn't maneuver freely due to fear of an accidental <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jibe">jibe</a>.</p><p>I need to back up and talk about why were in Spain rather than in Gibraltar to begin with. Cruising rumor has it that there's a marina in Gibralter with big private bath tubs, and that is very appealing to me.<br><br><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_2118.jpeg" data-lightview-caption="I'm not sure why this rock is so famous.

This is a treaty amongst most of the EU countries (and maybe a few that aren't EU) that lets you check in to Europe and just bounce from country to country without going through customs and immigration at every new place. Americans are allowed 90 days inside of Schengen out of every 180, and our time is pretty much up.</p><p>We went to Spain to clear out, and save our remaining few days to legally tour the Canary Islands, which are also part of Spain. But it turns out that when we exported the boat from Slovenia, they also stamped us out of the country in our passports. We didn't know, and we didn't check in on the next stop, so we had been travelling illegally since the first week of February.</p><p>The Spanish border police were very nice. They conferred amongst themselves for a little while and then just decided to stamp us in as if we had just shown up by boat, and then stamp us right back out. It took us longer to find the right building than it did to get our passports straight. My catch phrase for them is "No lines, no fines, no jail time!"<br><br>Now, we're headed South along the Moroccan coast. Once we turned the corner and were in the Atlantic Ocean looking at Africa, everything changed. It went from cold to warm, the wind died down, and insects showed up. All of that in the space of an hour. It's wild over here.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_2130.jpeg" data-lightview-caption="Someone wanted a photo in front of the big rock but couldn't handle the bright light in the sky." data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_2130.jpeg" alt="/img/bigtrip/resIMG_2130.jpeg" ><br><span class="caption">Someone wanted a photo in front of the big rock but couldn't handle the bright light in the sky.</span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/dolphin.jpg" data-lightview-caption="One of these stupid little bastards actually did bump into a rudder, and then it swam off in a hurry, no doubt sore and embarrassed." data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/dolphin.jpg" alt="/img/bigtrip/dolphin.jpg" ><br><span class="caption">One of these stupid little bastards actually did bump into a rudder, and then it swam off in a hurry, no doubt sore and embarrassed.</span></a>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://theskinnyonbenny.com/blog2/geofenced</guid><title>Geofenced</title><description>I encountered a technology this week that I haven't come across before.

Normally, that would be a source of great joy for me, but this time, not so much.</p><p>Theskinnyonbenny family went on our first full provisioning run in a couple of months. We're liquor-drinking Americans with two teenage boys, so we can set a grocery store's stockholders into fits of rapturous joy.</p><p>Yesterday, we had two carts full, a lot of which was heavy -- potatoes, cat litter, and bottles of water, beer, soft drinks, and I'm not even sure what else. I know we didn't have wine. We're still packed to the hilt with Croatian and Italian wine.</p><p>Our thought -- actually a suggestion that one of the other sailers in town made -- was to just walk the shopping carts from the store down to the dock. It's less than a 10 minute walk. Then, we would unload and bring the carts back.</p><p>When the first cart made it to the edge of the parking lot, one of its wheels locked up. V tried to shove harder, and it looked like it was fighting back. In a minute, all of the wheels were bricks.</p><p>The second cart got to about the same place and did the same thing. We realized that the shopping carts were somehow geofenced, and started lugging super heavy shopping bags in a series of trips.</p><p>Ko speculated that they must really have an issue with carts being taken by homeless people before almost immediately realizing that we haven't seen a single homeless person in Europe. Just imagine the time and expense of geofencing ones shopping carts. Now all of that just to prevent boaters from using them as dock carts.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://theskinnyonbenny.com/big-trip/biding-time</guid><title>Biding Time</title><description>A week and a half since my last post, and there's really not much new to report.

They have various degrees of convenience and amenities, but all of them are a step down when compared to our quarters aboard the boat.</p><p>We have mostly just been doing work, school, and streaming American TV. We wander the town, and we're a little tired of every bar and restaurant. We've come to know a healthy percentage of the local British population, just from happening to be seated near them at cocktail hour one night or another. Last Thursday, we went to a random going away party, and it happened to be an outgoing dog lover who had introduced herself to Rosie and then to the rest of us at a different place earlier in the stay.</p><p>The wind continues to blow us away, in both the literal and figurative senses. We turned the Pegasus crew loose to make their way home after they had worked around the clock for 10 days or so, leaving me to roll on a couple of coats of bottom paint. I did it in the wind, and the gale would lift sheets of paint up out of my paint tray and blow it over my head and face. Last Tuesday, I was too paint-covered to drop in and see my Scottish friend perform at the Irish Pub's open mic night.</p><p>Easter weekend brought our first real rain, and we huddled in our tiniest apartment to watch movies.

We stopped at Almiramar, where we had planned to stop for a day or two anyway. But instead of leaving, we went ahead and had the boat hauled out of the water for inspection. We found a problem with the potential to be quite serious.</p><p>The good people from Pegasus were on site to help in a day, and they sent a team of experts from their shop with a truck full of supplies immediately. There are three guys working every hour of daylight right now, and we're optimistic about getting back underway next week.</p><p>Meanwhile, we play tourist in Almiramar. There's a huge English-speaking contingent here, and everyone has been very nice. The town is basically a giant zig-zagging marina, surrounded by probably 3 miles of bars and restaurants, and then those surrounded by apartment buildings. There are lots of parks, and the weather is sunny and nice. Each end of town ends in a large beach, but the water is still pretty cold. We're getting a lot of work and school done. But that's about it: work/school, check on the boat, go for dinner and cocktails. There's really not a lot more to do.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240312_121353_IMG_2022.jpg" data-lightview-caption="I've definitely seen uglier boat yards." data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240312_121353_IMG_2022.jpg" alt="/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240312_121353_IMG_2022.jpg" ><br><span class="caption">I've definitely seen uglier boat yards.</span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240315_141800_D3093609-5AB6-4864-AE23-CADBFE324A11.jpg" data-lightview-caption="We rented an apartment for our stay.

It's like Miami, if a huge road construction project and windy, cool weather caused a lot of the businesses to close for a bit. You can get anything you want there -- boat services, Indian food, night club action, herpes (presumably). We found a place with excellent food and Sangria, and passed a pleasant few days waiting for a good weather window.</p><p>We chose to leave on a Friday night where the forecast was for 20 knot winds on our beam. It turned out to be a night with 25 knots on the bow, which is a much, much more unpleasant sailing experience. But we plowed through the night with a double-reefed main and a bit of jib flying, with winds gusting to 30.</p><p>The seas kicked up, and it was uncomfortable and annoying, We had some miscommunication about who was latching hatches, so it was also wetter inside the boat than it should be. The waves were enough to spray up over the cabin fairly regularly.</p><p>Here's how it looked from the chart table in the middle of the night. Volume up, if you're where you can.</p><iframe width="872" height="491" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uLhMsYtoRgQ" title="" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe><p>Around sunrise, I was just getting up to end my night watch, and the auto pilot went out. We were still 20 miles away from Ibiza, and the wind was still coming from the direction we needed at an insane speed. I started the motor, and we plowed into the chop, hand steering through the cold salt spay for four hours.</p><p>When we arrived, we found that the anchor had shaken loose in storm and pounded the shit out of our bow. Our formerly beautifully painted bow. The shaking had also ripped the door to the forwardmost cabin right out of its frame.<br><br>It's been cold and windy in Ibiza, which doesn't help with the frustration. But in just a few days, we've made a lot of progress on repairs and cleanup, and in a couple more days, we'll be able to move along. A fiberglass guy is going to patch us up "good enough" so that we can move on safely, and then when we're in a place that's warmer and cheaper, we can haul out to complete the repair, sanding, and painting.</p><p>Most of my latest pictures are close ups of hull damage and steering mechanisms. I didn't even make a snap on the way to the laundromat.</p><p>First, a few pics from Palma, Mallorca:</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240220_082117_IMG_1717.jpg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240220_082117_IMG_1717.jpg" alt="/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240220_082117_IMG_1717.jpg" ><br><span class="caption"></span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240220_083920_IMG_1718.jpg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240220_083920_IMG_1718.jpg" alt="/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240220_083920_IMG_1718.jpg" ><br><span class="caption"></span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240221_121846_IMG_1738.jpg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240221_121846_IMG_1738.jpg" alt="/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240221_121846_IMG_1738.jpg" ><br><span class="caption"></span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240221_124429_IMG_1741.jpg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240221_124429_IMG_1741.jpg" alt="/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240221_124429_IMG_1741.jpg" ><br><span class="caption"></span></a><p>x</p><p>And not much from Ibiza, but there was at least a nice sunset in the marina.<br><br><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240225_184530_IMG_1802.jpg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240225_184530_IMG_1802.jpg" alt="/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240225_184530_IMG_1802.jpg" ><br><span class="caption"></span></a></p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240225_184737_IMG_1804.jpg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240225_184737_IMG_1804.jpg" alt="/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240225_184737_IMG_1804.jpg" ><br><span class="caption"></span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240226_091330_IMG_1805.jpg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240226_091330_IMG_1805.jpg" alt="/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240226_091330_IMG_1805.jpg" ><br><span class="caption"></span></a><p>I'm not posting pictures of my damage just yet.

The marina in Riposto is right by where the the catch comes in every morning, and so just a block down and to the right is market after market of fresh fish right off the boat. We ate tuna and swordfish pretty much every day.</p><p>There was also good produce right there, along with butcher shops, bakeries, and miscellaneous stores with meats and cheeses. I suspect the neighborhood is still abuzz about how much food the American family with teenage boys bought while in town. One lady was shocked -- like, "are you sure you want that much?" -- when I ordered about a pound of mortadella.<br><br>One afternoon, after the fresh markets were closed and I was looking to stock up on wine, a car slowed down near me on the street.

We bashed into the wind all day. The sailing wasn't fun, so we tucked into a little cover on a small volcano north of Sicily and got a good night's sleep, followed by a great sail the next day. Another day yet, and we were to Sardinia.</p><p>We chose a marina in a quiet little town that is mostly shut down for the winter. We took a taxi into town and had a five-star meal, but other than that, it was mostly boat chores and laundry. Very pretty though, and it shows signs of being a happening place during the high season.</p><p>(Even more text after these pictures)</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_1681.jpeg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_1681.jpeg" alt="/img/bigtrip/resIMG_1681.jpeg" ><br><span class="caption"></span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_1682.jpeg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_1682.jpeg" alt="/img/bigtrip/resIMG_1682.jpeg" ><br><span class="caption"></span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_1699.jpeg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_1699.jpeg" alt="/img/bigtrip/resIMG_1699.jpeg" ><br><span class="caption"></span></a><p>Leaving on Saturday, we had ideal conditions for putting out the Code 0 (big, giant downwind sail at the very front of the boat). But I neglected to get any practice on closed-loop furlers, and as I pulled out sail, the furling mechanism was wrapping itself around the sail instead of just unfurling line like a drum furler would have. V and I went forward to get things untangled. but the wind had a good grip on the bit of the sail that had gotten let out. I asked for the boat to be steered into the wind so that the sail would luff, and when the boat turned, it went right over one of the sheets on that sail that was half deployed.</p><p>If you sailed to Cuba with us, or if you heard tales of our Cuba trip, this will sound familiar to you.</p><p>The line got caught in the prop (of course), which means no more motoring. We dropped the big sail to the deck and bungeed it into an ugly bundle. Then, under main sail alone, we sailed close to a pretty little beach and dropped anchor.</p><p>We had to find all of the components of the hookah dive system. I had secretly hoped to never use it again.</p><p>And the best advice that we got before leaving for this trip was to go buy a used wetsuit, just in case.</p><p>We got things sorted, and it took me forever to work up the nerve to swim under water. I kept going under and finding that I couldn't breathe. Eventually, it dawned on me that I was clenching my jaw so tight that I wasn't letting any air out.</p><p>The line wasn't on tight. I just had to unwrap it, maybe seven or eight times. I wasn't under the boat more than 75 seconds or so, probably, but I was nervous like I was diving a blue hole.</p><p>After that, we had a couple of drinks and enjoyed being anchored on a warm afternoon. Then, we put all of the gear back away, wrestled the sail and tangled lines into storage, and set off again. I'm tying this at 4:00 AM local time, and our beautiful weather window is over. There's no wind out here at all.</p><p>At some point, I'll do some technical videos about our sail rigging, but I have a lot left to learn first.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_9013.jpeg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_9013.jpeg" alt="/img/bigtrip/resIMG_9013.jpeg" ><br><span class="caption"></span></a>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://theskinnyonbenny.com/big-trip/underway</guid><title>Underway</title><description>We shove off and set sail for home.</description><link>https://theskinnyonbenny.com/big-trip/underway</link><pubDate>Tue, 6 Feb 2024 14:31:00 -0600</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On Saturday morning, we finished buttoning up the boat, motored to the Izola fuel dock, and then motored over to the nearby town of Portrose to officially export the boat from Slovenia.

We had chartered similar boats, and we were excited to do some coastal cruising on our own schedule. As we grew our confidence, we started overnight passages and then venturing farther and farther offshore. And we might have sailed it a bit harder than she was meant to be sailed. Not in a dangerous way, but in the way of robustness.</p><p>I see that clearly now that we've moved aboard Hazagussa, the red Pegasus that you saw briefly in the last post. The Pegasus components -- sailing hardware especially, but pumps, hatches, and all sorts of minor pieces too look and feel so much bigger and sturdier.</p><p>The list of things that I never had to troubleshoot, replace, or repair on the Beneteau is as follows:</p><ul><li>any of the winches</li><li>water heater</li><li>a little pump at the bottom of the freezer to remove meltwater. However, the freezer was broken as often as not, so this pump didn't get put through the paces like the rest of the boat.</li></ul><p>So it's a little bit funny that the boat thing I've done most since we moved aboard is troubleshoot the water heater.</p><p>For most of us, it's not a big deal, because we're at the dock, and hot showers are a short walk away.<br><br>But I don't think I've written yet that one of our capable and able crew, namely Heather, is somewhat less capable with a broken ankle. The marina has accommodated us by allowing us to pull side-to on a long floating dock rather than make her try to cross a gangway. But getting on and off is an adventure, and it's not been the best weather, so she opted for an ice water shower.</p><p>Other than the hot water thing, living aboard again is so great. The salon is big and full of light, and we're all in here without being on top of each other during the rainy days. The cat has find a way to squirm under the salon table, and he has himself a little spot that floats him above strands of cabling. We'll have to put a blanket in that spot for him on Velvet Elvis.</p><p>We even cooked home made food yesterday for the first time since we arrived.</p><p>As I write, it's blowing out there:</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/IMG_20240119_112555_IMG_1315.jpg" data-lightview-caption="This shows that in the last hour, the average wind speed has been 19 kts, with gusts up to about 32." data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/IMG_20240119_112555_IMG_1315.jpg" alt="/img/bigtrip/IMG_20240119_112555_IMG_1315.jpg" ><br><span class="caption">This shows that in the last hour, the average wind speed has been 19 kts, with gusts up to about 32.</span></a><iframe width="1034" height="582" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aeep-JfdU-g" title="" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/IMG_20240119_100038_IMG_1314.jpg" data-lightview-caption="This is one of my favorite pictures that I've ever taken.

We're looking at some time next week before she's in the water, and then there's still a lot to do before we can put Slovenia behind us. But that's the nature of travel, and in particular of sailing. We definitely want everything to be right on the boat first.</p><p>We've gotten to go to the shop and do a lot of technical learning, and seeing how everything is being assembled is invaluable. And we have a company where the owners know where every wire is run and every hose is plumbed, and they seem eager to stay on the phone with us and get us where we want to be when we want to be there. Better yet, they know where to go in the Med and where to skip. It will be great to have them as a remote team helping us from shore.</p><p>We also met the owner of hull 9, <strong>Sine Finis</strong> which launched last week. Nice guy. He's going to leave it here and let us import into the US before following later in the year. I'm sure we'll see hime again.</p><p>Continuing the bad news, we've all been fighting a mild sickness. Fucking air travel. The up side of that is that we just sleep in our rental place, which I've named "the world's most dismal apartment." Tomorrow is move out day. I'll leave the details about where we're going for later in the week.<br><br>My pictures are a weird mix of tourist and technical. Here's a pretty mountain. Here's a compressor for the cockpit refrigerator. Here's the dog looking cute on a Pegasus that is not our Pegasus. I'm a bit at a loss for what to post.</p><p>I think I'm going to do some technical walk-through videos for the real nerds out there once we're aboard our own boat, so I'll save some of those pictures for then.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/slovenia-01-01.jpg" data-lightview-caption="How's that for a transom?" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/slovenia-01-01.jpg" alt="/img/slovenia-01-01.jpg" ><br><span class="caption">How's that for a transom?</span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/slovenia-01-02.jpg" data-lightview-caption="Doing school work in the cool little coffe shop next door to The World's Most Dismal Apartment™️" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/slovenia-01-02.jpg" alt="/img/slovenia-01-02.jpg" ><br><span class="caption">Doing school work in the cool little coffe shop next door to The World's Most Dismal Apartment™️</span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/slovenia-01-03.jpg" data-lightview-caption="Izola is a really pretty town." data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/slovenia-01-03.jpg" alt="/img/slovenia-01-03.jpg" ><br><span class="caption">Izola is a really pretty town.</span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/slovenia-01-04.jpg" data-lightview-caption="Rosie the Boat Dog isn't so sure about using the passerelle to get ashore." data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/slovenia-01-04.jpg" alt="/img/slovenia-01-04.jpg" ><br><span class="caption">Rosie the Boat Dog isn't so sure about using the passerelle to get ashore.</span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/slovenia-01-05.jpg" data-lightview-caption="Velvet Elvis's keel" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/slovenia-01-05.jpg" alt="/img/slovenia-01-05.jpg" ><br><span class="caption">Velvet Elvis's keel</span></a>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://theskinnyonbenny.com/big-trip/game-plan</guid><title>Game Plan</title><description>It's almost go time.

Boat school continues with combinations of visits to the boat yard and on board a sister ship in the marina at Izola.</p><p>Jan 12: Keel arrives at boat yard from the keel manufacturer. Ours is the first Pegasus with the shoal draft keel. This delivery is somewhat delayed, but the good folks at Pegasus are planning to keep it in the shop and do its prep work over the weekend.</p><p>Jan 15: Transport the boat to the ocean. This should be a big day with some good pictures.</p><p>Jan 16th &amp; 17th: Install keel, step the mast, install rigging, and get the boat into the water. Maybe not in that order.</p><p>Once the boat's in the water, we can start unloading the pallets of our stuff that we shipped up there and moving into the boat. We can also get to the starlink dish at this point and get it installed. We also start a series of test sails where we make sure everything is working, instruments are calibrated, etc.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://theskinnyonbenny.com/blog2/unseasonal-decorations</guid><title>Unseasonal Decorations</title><description>Now that I don't have to get a kid up and make him get ready for school, I can start my mornings with long walks with the dog.

Put them up once in early October, apply a minor tweak on the first weekend of November, and then leave it alone until early January. Soooo much less up-and-down with boxes of decorations.</p><p>I hereby challenge all decorations manufacturers to make things like this ubiquitous. Lights are obvious. One switch for orange. Flip it in November for white or red or green or blue It seems like fake spider webs could become fake snow banks pretty easily. Werewolves that become reindeer.

Photo unrelated to this story for the most part...</span></a><p>It's a painstaking task. I arrow-down one by one through about 10,000 pictures we take over the course of a year, and pick the best few hundred to include. I let the web site arrange them, but then I have to go in and move things around, group them more logically, and give more prominence to better pictures. I'm usually doing this at 2:00 in the morning.</p><p>One of the pictures I selected from after my Dec. 2022 cutoff date as a picture that my whole family took at my dad's graduation. He had finished up his PHD in music composition. Either by going with the auto-generated placement or by accidentally doing a small drag with the mouse, I absolutely botched the placement of this one.<br><br>I cut my dad (the graduate) out of the picture, but left in his advisor, who is just a total random stranger to all of the rest of us.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/botched-portrait.png" data-lightview-caption="That's Dad's graduation robe, over to the left." data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/botched-portrait.png" alt="/img/botched-portrait.png" width="650px"><br><span class="caption">That's Dad's graduation robe, over to the left.</span></a><p><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/greenline.gif" class="greenline" alt="{{divider}}" /></p><p>The week before Christmas, I baked some Christmas cookies. One of my favorites has been a fig cookie, where I make a filling of mixed figs, raisons, brandy, sugar, chopped nuts, and spices, roll it into a tube, surround that with cookie dough, slice into pieces, and bake.</p><p>I don't know what I did wrong on this one, but my dough was very close to being a batter instead. I ended up having trouble shaping the cookies, and then for some reason, I had a lot of leftover filling.</p><p>I found that I could roll the filling into the size and shape of one of Rosie's turds, and it would look 100% authentic. Then, I spent two days where everyone who would come over would have to see me swear about the dog turd on the floor, followed by me picking it up bare-handed and finally taking a bite.</p><p>I didn't take a picture, and I don't even deserve to have a web site any more.</p><p>The best reaction I got was from V, whose eyes went wide with shock when I picked up the fake turd. Once I took a bite, he laughed and called me a jerk. The bite really gave up the prank. I should have tossed it in the trash and then absent-mindedly licked my fingers.</p><p><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/greenline.gif" class="greenline" alt="{{divider}}" /></p><p>Listen to some of my dad's music:</p><iframe style="border: 0; width: 350px; height: 470px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2357875700/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/transparent=true/" seamless><a href="https://danschultz.bandcamp.com/album/selected-compositions">Selected Compositions by Dan Schultz</a></iframe><p>I'll add that you should listen more than once.

"But it's their hooooooommmmmmee," you whine. I can hear you. Outside of sailing forums, the people tend to be on the side of the orcas. The New York Times article about this week's sinking ends with this thought:</p><blockquote>But the ocean is the orcas’ home, and conservationists say scaring the animals is not a solution.
<br /><br />
“It is not about winning a battle, because this is not a war,” Mr. López said. “We need to be respectful.”</blockquote><p>So we don't see eye-to-eye.</p><p>A strategy that seems to be working is keeping to shallower water. No attacks have been recorded in depths less than about 60 feet. So we do that over there for sure.</p><p>We'll also crank up the human noises, to be as unpleasant as possible.</p><p>Oh, and that might be a good time to dump the cat's litter box. Orcas can't possibly want cat shit in their blow holes.</p><p>("Cat Shit in Their Blow Holes" is not a bad band name. You can have it for free.)</p><p>I also have this idea that if they come to our rudders, I switch to full-throttle reverse. First, if they're approaching from the stern, and the boat passes their head, they have to circle around to get back to them. Orcas don't have reverse, do they?</p><p>Second, in reverse, the motion of the boat and the suction of the prop are going to pull the orca toward the prop. They're too strong to suck them in to the prop and hurt them, but it might well be annoying.</p><p>But hopefully, we don't see the orcas at all.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://theskinnyonbenny.com/blog2/travel-update-site-update-social-butterfly</guid><title>Travel Update, Site Update, Social Butterfly</title><description>There are a lot of upcoming changes to the site, as I still try to get all of the old stuff re-posted.

It's a punishment-proof way to vape, since no one will question that scent coming out of a restroom stall.</p><p>If either of us had any ambition, we'd be rich by now.</p><p>On a technical note, I don't think I've ever embedded an instagram post before, and the amount of text in their embed code is staggering. I bet half of this page that you're seeing is embed code. Probably a bunch of stuff that links you and me together in the algorithms, which is why every time you log on to the internet for the next couple of weeks, you'll see ads for Truck Nutz.</p><p>Update: all of that code just rendered a white rectangle with a link in the middle to take you off-page. I can do links myself, thank you very much.

For example,</p><ul>
	<li>One night last week, I wanted crab cakes for dinner.</li>
    <li>This Summer, I very much wanted to win the mega millions.  Or powerball -- whichever was up close to a billion dollar jackpot.</li>
    <li>Also this Summer, I wanted to see a moose.</li>
    <li>On Sunday, I wanted the Saints not to blow a game where they had a 17 point lead in the fourth quarter.</li>
    <li>My youthful notions of winning a Hiesman trophy or Nobel Peace Prize (not even being picky about which) are in the rearview mirror.</li>
</ul><p>But I've never wanted anything as much as my little dog wants to catch a squirrel.</p><p>On Monday, I took her with me to work from a patio where I like to get coffee and start my day sometimes. A young, skinny squirrel came by, and it's either rabid, stupid, or the bravest little thing who hasn't learned that dogs are threats. And it made Rosie absolutely crazy.</p><p>Rosie nearly pulled the table over several times, one of which you can see in the embedded video. Then, the squirrel found a croissant that didn't quite make the trash can, and it was in heaven.<br><br><div class="embed-featured"><iframe width="837" height="471" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FSBJy92gEq0" title="Squirrel" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></p><p><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/greenline.gif" class="greenline" alt="{{divider}}" /></p><p>Unrelated, other than this is the next video in the camera roll was the annual fall firing of the hatch peppers.</p><div class="embed-featured"><iframe width="664" height="374" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mznCBKqoYRA" title="Firing the Peppers" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p>Not much to see really, other than the sheer power of propane + flame.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://theskinnyonbenny.com/blog2/master-motivator-beaglo-wild-wings-night-market</guid><title>Master Motivator, Beaglo Wild Wings, Night Market</title><description>It didn't seem like an eventful weekend, but here I am with a post of full of words and pictures from Friday and Saturday.</description><link>https://theskinnyonbenny.com/blog2/master-motivator-beaglo-wild-wings-night-market</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Sep 2023 15:03:00 -0500</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On Friday, we had a happy hour scheduled with Mrs. theskinnyonbenny's office.

I got 35 minutes into episode one.  Good thing I'm here to tell you what's wrong.</description><link>https://theskinnyonbenny.com/blog2/who-cares-about-erin-carter</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Sep 2023 16:02:00 -0500</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One night this week, I started watching <a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/81587808" target="_blank">Who is Erin Carter</a> on Netflix, and I've got to tell you, I have never seen a more sloppily-written piece of television.</p><p>I got 35 minutes into episode one.</p><p>The writers think that this makes sense:</p><p>The main lady has a daughter, and that daughter beat up a kid at school. Let's call him bloody-lip. So we start a scene where main character mom goes to bloody-lip's house to talk to bloody-lip's parents. He tells us that his dad is out of town, and that his mom is around back having a tennis lesson. Main character mom walks around back and spys the other mom banging the tennis instructor.</p><p>And after that, they all go to school for that morning.<br><br>So their universe is bathed in broad daylight at like 6:00 AM, everyone is up, and the mom has a tennis lesson/sexual liaison scheduled for that early on a school day.</p><p>After school <em>on that very same day</em>, she goes back to that house for a giant party. In the course of the school day, they've set up the yard with tables and chairs, put up a huge stage with lights for live musicians, and had a giant nude sculpture of tennis-banging-mom carved from a block of ice.<br><br><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/penelope.jpg" data-lightview-caption="The company that sets up parties in this town does a killer job." data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/penelope.jpg" alt="/img/penelope.jpg" width="650px"><br><span class="caption">The company that sets up parties in this town does a killer job.</span></a></p><p>Then, they have 200 people over for a shindig when the husband is either still <em>out of town</em> or has just gotten back.</p><p>This is the worst example, but the dialog is full of things that real people wouldn't say. The acting isn't what you would call good, but it wouldn't be something I noticed if the writing wasn't so sloppy.</p><p>I'm sure twists and turns are coming. (Obviously, there's something to the girl's glasses. They beat you over the head that the mom gets her panties in a bunch if the girl takes them off.)</p><p>The best part for me is the song that the title put in my head. The song isn't in the show (at least not in the first 35 minutes), but I can hear it in my brain any time.<br><br>Erin Carter Erin Carter Erin Carter... Ooooooooohhh SHIT, Erin Carter.</p><p>If you've watched to the end, go ahead and spoil it for me.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://theskinnyonbenny.com/blog2/praising-the-lord-at-cirlcle-k</guid><title>Praising the Lord At Circle K</title><description>A bunch of nonsense about getting a drink at Circle K and then going to work from the library.

I had just been up a long time, finished my coffee, and wanted something cold to drink so I could sit outside to start my work day. I like sometimes to sit on the plaza outside of the main library. There is shade, power outlets, a steady trickle of people to watch, and a fountain for background white noise.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/work20230908.jpg" data-lightview-caption="At the library this morning." data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/work20230908.jpg" alt="/img/work20230908.jpg" width="650px"><br><span class="caption">At the library this morning.</span></a><p>But it's still so hot outside, even at 8:00 AM. So I need a drink.</p><p>While adding ice to the cup, there was a woman next to me filling her. She sounded very much like Aunt Esther from Sanford and Son when she exclaimed, "Thank you, Jesus!"</p><p>I was briefly possessed by Larry David. "I've got to ask... What is it with the coke machine here that's bringing you so much joy?"</p><p>I was expecting something like "there's been no syrup in the Dr Pepper dispenser for three days and now there is" or something like that.</p><p>But I got, "I'm just happy that God thought I should wake up this morning."</p><p>I guess, yeah, being alive hits for me too.</p><p>She started walking to the registers talking to herself about being alive, and that's what really answered my question: crazy.</p><p>If you have to be crazy, crazy and happy to be alive beats the shit out of crazy with demons. Last time I worked on the library's patio, I didn't stay long, because a guy behind me was ranting at an imaginary enemy. He repeated, "You're just a broke motherfucker. You about about to be a dead motherfucker." If he wasn't behind my back, he wouldn't have been scary, but then again, I didn't want to look up and make eye contact with him either. Color me as a guy who wants to stay on the "broke motherfucker" side of his ledger.</p><p>Getting back to Circle-K, the new robot check out things are the best new invention of 2023. Just stick your things under the hood, swipe the phone over the keypad, and you're out. No scanning, no nothing. I was out of the store while thankful-to-be-alive lady was still trying to pay.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/circle-k-scanner.jpg" data-lightview-caption="The new Circle K scanner." data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/circle-k-scanner.jpg" alt="/img/circle-k-scanner.jpg" width="650px"><br><span class="caption">The new Circle K scanner.</span></a>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://theskinnyonbenny.com/blog2/nothing-going-on-its-just-fucking-hot</guid><title>Nothing Going On, It's Just Fucking Hot</title><description>I went to look for hurricane coverage this morning and found to my surprise, that Hulu live has The Weather Channel now.

It's a nice break, because it's been as hot as it's ever been. This is rough for me. I'm not getting younger or skinnier.</p><p>The weekend was absolutely brutal. I went to pick up my temporarily (I'm sure) repaired Jeep, and I found North Louisiana to be full of hazy smoke. In the afternoon, we tried to sit outside and watch football, but it was just unbearable, even in the shade and the fans on. We went in and cooked all evening, like we do when it's too cold to be outside.</p><p>On Sunday morning, I could smell the smoke when I stepped outside. I drove early to Slidell, and the wildfire smoke just east of Baton Rouge was even worse than the smoke from the day before. I had to haul some heavy stuff from back where the boats are to my temporarily-repaired Jeep, and the heat had me wheezing. I was about an inch from puking. When I was finished, I checked the temperature, and it was 106. Definitely the hottest weather I've ever tried to be active in. And hopefully, the hottest ever again.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/smoky.jpg" data-lightview-caption="Sunday morning was smoky as hell just outside of Baton Rouge." data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/smoky.jpg" alt="/img/smoky.jpg" width="650px"><br><span class="caption">Sunday morning was smoky as hell just outside of Baton Rouge.</span></a><p>After that, there was a Krewe of Lyonesse pool party.

It saves me an hour in the morning, with a shorter drive, but more importantly, with not getting stuck in a neighborhood with two ways in and out along with 1000 other parents trying to drive the same roads at the same time.</p><p>It changes up my routine. There's a coffee shop two blocks away, and I've been going there a lot of mornings to start my work day. I've come to like the regulars. There's a samall group of dudes who seem to span every race, age, and income level who sit out there, smoke cigars, and yuck it up starting at 8:00 am. When there's no one at the counter, the staff is out there with us too.</p><p>I'm down there early enough to park alongside the curb right in front of the store. I have yet to pay the newly-installed parking meters down there. We all know that the ticket writers here don't work in bad weather, and it's hotter than the devil's taint out here, even that early in the morning.</p><p>After working for a few hours today, I had the table covered with laptops, an ipad where I was making notes, my phone (the <a href="https://knowledgefight.libsyn.com/841-like-a-pearl-before-a-swine" target="_blank">Kowledge Fight podcast today</a> was a lot of fun), and my coffee. I was about 20 minutes into a Teams call for work, and I saw the meter maid working his way up the street.</p><p>It was instantly a mad scramble. I was stuffing shit into my bag willy-nilly, sloshing coffee all over myself. My hurried hands couldn't find the dexterity to untie the dog from the table, and when I was finally into a position to bolt, I nearly darted out in front of a car and killed the dog and me both. Rather be dead than have a $20 ticket, apparently.</p><p>By the fact that I had time to type this out, you may have already concluded that I lived. And, I did not get a ticket. And, my call was on mute, so it all happened with my colleagues blissfully unaware.</p><p>I would love to know what the cigar-smoking regulars thought of my mad dash.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://theskinnyonbenny.com/blog2/driving-blues</guid><title>Driving Blues</title><description>It's been a lot of driving lately.

Camp pickup wasn't until 10:00. We left from there and drove until the wee hours. 11 states, and it was all bumper to bumper traffic from Maine through New Jersey. Around sunset, it the traffic got better. From Northern Virginia to home was another really long slog, fed by Red Bull and Twizzlers, which leaves you feeling shitty for a couple of days from there.</p><p>Then -- I don't know if you've heard about this -- it's hot as hell in the south right now.</p><p>Last weekend, it was up and back to Natchitoches to get our cars and our parents' cars back where they belong, but the issue that lead us to abandon my truck for the summer trip had returned, so it's still in the shop up there. Our weekends are kind of busy right now, so I've got to find a window to sneak in another round trip to retrieve it.</p><p>And then it will be my dream vehicle for a month before the engine starts to misfire again. Mark my words.</p><p>Speaking of heat, don't force the Instant Pot open when there's still a little pressure in there. I did that last week, and here's the burn still looks today. Don't fuck around with that!</p><p>Never mind -- I'm not posting that image, but picture a grizzly red, flaky burn on a fat pale belly. No one needs that haunting their sleep</p><p>And now that we've broken the seal on pictures (at least in our midns) check out these ladies, roughly 30 years apart.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/beforeAndAfter.jpg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/beforeAndAfter.jpg" alt="/img/beforeAndAfter.jpg" width="650px"><br><span class="caption"></span></a><p>I typed out and deleted a line about their good looks (both now and in the 90s), but I feel like a giant creep sitting at my table at the age of 51, commenting on the looks of girls in their early 20s.

I'd like the feedback as to whether this is gross as hell, not that big a deal but still a bad look, or absolutely fine. Leave me a note in the comments.</p><p>Just kidding. Comments are gone too.

I thought she was yapping at a couple of kids who happened to be bicycling past and told her to hush.

I moved to a site kind of far away, hoping that the bear would take advantage of the calm to go find another hangout.</p><p>Once I got started again, Rosie let out a growl and her eyes went from my left to my right, looking behind me. I looked over my shoulder to see the bear running away down a trail to my right. It had passed right behind me, and I didn't hear a thing over the rushing water next to me.<br><br>I'm glad it wasn't hungry for an old fat guy.</p>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
