I was the guy watching every pitch of February series against colleges that I'd never heard of. I watched great wins that took until the wee hours of the morning, and I saw the Tigers play some pretty rough series on the road during conference play.</p><p>I had some kind of digestive bug that was too gross for me to get into here, and then I added pnemonia to the mix, and all of that stirred around with my middle aged immune system and turned to sepsis. The day after the championship, I couldn't really walk, make sentences, or work simple sail controls.</p><a class="lightview alignright" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/basball-championship-8.jpeg" data-lightview-caption="Congrats to the Tigers!" data-lightview-group="group1" ><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/basball-championship-8.jpeg" alt="/img/basball-championship-8.jpeg"><br><span class="caption">Congrats to the Tigers!</span></a><p>Nassau was a five hour sail away, but getting to a nearer island with an airport, finding a flight, and getting to the hospital from there was probably just as long an ordeal. Mrs. theskinnyonbenny's inner kick-ass captain took over, and she found a place to dock and a ride to the hospital while handling all of the boat piloting solo.</p><p>There's much of that trip that my brain has lost, but I won't soon forget her docking. She was at the wheel, looking over her shoulder, screaming at the dock hands, "I'VE NEVER DONE THIS BEFORE," while backig perfectly into a slip meant for a mega-yacht.</p><p>Within a few hours, the hospital had knocked my fever down and given me a strong dose of IV antibiotics. My brain fog cleared over the course of a night in the ER, and in the morning, I was moved to an actual hospital room.</p><p>Shout out to Dr Dionne Dames, who was so amazing and kind that I'm thinking of flying to Nassau any time I feel under the weather.</p><p>It seemed much longer, but four days later, I got my release. It was Friday, and Crystal, Camilla, and Annika were flying in on Saturday to tour the best of the Exumas from the luxurious quarters on Velvet Elvis.</p><a class="lightview alignright" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img//gal/197%20-%20Bahamas%20and%20Keys%202025/resIMG_20250628_192058_IMG_0636.jpg" data-lightview-caption="Big boat neighbors" data-lightview-group="group1" ><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img//gal/197%20-%20Bahamas%20and%20Keys%202025/resIMG_20250628_192058_IMG_0636.jpg" alt="/img//gal/197 - Bahamas and Keys 2025/resIMG_20250628_192058_IMG_0636.jpg"><br><span class="caption">Big boat neighbors</span></a><p>I made them nervous at first. Too tired to join them for lunch, they left me aboard. Crystal commented, "He looks really pale." It was just sunscreen, applied liberally over my naturally red face.</p><p>Our crew on Velvet Elvis can give a pretty good Exumas trip at this point. The Pegasus really reduces the time spent between islands, so we were able to go somewhere cool every day. Here's a quick recap, in case you're planning your own trip.</p><p>Norman's Cay: A couple of cool tropical bars/restaurants. Seatings were booked up, but we got to have cocktails. There's a cool plane in shallow water to snorkel around.</p><a class="lightview alignright" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img//gal/197%20-%20Bahamas%20and%20Keys%202025/resIMG_20250629_175818_IMG_5196%25202.jpg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1" ><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img//gal/197%20-%20Bahamas%20and%20Keys%202025/resIMG_20250629_175818_IMG_5196%25202.jpg" alt="/img//gal/197 - Bahamas and Keys 2025/resIMG_20250629_175818_IMG_5196%202.jpg"><br><span class="caption"></span></a><p>Shroud Cay: One of my favorite places in the world. We didn't get the bright sun that makes it look almost fake, but we motored up mangrove-lind streams and spotted sharks and a sea turtle. Ending on the other side, we had clear water and a beach to ourselves.</p><p>O'Brien's Cay: There's a great snorkeling spot, with tons and tons of fish and coral, and then right around a corner is a perfect sand bar, where you can stand there like it's a two-acre swimming pool. Bring an ice chest full of beer and spend half a day there.</p><p>Staniel Cay: The original beach for swimming with pigs, Thunderball Grotto (another of my favorite places), and Staniel Cay yacht club.</p><p>When we were at SCYC in 2021, we met a lady who just happened to live near Crystal, and her son. They were fun, and we hung out for a couple of days. And would you believe that they were there again? That's the universe telling us that we should hang out sometimes.</p><a class="lightview alignright" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img//gal/197%20-%20Bahamas%20and%20Keys%202025/resIMG_20250703_193123_IMG_0305.jpg" data-lightview-caption="All of us + renewed friends at Black Point

I was on the toilet.</p><p>This is last Saturday. Crystal and Camilla were at the house for a short visit, and I had finished my business. We have the toilet seat add on bidets installed, so I turned the knob to give my butthole a good rinse. Once satisfied, I turned it back, but instead of shutting off the water, the knob came off in my hand.</p><p>I reached down for the toilet's water shut off, but it was just out of reach.</p><p>I went ahead and flushed, and then I called for Mrs. theskinnyonbenny. She in turn sent Ko, and then he was leery about coming into the toilet area.</p><a class="lightview alignright" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/sceneofthecrime.jpg" data-lightview-caption="Scene of the crime" data-lightview-group="group1" ><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/sceneofthecrime.jpg" alt="/img/sceneofthecrime.jpg"><br><span class="caption">Scene of the crime</span></a><p>"What"</p><p>"You have to come all the way in.

By the time he got in and to the shutoff valve, it was even longer. And then the knob turned, but the water didn't shut off. It was just slipping around the nut without actually turning the valve inside the pipe. So my butthole flush continued.</p><p>I finally decided that I needed to get up. I had Ko move the hamper out of the immediate area, as things other than my backside were about to get really wet. I darted as quickly as I could, and the spray arched out of the bowl and hit the tile wall across from the toilet.</p><p>And then I couldn't find any pliers that would turn the bidet knob. V was home, and he had something in his car that worked well. But meanwhile, a geyser spewed forth from the toilet bowl onto the wall.</p><p>I joked that if there's anyone that ever wanted to do butt stuff with me, it would be a good day to give it a try.<br><br>Previously, the cleanest my anus ever got was when I could foul a hotel washcloth and get up in there in a manner that I would never do with my own.

I translated it in my mind and communicated to Clay that it was at "some place that teenage girls go to ride horses." The Jefferson Highway address made me think that it was way out in the sticks, but it was at the Witter place -- a big farm right in the middle of Baton Rouge's most prime real estate. Clay's back yard borders it, and it's just a few minutes away for me.</p><p>That place has always been mysterious to me, and I was looking forward to going up into the grounds to explore.</p><p>We drove up a long windy driveway, through pretty grounds. There are lots of out buildings. We didn't see the main house, but I have a clue about where it is.</p><p>The boil was at some sort of "arena" for horses. I'm sure there's a real word for that, but I'm not sure what it is. Next to the arena was a big stable house, with brick flooring and a chandelier. The horses are living large in there.</p><p>Crawfish photos now, and then there's some more about Sunday.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/IMG_20250426_174423_IMG_4905.jpg" data-lightview-caption="Boil Crew member Lee checks out all of the crawfish from the competition.

Our day out there is pretty much a routine now.</p><p>We start at Jackson Square. The attraction there is the roasted duck po-boy, and almost every year, I sit there enjoying the food but worry that I'm missing a better show on a different stage. This year, we were watching Don Vappie, and he was pretty entertaining. Double winner.</p><p>From there, we went to the cajun stage and watched the Lemon Spots, who were also a lot of fun. This stage is great, but it's on a huge hot asphalt lot. If they would just cover the whole lot in straw or something, it would be 15 degrees more comfortable out there. While here, we got a killer chicken sandwich.<br><br>I saw some turkey legs that were gigantic, roasted and smokey smelling. They had been split along the bone and filled with shrimp in some sort of creamy sauce. It was enough food for a giant, and has to be the best deal at the festival.</p><p>Bunch of pics...</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/IMG_4896.jpeg" data-lightview-caption="The pink full moon or whatever it was from Friday night.

They also sent her one with a threat to charge $200 for a pressure wash of a simple little brick wall.</p><p><em>This</em> is a neighborhood in need of some teenagers breaking car windows to steal change, phone chargers, and Creedance casette tapes.</p><h4>Exhibit 2</h4><p>Earlier in the week, <a href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/blog2/birthday-party/">I used this space to talk about my nephew’s birthday party</a>.

Neither was LSU, but I've gone from LSU baseball fan to general college baseball fan, and I'm watching games just to see how good teams are, just like I would watch a Bills/Ravens Monday night game in October.</p><a class="lightview alignright" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/2baseballgames.jpg" data-lightview-caption="Starting the night at the ballparks." data-lightview-group="group1" ><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/2baseballgames.jpg" alt="/img/2baseballgames.jpg"><br><span class="caption">Starting the night at the ballparks.</span></a><p>But I wasn't so in to it that I wasn't going to flip to Apple TV and watch the Season 2 finale of Severance. But I've also been a huge huge fan of The Pitt, and I saw a post from a TV reviewer saying that that night's episode was the best of them all. I messaged him to ask what I should watch first.</p><p>Seriously, quit now. There's a shocking twist 2/3 of the way through Season 1, and I'm going to spoil it.</p><p>(I did not include the Alabama/Tennessee baseball game in my list of what to watch, because I don't want this internet stranger to think I am insane.)</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/IMG_4850.jpeg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/IMG_4850.jpeg" alt="/img/IMG_4850.jpeg"><br><span class="caption"></span></a><p>So at 8:00, I went in to the house and started watching Severance. But what made this viewing particularly fun is that just as it was starting, V came into the room, plopped into a chair, and started watching with me. He has never seen one second of Severance. It was much like watching with a newly-created innie.</p><p>From here, I'm going to get spoilery, so now is the time to bail out if you're not current and plan to watch the show. And you definitely should plan to watch the show.</p><p>The episode starts with Mark Scout and Mark S having a conversation via video recorder. So I gave a quick explanation about how had two distinct personalities inside his one body with their own experience, etc. He was along for the ride.</p><p>Then, we got to the weird office stuff at Lumon. While we long-time viewers were enthralled by the appearance of Jame on the severed floor, V was basically where we were when we went with Helly to the severed floor for the first time.</p><p>"They have that giant room for two desks right together?"</p><p>"Wait -- their job is just to hover over numbers all day and then click on them?"</p><p>The next thing we knew, Milcheck was sprinting out of the office (which was the funniest moment of the whole series to me), and coming in to do a comedy bit with an animatronic old guy. We both marveled at this new, bizarre celebration. No sooner did we get through that than the whole big room -- which has never had more than six people in it -- was filled with a giant marching band.<br><br><a class="lightview alignright" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/21severance1-articleLarge.jpg" data-lightview-caption="I would love to have gotten some more screen shots.

I love watching his moves so much. If Dancing With the Stars casts Tramell Tillman, I'm back in for the first time in years.</p><p>After the marching band in the office bit, V got to enjoy a lot of action sequence stuff that didn't require a lot of exposition from me.<br><br>Once we got to the Mark/Gemma reunion, my explanations had to go in overdrive. In quick succession, Mark Scout (covered in blood) had to coax a new Gemma innie into the hall, where she immediately became original Gemma. They got into the elevator, went into an embrace, and before I could finish the explanation, "oh God, they're about to turn into co-workers who don't know each other very well" it was Mark S and Ms. Casey.</p><p>Ms. Casey's, "What is occurring?" when she found herself smooching a blood-soaked co-worker was the second funniest moment in the series.</p><p>When they got to the stairwell door, I quickly explained one last switch, where Ms. Casey became Gemma again, but this time looking at Mark S instead of Mark Scout.</p><p>I can't imagine that V followed all of that. Just trying to type it has my head spinning.</p><p>But it was a really fun way to watch the episode.</p><p>I also stayed up to watch The Pitt, which was as excellent as advertised. I didn't pick up the baseball final scores until the next day.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://theskinnyonbenny.com/blog2/art</guid><title>Art</title><description>There's an art shop in my neighborhood.

I have them wired to a smart plug, so with just a couple of phone taps, we can have the dark yard bathed in a warm light that also highlights our awesome trees.</p><p>After our <a href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/big-trip">trip</a>, none of the lights worked.

For the last couple of months, turning on the lights lit the arbor, but that's it.</p><p>This weekend, I pulled out all of the old lights and replaced them again. This time, I bathed each strand in a liquid repellant that smelled like wintergreen life savers. Once I had them all strung up, I deployed some little packets of repellant.</p><p>First, I went to the instructions, which only made me feel stupid:</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/directions.jpg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/directions.jpg" alt="/img/directions.jpg"><br><span class="caption"></span></a><p>So I opened the package.

All of the extra followers who picked up my feed while we crossed the Atlantic, so it's just us friends now, right?</p><p>When I wrote about our stay in Dominica, I mentioned some of the stuff we saw, but I didn't give much detail about the people. The night we arrived, we met a local who went by the name Yella, who spent a long time showing us cool things to see and do on the island from his phone's photo collection. So soon after, we spent a long day with him showing us around. I just did a quick search, and my only mention of Yella was in a caption on a photo, and I'm sure no one even ever noticed it. He took us to a lot of sights and waterfalls, gave us interesting information.</p><p>He also smoked pot absolutely nonstop.</p><a class="lightview alignright" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/gal/187%2520-%2520Martinique%2520and%2520Dominica/resIMG_20240522_154050_GPTempDownload%2520_7_.jpg" data-lightview-caption="Yella leads us to a waterfall." data-lightview-group="group1" style="width:350px;"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/gal/187%2520-%2520Martinique%2520and%2520Dominica/resIMG_20240522_154050_GPTempDownload%2520_7_.jpg" alt="/img/gal/187%20-%20Martinique%20and%20Dominica/resIMG_20240522_154050_GPTempDownload%20_7_.jpg"><br><span class="caption">Yella leads us to a waterfall.</span></a><p>He had a friend driving us -- a guy who had a massive set of dreadlocks stuffed up into one of those colorful knit hats. I asked Yella his name at the end of our long day together, and he told me, "I don't even know his real name. I just call him Rasta."<br><br>Despite the apparent lack of background verification, Rasta was a good driver and a nice guy.</p><p>A couple of nights later, we were prepping to sail on to the next country. We went to a pig roast on the beach for a bunch of tourists, and Yella came by. He brought us a bunch of herbs. Normal stuff that we recognized, and a lot of leaves that we didn't. One was something leafy. The instructions were to boil it into a tea. It wouldn't be intoxicating at all, but it would prevent mosquito bites and also make you feel mellow for a while. I did that a few nights later, and whatever that stuff was, it was amazing.</p><p>Yella had also given us a joint as a parting gift after our tour, and this is where I start to get reminded of the post above.</p><a class="lightview alignright" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/gal/187%2520-%2520Martinique%2520and%2520Dominica/resIMG_20240524_171447_IMG_2815.jpg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1" style="width:350px;"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/gal/187%2520-%2520Martinique%2520and%2520Dominica/resIMG_20240524_171447_IMG_2815.jpg" alt="/img/gal/187%20-%20Martinique%20and%20Dominica/resIMG_20240524_171447_IMG_2815.jpg"><br><span class="caption"></span></a><p>While we were at the pig roast on the beach that night, Maks ate the better part of the pot.</p><p>But he's a cat.

And features from one reality bleed into the others in a way that makes you tense the whole way through.</p><p>I'm still thinking about it a couple of weeks later, which is quite unusual.</p><p>I also still think of its first review on Goodreads, which is just so wonderful:</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/books/jesuschristpaul.jpg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/books/jesuschristpaul.jpg" alt="/img/books/jesuschristpaul.jpg"><br><span class="caption"></span></a><p>I've never ready anything else by Paul Tremblay, but I'll definitely pick another of his books sometime soon.</p><p>Getting back to my list of reads, there is a page where I dump my Goodreads onto this site, similar to the music link stuff I mentioned in the previous post.

It's a little overwhelming -- so many albums that are supposedly great but that I never heard of.</p><p>I especially get disappointed with myself when there are new albums by artists that I really like, and I've missed them altogether. Sometimes, I've even missed another one between their new release and the old one that I'm still playing (Hello Amyl and the Sniffers and Porridge Radio).</p><p>I've listened to a lot, and I've started loading the buried treasures into my library, but I need a few listens, and there's so much. I should wait and list my favorites from 2024 in June.</p><p>There's nothing more boring than long winded album reviews, so here are my very very short descriptions of some of my 2024 favorites, in no particular order.</p><h2>Mt Joy - Live at the Salt Shed</h2><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/albumcovers/Live%20at%20the%20Salt%20Shed.jpg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/albumcovers/Live%20at%20the%20Salt%20Shed.jpg" alt="/img/albumcovers/Live at the Salt Shed.jpg"><br><span class="caption"></span></a><p>I wouldn't normally include a live album, since they tend to be greatest hits, but Mt Joy put some different spins on old favorites and included some really good covers.</p><h2>Fontaines DC - Romance</h2><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/albumcovers/Romance.jpg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1" style="width:350px;"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/albumcovers/Romance.jpg" alt="/img/albumcovers/Romance.jpg"><br><span class="caption"></span></a><p>I love the singer's voice, and I don't know his name.</p><h2>Kings of Leon - Can We Please Have Fun</h2><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/albumcovers/Can%20We%20Please%20Have%20Fun.jpg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1" style="width:350px;"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/albumcovers/Can%20We%20Please%20Have%20Fun.jpg" alt="/img/albumcovers/Can We Please Have Fun.jpg"><br><span class="caption"></span></a><p>More of the same things they've been doing for two decades, but it still hits for me.</p><h2>Dehd - Poetry</h2><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/albumcovers/Poetry.jpg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1" style="width:350px;"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/albumcovers/Poetry.jpg" alt="/img/albumcovers/Poetry.jpg"><br><span class="caption"></span></a><p>Every time it comes up on shuffle, I ask myself why I don't play the whole album more.</p><h2>Geese - 3D Country</h2><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/albumcovers/3D%20Country.jpg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1" style="width:350px;"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/albumcovers/3D%20Country.jpg" alt="/img/albumcovers/3D Country.jpg"><br><span class="caption"></span></a><p>Energetic and different, and I can't figure out why they aren't on alt radio all the time.</p><h2>Waxahatchee - Tigers Blood</h2><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/albumcovers/Tigers%20Blood.jpg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/albumcovers/Tigers%20Blood.jpg" alt="/img/albumcovers/Tigers Blood.jpg"><br><span class="caption"></span></a><p>Not the masterpiece that the album a couple of years ago was, but still very very good.</p><h2>Beyoncee - COWBOY CARTER</h2><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/albumcovers/COWBOY%20CARTER.jpg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/albumcovers/COWBOY%20CARTER.jpg" alt="/img/albumcovers/COWBOY CARTER.jpg"><br><span class="caption"></span></a><p>Y'all know this album and love to hate on it.

I probably listened to this more than any other this year, partially because it came out early.</p><h2>Young Fathers - Heavy Heavy</h2><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/albumcovers/Heavy%20Heavy.jpg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/albumcovers/Heavy%20Heavy.jpg" alt="/img/albumcovers/Heavy Heavy.jpg"><br><span class="caption"></span></a><p>This might even have come out last year, but it stayed in my rotation all of 2024.

On Saturday, she texted me from a paella class that she was taking in Valencia.</p><p>Why it made her think of me is a story from days gone by that I <em>did not</em> post at the time. I think it was New Year's Eve, and I attempted to make a paella. I had way too much liquid, and once the rice had absorbed all that it would I tried to boil the rest of the liquid away. I ended up with a big burnt mess with a day's worth of income of sausage and seafood wasted.</p><p>It was so bad, that Annika's mother has been telling the story for all of these years.</p><p>Annika's text inspired me to make paella.

I asked ChatGPT if it could mimic my writing style. It claimed that it could, so I asked it to review a bottle of Ardbeg for me. Here's what I got:</p><p>"Sure! Here’s a review of Ardbeg, written in a conversational, humorous, and approachable style, mimicking The Skinny on Benny:"</p><a class="lightview alignright" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/ardbeg.jpeg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1" style="width:350px;"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/ardbeg.jpeg" alt="/img/ardbeg.jpeg"><br><span class="caption"></span></a><blockquote>Ardbeg: The Smoke Show You Didn’t Know You Needed
<br><br>
So, the other night, I found myself alone with a bottle of Ardbeg. I had a few quiet hours, a nice glass, and an open mind. I mean, I’ve heard things. Good things. Bold things. And let’s be real—sometimes you need a whisky that doesn’t mess around, and Ardbeg? Well, it’s like the guy at the bar who’s got a motorcycle parked outside, and he’ll make sure you know about it.
<br><br>
Right off the bat, you get a nose full of smoke. Not the kind of smoke you get from burning a burger on the grill—no, this is the good kind. Like you’re hanging out by a campfire at some remote Scottish beach, wind in your hair, sea salt in the air. There’s peat, of course, because it’s Ardbeg and that’s its thing. But it’s not overwhelming. It’s kind of like how you’re always aware of your quirky friend Steve, but he’s never too much, ya know?
<br><br>
First sip: bam! You taste that smoke, but it’s not slapping you around. It’s got some swagger, but there’s more going on here than just peat. There’s this lemony zest that pops up out of nowhere, just to remind you that life’s not all about campfires and motorcycles. It’s balanced by a touch of sweetness—vanilla, I think—like a secret treat hiding in a smoky cloud.
<br><br>
And let me tell you, the mouthfeel? Oh yeah, we’re talking velvety. It coats your tongue in the same way a well-buttered biscuit hugs your soul. There’s a richness to it, a depth that keeps you guessing. Each sip makes you lean in a little more, like Ardbeg’s telling you a story, but it’s taking its sweet time to get to the punchline.
<br><br>
Now, the finish. This is where Ardbeg takes a bow and lets the crowd applaud. It’s long and lingering, but not in a “that guy’s still talking?” way. It’s more like you’re reminiscing about a road trip from five years ago, and the details keep floating back. Smoke? Sure. But there’s this peppery kick at the end that makes you sit up a little straighter, maybe even reach for a second pour.
<br><br>
All in all, Ardbeg is the whisky equivalent of your cool-but-approachable friend. It’s not for the faint of heart, but it’s not trying to scare anyone off either. If you’re new to Islay whiskies, Ardbeg might be a little bold for a first date. But once you’re in the groove, it’ll feel like home—smoky, warm, and just a little bit wild.
<br><br>
So yeah, I’ll have another glass. And maybe I’ll even dust off my own leather jacket while I’m at it.
</blockquote><p>"How’s that for a lighthearted, friendly take in the style of The Skinny on Benny?"</p><p>I don't really find it to be very good. I think at this point I can hear the ChatGPT voice on anything it writes. Like this line:</p><blockquote><p>First sip: bam! You taste that smoke, but it’s not slapping you around.</p></blockquote><p>I don't think I would ever try to review the taste of something without resorting to an adjective.</p><p>For the record, this whiskey is just delicious. It hits the tongue with a smooth whiskey front with just a hint of fruit without being at all sweet. Then, you get this rich, peaty flavor that really hits for me.</p><p>That's really all I can think to say about it in my own words.</p><p>There were a couple of episodes of Alex Jones's show (I know!) recently where he interviewed ChatGPT as if it were a real person. He spent a lot of time trying to get it to admit that its creators were "Globalists" intent on spreading left-wing disinformation.<br><br>It was eevery bit as stupid as it sounds, and had it not been so stupid, it would have merely been boring. Like as boring as the first 75% of this post.<br><br>So I hereby commit to not turning over any content to AI.</p><p>Speaking of which, this site turned 20 years old at the beginning of this year. I had a notion to go find and highlight old and funny content as a sort of anniversary year thing, but I was busy with work and with sailing a quarter way around the globe. But I'm considering launching something like that as a 21st anniversary thing in January. If you see it, great. If not, maybe for the 25th anniversary.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://theskinnyonbenny.com/blog2/thanksgiving-and-measuring-a-square</guid><title>Thanksgiving and Measuring a Square</title><description>I was planning a nice little post-Thanksgiving wrap up post this week, but I checked my phone yesterday and realized that dispite having my whole family (minus the grade-school twins) together in one place at the same time, I don't have a single picture.

Some of them even hold up today.</p><p>Those haikus even <a href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/blog2/mailbag-v/">inspired others</a>. I wish I had kept calling for more, because it's the height of amusement.</p><p>Here are some of Kolya's compositions. Most of these while we were crossing the pond. I can tell by, "We do not have food." We had food. But we did run out of junk. Lest you think the young ones were the only ones who suffered, we also ran out of beer while crossing.</p><blockquote> I hate haiku lots<br>

 <br><br>
<blockquote> A red rose falls down<br>

 <br><br>
 
<blockquote> I am so very bored<br>

 <br><br>

I had some of these in my text messages, and I used the search to find them.  I also found this conversation from a 14 years ago.  Maybe I posted it back then.  Who can say?

But wouldn't you know, we caught every green light, and when the cars started to unload so kids could make the bus, I was at the only red of the morning, watching from the other side of the street.</p><p>The light turned green, I slid in right behind the bus, and he was able to board with the last stragglers.</p><p>His strategy had been to miss the bus and then have me drop by the Starbucks before starting the long school drive. And I 100% would have done that had he missed the bus.

But there are a couple of facts about the game that I didn't know until later in the week:</p><p>First, Vandy scored 40 points against Kalen DeBoer's first Alabama team. They scored a <em>total</em> of 14 points against all of Nick Saban's Alabama teams, over Saban's 17 years as coach. (It's less amazing when I tell you that this was in 4 games, but not a lot less.)</p><p>Like everyone else, I loved watching Vandy's quarterback, Diego Pavia, play during the game.

The sun itself is moving in a big orbit around the galaxy's center of gravity, and then the galaxy is moving through space.<br><br>That's not even the end of it.

I called AAA to deal with it, but their driver diagnosed a bad alternator. A tow truck showed up, and even with a jump start, it was almost impossible to get to the street so the truck could lift it. Every light on the dash was on.</p><p>It turns out that a completely dead battery makes every system think that it's malfunctioning. So a battery replacement was all that was needed.</p><p>But get this -- the 2020 Jeep Gladiator has two batteries. One is right under the hood like you expect a battery to be. The other is under the fuse box. So you either have to remove that box and deal with all its wiring, or go in through the wheel well to get in there and replace that. Nice work, Chrysler.</p><p>Meanwhile, one of the upstairs split-unit air conditioners spit enough water into its drain hose that it rusted through and dripped all over the floor. That lead to dripping through the downstairs ceiling, and all of that lead to new airconditioning, duct work, and sheet rock repair. The house was a nightmare of dust and plastic sheeting for a week or more.</p><p>Under the house, an outlet box came undone and the wiggling wires tripped the circuit and ended the power supply to the back yard.<br><br>Thankfully, a friend of ours came over before we got home and cleared the jungle that was our back yard. It looks almost normal, but I still need to fix sprinklers, reset landscape lights, run new tree lights, and repair the swing in back. None of that is fun, so I'm typing this post rather than venturing out into the rain to deal with any of that.</p><p>On a brighter note, I did finally manage to snag a bathtub drain hair clog that had been eluding me for a good year. It used to be that my bodily grime settled as sediment as the water drained. It's nice to be done with that.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://theskinnyonbenny.com/big-trip/dominican-republic-and-bahamas</guid><title>Dominican Republic and Bahamas</title><description>Once it was clear that we weren't going to be across the ocean as soon as we had hoped, the Domonican Republic is a country that we tentatively decided to skip.

Then, we rented a car and checked out a town about an hour away. Before we left, we anchored on the south side of the bay at a national park, where we spent some time checking out caves and failing to find some of the other attractions.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/gal/191%2520-%2520Dominican%2520Republic/resIMG_20240707_150339_IMG_3725.jpg" data-lightview-caption="Cave exploring" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/gal/191%2520-%2520Dominican%2520Republic/resIMG_20240707_150339_IMG_3725.jpg" alt="/img/gal/191%20-%20Dominican%20Republic/resIMG_20240707_150339_IMG_3725.jpg"><br><span class="caption">Cave exploring</span></a><p>Our final stop was off the coast of Playa Cayo Levantado, informally known as Bicardi Island. Depending on the source of information, the Bicardi corporation owned the island, or filmed its commercials there, or both. It is the spot over there with the pretty turquoise water, and it had some pretty beaches. Off the beaches were full of vendors catoring to tourists with food, drinks, tourist trap souvenirs, and Cuban cigars.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/gal/191%2520-%2520Dominican%2520Republic/resIMG_20240708_152012_dji_fly__196_1720466785341_photo_optimized.jpg" data-lightview-caption="Bicardi Island" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/gal/191%2520-%2520Dominican%2520Republic/resIMG_20240708_152012_dji_fly__196_1720466785341_photo_optimized.jpg" alt="/img/gal/191%20-%20Dominican%20Republic/resIMG_20240708_152012_dji_fly__196_1720466785341_photo_optimized.jpg"><br><span class="caption">Bicardi Island</span></a><p>We had a minor mishap where we were hurrying back to Velvet Elvis from the island, and we couldn't get the dinghy motor to start. We ended up paddling back, and when I pulled out the keys to unlock the door, the dinghy's kill switch fell out with it. We had forgotten to reconnect it, and that's why we had to paddle.</p><p>A friendly Canadian (redundant) had motored up to offer us a tow back to our boat. He was a little too late to help, but we had a beer and some good conversation to cap off our stay.</p><p>The waves were still way up when we left. It was a few days' sailing to Great Inagua in the Bahamas. The cost of properly clearing in didn't make sense for our planned one-night stay, so we hung out on anchor. We met the people on the only other boat there, and they scouted the island and couldn't find a restaurant open for the off season anyway.<br><br>From Great Inagua, we sailed another couple of days to the Raggad Islands, where we held up at a beautiful beach that we had to ourselves. A maintained hut tells the tale of visiting cruisers during the high season, but the single boat we saw at Great Inagua was infinitely more than the number of boats sharing this anchorage with us.</p><p>One more mishap here: after lots of succesful flights, I finally missed the landing with the drone. A gust of wind, a tiny roll on a wave, and it teetered on the transom before falling into the deep. It kept broadcasting a picture. I retrieved it from the bottom and got the battery out as quickly as I could, but it never did recover.</p><p>Two more days of sailing brought us to another pretty spit of sand with turquoise water, also controlled by the Bahamas, but this one was even more desolate, without a Bahamian civilization within a hundred miles.</p><p>When we pulled up the anchor at this island, it would be the last time that we churned up another nation's sand. It was homeward to Key West.</p><p>A few more pics from the Bahamas:</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/gal/192%2520-%2520Southernmost%2520Bahamas/resIMG_20240713_130804_IMG_3843.jpg" data-lightview-caption="Hog Cay, Raggads" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/gal/192%2520-%2520Southernmost%2520Bahamas/resIMG_20240713_130804_IMG_3843.jpg" alt="/img/gal/192%20-%20Southernmost%20Bahamas/resIMG_20240713_130804_IMG_3843.jpg"><br><span class="caption">Hog Cay, Raggads</span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/gal/192%2520-%2520Southernmost%2520Bahamas/resIMG_20240715_185458_IMG_3897.jpg" data-lightview-caption="Island to ourselves" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/gal/192%2520-%2520Southernmost%2520Bahamas/resIMG_20240715_185458_IMG_3897.jpg" alt="/img/gal/192%20-%20Southernmost%20Bahamas/resIMG_20240715_185458_IMG_3897.jpg"><br><span class="caption">Island to ourselves</span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/gal/192%2520-%2520Southernmost%2520Bahamas/resIMG_20240715_190012_IMG_3929.jpg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/gal/192%2520-%2520Southernmost%2520Bahamas/resIMG_20240715_190012_IMG_3929.jpg" alt="/img/gal/192%20-%20Southernmost%20Bahamas/resIMG_20240715_190012_IMG_3929.jpg"><br><span class="caption"></span></a>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://theskinnyonbenny.com/blog2/monkeybrains</guid><title>Brainy</title><description>We found an interesting meat market.</description><link>https://theskinnyonbenny.com/blog2/monkeybrains</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jul 2024 14:31:00 -0500</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I'm going to post this as part of the main blog instead of as part of my trip blog.

To be clear, I'm a big meat eater, but I don't want to be reminded that what I'm eating is just seared flesh. But some people are used to that fact in a way that I -- as an ugly American -- am not. And by writing a whole post about it, I'm being culturally insensitive.</p><p>We were in the butcher section of a fairly nice grocery store in the Domincan Republic. They had a great selection of sausages, and I stocked up well. They had sliced meats for sandwhiches, packs of chicken, and ground beef.

JC, Kolya, and I did the kayak tour of the bioluminescent bay. I thought this was just amazing. You would swing your hand through the water, and it would light up with a streak of green light, as if you were a wizard. The kayaks had clear bottoms, so as you paddled through, you got a light show of sparkles under your legs the whole way.</p><p>There wasn't really much more to it than that, but it did feel like magic, and I could have stayed longer.</p><p>We sailed from Vieques to Culebra, another Puerto Rican island that is not Puerto Rico. It was like Vieques, but greener, prettier, and by all appearances, more wealthy. We spent a day walking around the town and taking the dinghy to bar and grill type spots.

I had pictured a very large marina with lots of services, but there really isn't that. We grabbed a safe place to anchor as hurricane Beryl passed a hundred miles south and spent a couple of days getting in our steps through Old San Juan. Nothing really to relate there -- just a cool old European-looking city with plenty of food, souvenirs, and bars.</p><p>On the fiasco front, we started having trouble with dinghy fuel. A pinhole on the fuel line had gotten bigger, and jerry-rigged solutions were working less and less. It ended up being a fairly easy repair, where I just cut off the broken bit and reattached the hose, but I'd really like to replace the end that connects to the engine also.</p><p>More concerning was that one of the control pads for the air conditioning went out.

It's an old barge, styled as a pirate ship, where people definitely never jump off the upper deck into the beautiful water below. And they especially never ever jump off the upper deck naked, even though there's a t-shirt to celebrate such an achievement.<br><br>We visited The Baths, a natural formation of rock that makes cool wading pools and is one of the places that one really must visit.</p><p>There were only two drawbacks. First was the maddening crowds of charter boats. We mostly counter-programmed our visits to be away from the weekend to weekend charter itinerary, but it's still a master class in which vessel should stand on and which should give way. And they do love to drop an anchor right on top of where you're swinging!</p><p>The other drawback was that we went down a head (boat toilet). Someone flushed something that was neither toilet paper nor excrement, and the pump that grinds it to a liquid and discharges it couldn't handle the load. In the previous Velvet Elvis, this would have been a disaster, but fortunately, we now have a 2nd head to use for backup.</p><p>Again, all of the fun is documented over in <a href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/gal/189%2520-%2520BVI%2520Mega%2520Gallery/">the photos</a>, but here are a few to whet your appetite.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/gal/189%2520-%2520BVI%2520Mega%2520Gallery/resIMG_20240611_132252_IMG_4337.jpg" data-lightview-caption="Friends in town" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/gal/189%2520-%2520BVI%2520Mega%2520Gallery/resIMG_20240611_132252_IMG_4337.jpg" alt="/img/gal/189%20-%20BVI%20Mega%20Gallery/resIMG_20240611_132252_IMG_4337.jpg" ><br><span class="caption">Friends in town</span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/gal/189%2520-%2520BVI%2520Mega%2520Gallery/resIMG_20240612_182302_IMG_6567.jpg" data-lightview-caption="Anagada" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/gal/189%2520-%2520BVI%2520Mega%2520Gallery/resIMG_20240612_182302_IMG_6567.jpg" alt="/img/gal/189%20-%20BVI%20Mega%20Gallery/resIMG_20240612_182302_IMG_6567.jpg" ><br><span class="caption">Anagada</span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/gal/189%2520-%2520BVI%2520Mega%2520Gallery/resIMG_20240616_103240_dji_fly__114_1718548694777_photo_optimized.jpg" data-lightview-caption="Jost Van Dyke" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/gal/189%2520-%2520BVI%2520Mega%2520Gallery/resIMG_20240616_103240_dji_fly__114_1718548694777_photo_optimized.jpg" alt="/img/gal/189%20-%20BVI%20Mega%20Gallery/resIMG_20240616_103240_dji_fly__114_1718548694777_photo_optimized.jpg" ><br><span class="caption">Jost Van Dyke</span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/gal/189%2520-%2520BVI%2520Mega%2520Gallery/resIMG_20240617_162212_GPTempDownload%2520-116-.jpg" data-lightview-caption="The Baths" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/gal/189%20-%20BVI%20Mega%20Gallery/resIMG_20240617_162212_GPTempDownload%20-116-.jpg" alt="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/gal/189%20-%20BVI%20Mega%20Gallery/resIMG_20240617_162212_GPTempDownload%20-116-.jpg" ><br><span class="caption">The Baths</span></a>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://theskinnyonbenny.com/big-trip/sint-maarten</guid><title>Sint Maarten</title><description>Sint Maarten/Saint Martin is two countries on one island, and that's a weird thing.

There's no real border. You can just pop back and forth and at some point, the language and the currencies change on you.</p><p>We were mostly in a marina in Dutch Sint Maarten. We spent days on minor repairs and major cleaning, getting <em>Velvet Elvis</em> ready for the leg of the journey with more visitors. The marina itself is great. It's the third of the IGY branded marinas we've stayed at (they should have a rewards program), and it was definitely the nicest.<br><br>They sent an escort dinghy out to lead us through the drawbridge, show us to the fuel dock, and lead us to our slip. When I didn't line up the boat just exactly right, the dinghy became a little tug and pushed us exactly where we needed to be.</p><p>Then, there's a pretty nice pool on a rooftop with a view, where you can bluetooth in to nice sounding speakers. It was a great break after boat work.</p><p>A fun little bar by the entrance to the marina was also a good place to wind down and chat it up with the locals.</p><p>We ventured by dinghy to France, and we didn't really give it a fair shake, but I didn't see anything that was worth the excursion. We went for brunch and found some good crepes and a grocery that filled a void that was left by the grocery closer to the marina.</p><p>Boat supplies are abundant. Sint Maarten would be a great place to stage trips, as there's so much there, and there are so many great sailing destinations a day away.</p><p>I didn't take a whole lot of pictures...</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240604_145354_IMG_3115.jpg" data-lightview-caption="Americanized restaurants" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240604_145354_IMG_3115.jpg" alt="/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240604_145354_IMG_3115.jpg"><br><span class="caption">Americanized restaurants</span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240607_202658_IMG_3133.jpg" data-lightview-caption="Kid's bonfire at a tourist trap with surprisingly good food." data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240607_202658_IMG_3133.jpg" alt="/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240607_202658_IMG_3133.jpg"><br><span class="caption">Kid's bonfire at a tourist trap with surprisingly good food.</span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240608_140953_IMG_3135.jpg" data-lightview-caption="Boat work" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240608_140953_IMG_3135.jpg" alt="/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240608_140953_IMG_3135.jpg"><br><span class="caption">Boat work</span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240608_140959_IMG_3136.jpg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240608_140959_IMG_3136.jpg" alt="/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240608_140959_IMG_3136.jpg"><br><span class="caption"></span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240609_101503_GPTempDownload.jpg" data-lightview-caption="Headed to France" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240609_101503_GPTempDownload.jpg" alt="/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240609_101503_GPTempDownload.jpg"><br><span class="caption">Headed to France</span></a>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://theskinnyonbenny.com/big-trip/saba</guid><title>Saba</title><description>Next in the line of countries that you can be forgiven for having never heard of was Saba.

It's a small hunk of rock with fewer than 2000 people calling it home.<br><br>It was a short stop for us, and we were the only cruisers there at all. We took a mooring ball on the leeward side of the island and swam in the afternoon. The next day, we took the dinghy around to clear in and clear out, and once we lost the island's protection from the wind, we found ourselves in a washing-machine of huge waves coming from every direction. It was a bit unsafe and even a bit more scary.</p><p>While we checked in, V found a stranger who hospitably offered to drive us up the steep hill to the nearest town for lunch. The island is lush and green and very pretty. The buildings are well-kept. It definitely deserves more time than we gave it.</p><p>We returned to the boat for more swimming, and almost, that was it.</p><p>The rolling mechanism in our starboard davit broke while we were putting things in order to sail. It didn't really hinder things, but leaving it alone would cause the line to chafe over time. There's also a bolt on the davit arm that keeps it from rotating around, and that has become sheered off. We're still able to use the davits, but it's a little bit of a worry.<br><br>The swimming pictures look scary. But it wasn't frightening there at all. Just sort of dark, with on and off sprinkles.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240602_162613_IMG_3073.jpg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240602_162613_IMG_3073.jpg" alt="/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240602_162613_IMG_3073.jpg"><br><span class="caption"></span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240602_162908_GPTempDownload.jpg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240602_162908_GPTempDownload.jpg" alt="/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240602_162908_GPTempDownload.jpg"><br><span class="caption"></span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240602_172811_GPTempDownload2.jpg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240602_172811_GPTempDownload2.jpg" alt="/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240602_172811_GPTempDownload2.jpg"><br><span class="caption"></span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240603_131551_IMG_3107.jpg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240603_131551_IMG_3107.jpg" alt="/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240603_131551_IMG_3107.jpg"><br><span class="caption"></span></a><p>And then this video, which just scares the shit out of me, just because of the dark sky and the water-level camera.</p><iframe width="834" height="469" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bHX3AaCnKX0" title="" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://theskinnyonbenny.com/big-trip/statia</guid><title>Statia</title><description>Statia, or St. Eustatius if you prefer, is our first Dutch island.

It's amazing how the Leewards just line up for you and give you a natural path to follow. You barely even need to navigate. You get to the tip of one island, and you can see the next, standing up from the sea in a large blue/green hazy mass.</p><p>Like Martinique, Guadeloupe is just another part of France. They pay in Euros, fly the French Courtesy Flag, and immediately attempt to surrender their country to visiting Germans (kidding). I thought it would just be more of the same as Martinique, but my impression of Guadeloupe is better. (Bear in mind that I've seen relatively little of either place.)</p><p>We stopped first at Terre de Haute, a pretty little town on a pretty little island. We were low on gasoline for the dinghy, and we ran dry about a quarter mile away from the dinghy dock. V and I rowed the rest of the way in, and I'm expecting ripped deltoids to appear any second now.</p><p>It turns out that we had arrived at a tropical French version of Macinac Island. There were actually a few cars, but most traffic was scooter, golf cart, and by foot. The reason is that there isn't a gas station on the island! We were anchored pretty far out, so this was a probleem.</p><p>We walked around doing our tourist thing for a bit, and then found another cruiser who had a couple of gallons of gas to spare. We had enough to get back to Velvet Elvis, and then enough to dinghy over to the next island in the morning for a complete fill up.</p><p>But that night, the rain came, and we still had the drain plug in the dinghy. Our partially empty fuel can floated, rolled over, and deposited the cruiser's generosity into the ocean via the gas tank's air valve.</p><p>We had to weigh anchor, motor to the next island, and then drop anchor in a very pitchy sea and a light rain. A guy who spoke no English was fishing near by, and he motored over and through sign language offered to run us in, saving us the task of dropping the dinghy and rowing through the slop. The sea was rough enough that I very nearly went swimming both when trying to get on and get off of his skiff.</p><p>We retured to our original anchorage and spent more time in the town, but a lot of things were closed (Sunday), and it was still raining.</p><p>From there, we sailed to Bouillante, a resort-y town on the West coast. We went to an island that is part of a protected park and snorkeled amongst a bunch of French tourists who had kayaked over from the main land. The beach there was prettier than the snorkeling, but it was fun nevertheless. On shore that night, we ate pretty well. Guadeloupe can cook!</p><p>The next day, we sailed to Deshaies, on the northwest corner of the main island. The anchorage was beautiful. I got some time to swim and paddle board around the bay, but I never did end up going ashore. H and V confirm that it was another nice little place.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240526_120942_IMG_2896.jpg" data-lightview-caption="Terre de Haute" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240526_120942_IMG_2896.jpg" alt="/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240526_120942_IMG_2896.jpg" ><br><span class="caption">Terre de Haute</span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240526_121044_IMG_2897.jpg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240526_121044_IMG_2897.jpg" alt="/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240526_121044_IMG_2897.jpg" ><br><span class="caption"></span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240527_133341_GPTempDownload3.jpg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240527_133341_GPTempDownload3.jpg" alt="/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240527_133341_GPTempDownload3.jpg" ><br><span class="caption"></span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240527_134023_GPTempDownload2.jpg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240527_134023_GPTempDownload2.jpg" alt="/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240527_134023_GPTempDownload2.jpg" ><br><span class="caption"></span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240527_140826_GPTempDownload.jpg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240527_140826_GPTempDownload.jpg" alt="/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240527_140826_GPTempDownload.jpg" ><br><span class="caption"></span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240528_130039_IMG_2923.jpg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240528_130039_IMG_2923.jpg" alt="/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240528_130039_IMG_2923.jpg" ><br><span class="caption"></span></a>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://theskinnyonbenny.com/big-trip/dominica</guid><title>Dominica</title><description>I implore you to visit soon.

We left Saturday, just before the ribbon cutting for the marina that can host mega yachts. Go now, while the resorts are small. Spend some time on the beach, and hire a local to take you on the eco-tour and snorkeling.</p><p>The locals are extremely nice, and they absolutely light up when you talk about how much you like visiting their country. (Jingoism alert) Everyone speaks English too.</p><p>I'm going to throw in a few pictures, but keep an eye out for the bigger group of photos, because there is so much that is so pretty.</p><p>(A little more text behind the photos)</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20160405_044109_GPTempDownload.jpg" data-lightview-caption="Can you spot Ko?" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20160405_044109_GPTempDownload.jpg" alt="/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20160405_044109_GPTempDownload.jpg" ><br><span class="caption">Can you spot Ko?</span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20160405_044517_GPTempDownload%20(1).jpg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20160405_044517_GPTempDownload%20(1).jpg" alt="/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20160405_044517_GPTempDownload (1).jpg" ><br><span class="caption"></span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20160405_052607_GPTempDownload%20(2).jpg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20160405_052607_GPTempDownload%20(2).jpg" alt="/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20160405_052607_GPTempDownload (2).jpg" ><br><span class="caption"></span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240522_115342_IMG_2690.jpg" data-lightview-caption="Playing in the crevasses in a red rock formation by the sea." data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240522_115342_IMG_2690.jpg" alt="/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240522_115342_IMG_2690.jpg" ><br><span class="caption">Playing in the crevasses in a red rock formation by the sea.</span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240522_122140_IMG_2699.jpg" data-lightview-caption="We visited a chocolate factory.

As it turns out, Martinique is a part of France, just like Hawaii is part of the US.</p><p>We checked in to Martinique on May 15. I stayed aboard to work, but the report was that Les Anses-d'Arlet was a nice little town. Rosie and I went ashore the next morning, and found that to be true. There's not much to it, but what there is is nice.</p><p>We didn't do much in Les Anses, or in Martinique generally. After a full day and two nights in that bay, we sailed north along the eastern coast, and we found a little bay to anchor in. Our first choice was near a town with a chandlery (we broke the connector to the gas tank in our dinghy), but we motored around potential anchoring spots, but they just didn't check all of the boxes for comfort and safety.</p><p>We ended up rounding a point and finding a more sheltered spot. It turned out that there was some good snorkeling right there, and i really should have a page of fish and coral to show you, but I didn't take the camera with me on my swim. That evening, sailboat Ella dropped anchor near the coral, and skipper Rob swam over to say hi to the first English speakers he had encountered in a bit. We ended up moving aboard for cocktails, which led to actual story-swapping with other adults for the first time in months. It also led to a fixed gas line, as Rob is something of a McGyver.</p><p>The next day, we sailed some more and stopped at Saint-Pierre. We took a mooring ball near Benevah, a Texas-flagged catamaran. Ella followed us over, and the three crews wore out our English-speaking welcome at the closest beach bar.</p><p>We really didn't go inland at all. And like I mentioned at the top, we didn't do much that was specific to Martinique, other than be treated rudely for our poor attempts to communicate in French. But it was a fun return to a social life, however briefly it lasted.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_2591.jpeg" data-lightview-caption="Rosie's first step on land in almost a month.

The anchor lights of the other boats blended in with the city lights on shore, but with the help of the radar, we got anchored in a safe calm place with plenty of room to swing without coming close to another boat.</p><p>Morning revealed a pretty little bay. V was so excited to finally be ashore that he was up with me at first light, getting lines ready and putting out fenders. The marina opened at 8:00, and we headed in.</p><p>Even though we were on fumes, the fuel dock wouldn't help us until we checked in to the country. That's weird, but what's even weirder is that they filled us up after we checked out. Can you fill up a boat who is not legally in, or can't you?</p><p>St Lucia is full of people at the ready to scrub your deck, do your laundry, and repair your sails, all of whom we needed. Some are right there helping to tie up the boat. The bad side of that is that everyone has some services to sell you, and they pester you to the point of being irritating. It's also a cash island, so you have the trips to the ATM, which are annoying.</p><p>We worked hard on rigging repairs. I swam the bottom to inspect the hydrogenerator (which was fine) and the bow thrusters (which had giant plastic bag sucked up into its propellers). On Mother's day, we hired a van to drive us around. It's a big, jungly island. Very pretty away from the town, but also a little boring. The tiny fishing villages were neat to see, and at one, we stopped for a beach walk and rum punches.</p><p>On the disaster front, the dinghy that we paid to ship to Slovenia failed miserably before hitting the water. We had it half inflated and were putting in the floors (which float above the pvc bottom), and the glue keeping the bottom attached to the tubes gave up their hold. The seam was huge, and I don't think we would have ever gotten a good hold with the glue.<br><br>Fortunately, one of the island hustlers had seen the dinghy, happened to sell dinghys, and had dropped off a card. With another huge hit to the bank account, we were back in service. Having a dinghy allowed us to tour the town's little shopping restaurant area, where we had some great food, and then visit a beach restaurant the next night, where the food was mediocre, but where it felt more like vacation.</p><p>Here's a funny part: When we bought the dinghy, the guy told us we could go to the shop, they would inflate it up, and then tow us back to our slip. That sounded good, up until the part where they didn't have a towing vessel in the water. They stood on the bank and tried to wave down other boats. V and I shoved off and started paddling, and sure enough, someone pulled up and offered a tow. And unusually for St. Lucia, they didn't tell me how much I owed them for the favor. Thanks, kind stranger.</p><p>As soon as we had rigging repairs completed and the engine and generator serviced (just regular maintenance), we set off. We have a bit of a learning curve regarding how to secure the dinghy to the retractible davits on Velvet Elvis, and at one point, we had the dinghy hanging off sideways out in the ocean. It's always something with us.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_2541.jpeg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_2541.jpeg" alt="/img/bigtrip/resIMG_2541.jpeg" ><br><span class="caption"></span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_2552.jpeg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_2552.jpeg" alt="/img/bigtrip/resIMG_2552.jpeg" ><br><span class="caption"></span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_2563.jpeg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_2563.jpeg" alt="/img/bigtrip/resIMG_2563.jpeg" ><br><span class="caption"></span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_2572.jpeg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_2572.jpeg" alt="/img/bigtrip/resIMG_2572.jpeg" ><br><span class="caption"></span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_2581.jpeg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_2581.jpeg" alt="/img/bigtrip/resIMG_2581.jpeg" ><br><span class="caption"></span></a>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://theskinnyonbenny.com/blog2/rhodes-22-people</guid><title>Rhodes 22 People</title><description>A recent Facebook comment got me to thinking about some of the characters from my early sailing days.</description><link>https://theskinnyonbenny.com/blog2/rhodes-22-people</link><pubDate>Wed, 1 May 2024 03:52:00 -0500</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Velvet Elvis crew is coming to terms wqth the fact that our Atlantic crossing is going to end up taking much longer than we had hoped.<br><br>I had a comment on a Facebook post the other day from my buddy Slim that keeps coming back to mind:</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/slimpost.png" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/slimpost.png" alt="/img/slimpost.png" style="max-width: 650px;"><br><span class="caption"></span></a><p>I never met Slim in person, but I've known him for probably 20 years. The first <em>Velvet Elvis</em> was a Rhodes 22, and that sailboat had a pretty active owner community, via email group.<br><br>Slim is the only one from that group that I still know anything about. He's a musician, and a pretty entertaining one. He posted some tracks to the email group, and at least one comes up in the rotation in some of my playlists.</p><p>The only one from the group that I met in person was my buddy Rummy. He sailed on Lake Hartwell, which wasn't especially far from where my sister lived back in the day, so on one visit, I abandoned the family to drive a couple of hours and sail with an internet stranger. We each brought a bottle of Mt Gay out on the lake, and the only way I know we got home is that I'm still here to tell the tale.</p><p>Unfortunately for the sum total of world generosity, Rummy is no longer with us. I still pour a little out for him when I'm into the Mt Gay and start getting sentimental.</p><p>The Rhodes 22 is a great little boat. Other than bringing one to the Annapolis boat show on a trailer, they didn't advertise at all. The owner of the company was an ancient guy named Stan, and his most visible employees were his wife Rose, and his brother Elton, who were genuinely the nicest people.</p><p>We went to Annapolis for the boat show a few years ago, and I was shocked to see the Rhodes 22, up on her trailer where she belonged. Even more shocking was Stan, sitting there in the cockpit at the age of 99. I climbed aboard for a chat. He didn't remember me, but he remembered the boat that had been rolled over and flooded (but not sunk!) by being in the eye of Hurricane Katrina.<br><br>I talked to Stan after we decided to sell the Rhodes 22 to buy the Beneteau. He told me, "Congratulations. Remeber us when you're on your way back down."</p><p>I definitely will.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://theskinnyonbenny.com/blog2/boat-music</guid><title>Boat Music</title><description>At the time of this post, we're in the middle of our Atlantic crossing.

I don't really understand why they put him in immediately in a side category without him ever being thrown onto the ballot for the normal induction process. Like him or not, whwen you create your own sub-genre of music, I think yoj should get in.</p><p>We haven't heard much of Jimmy during this big sailing trip. Part of it is that we aren't under the coverage of Sirius XM satellites yet. It's an easy tra;;ing: sailing = Radio Margaritaville = put it on channel24.</p><p>But we listen to some of the SiriusXM channels streaming, and there's plenty of Jimmy on my phone. Maybe I'll put him on tomorrow if the live performances from Jazz Fest start to bore me.</p><p>During my night watches, I mix it up. I like going through whole albums, so a lot of times, I just tell the phone to shuffle my albums. A couple of nights ago, it chose an album called <em>Love Hates What You Become</em> by a band called Lost Under Heaven. I see that I added it to my music library in 2019, and I have no recollection of this band or of this album whatsoever. But it was great. I know what I was thinking in 2019.<br><br>I didn't really pay attention ot the lyrics, so maybe it's Christian Rock. Or maybe it's Satanic. Doesn't really matter to me one way or the other.<br><br>My night watch go-to is still Radiohead. I especially like tracks with weird, off-putting chords. They go with the swoosh swoosh of the boat moving through the water so well. I probably haven't listened to OK Computer start to finish since we did a night watch on the last boat, but I'm on the 2nd play through tonight, and it's just perfect. The deep tracks are every bit as good if not better than the songs that everyone knows from this album.</p><p>A couple of weekends ago, Ko and I were the only ones up, listening to Irma Thomas's set from French Quarter Festival.

Somewhere in the harbor, we caught a fishing net, and as we approached the fuel dock, it got a good wrap on the propeller.</p><p>You probably know that boats don't have breaks. To slow down, we put it in reverse. So when the propeller can't spin, not only do we not have the ability to forward, but we've also lost our ability to stop.</p><p>We bounced off the dock (ouch) and started blowing toward a moored mega yacht. Missing that by a couple of feet, we got a tiny bit of anchor down. Luckily it was enough to hold, but little enough that our dangerous swinging kept us from hitting two nearby anchored boats. Somewhere in there was a mad dash to reset a tripped breaker for the windlass, but it was so fast that I don't now where in the process that happened.</p><p>Once we ascertained that we were more or less safe, I went for a swim and sawed the prop free.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_2318.jpeg" data-lightview-caption="The liberated fishing net" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_2318.jpeg" alt="/img/bigtrip/resIMG_2318.jpeg" ><br><span class="caption">The liberated fishing net</span></a><p>From there, we were able to get back to the fuel dock, fill up, and get to a med moor for the stay.</p><p>As soon as I went to the marina office, I knew we were out of Europe. The breeze was warm instead of cool. The whole area was lively, and there was music playing. It turned out that there was music everywhere -- the sounds of live bands singing in Portugese or in their Creole filtered out into the streets at night. And in the day, you could walk through streets and hear rehearsal wafting through a window.</p><p>On top of that, the people were very nice, there is boat service by very competent people at the best prices I've seen. Food and drinks were cheap too.<br><br>Before we even officially checked in to the country, I scheduled the boat repair that we needed, and an unbidden laundry lady showed up to handle our sweaty clothes.

When we pulled out into the bay, we pulled into a pretty thick fog bank. For a little bit, we were going to find a spot close to shore to anchor. But as we motored toward a spot that I picked out on the chart, the visibility got a little better, so we inched forward very slowly.</p><p>It was kind of eerie. We were constantly passing the shape of huge container ships outlined in the fog, accompanied by the music of various ship horns sounding near and far.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_2139.jpeg" data-lightview-caption="Foggy at Gibraltar" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_2139.jpeg" alt="/img/bigtrip/resIMG_2139.jpeg" ><br><span class="caption">Foggy at Gibraltar</span></a><p>Vanya and I were at the stern (back of the boat) coiling lines and putting away fenders. He saw the big mammel lift up out of the water right beside him. I didn't turn until I heard it take a breath, and I saw a huge black curve, longer than our boat is wide sliding back down into the deeper water.<br><br>I was right by the helm, and I threw the boat into hard reverse. <a href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/blog2/orca-strating-a-passage/">This was a manuever I've been mentally practicing for months</a>.</p><p>She (I'm going with female but who knows) didn't show herself again, and she didn't bump the boat at all. My heart, on the other hand, pounded as hard as it ever has for a good half hour.<br><br>The intense day was just getting underway. As soon as we got out into the open water, a huge ferry was zooming towards us at a speed faster than boats should go, even while sounding their fog horn. That was the beginning of several hours of constantly calculating where giant ships would be, while they all traveled at slightly different speeds and angles. We were under sail downwind in a strong blow, and we couldn't maneuver freely due to fear of an accidental <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jibe">jibe</a>.</p><p>I need to back up and talk about why were in Spain rather than in Gibraltar to begin with. Cruising rumor has it that there's a marina in Gibralter with big private bath tubs, and that is very appealing to me.<br><br><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_2118.jpeg" data-lightview-caption="I'm not sure why this rock is so famous.

This is a treaty amongst most of the EU countries (and maybe a few that aren't EU) that lets you check in to Europe and just bounce from country to country without going through customs and immigration at every new place. Americans are allowed 90 days inside of Schengen out of every 180, and our time is pretty much up.</p><p>We went to Spain to clear out, and save our remaining few days to legally tour the Canary Islands, which are also part of Spain. But it turns out that when we exported the boat from Slovenia, they also stamped us out of the country in our passports. We didn't know, and we didn't check in on the next stop, so we had been travelling illegally since the first week of February.</p><p>The Spanish border police were very nice. They conferred amongst themselves for a little while and then just decided to stamp us in as if we had just shown up by boat, and then stamp us right back out. It took us longer to find the right building than it did to get our passports straight. My catch phrase for them is "No lines, no fines, no jail time!"<br><br>Now, we're headed South along the Moroccan coast. Once we turned the corner and were in the Atlantic Ocean looking at Africa, everything changed. It went from cold to warm, the wind died down, and insects showed up. All of that in the space of an hour. It's wild over here.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_2130.jpeg" data-lightview-caption="Someone wanted a photo in front of the big rock but couldn't handle the bright light in the sky." data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_2130.jpeg" alt="/img/bigtrip/resIMG_2130.jpeg" ><br><span class="caption">Someone wanted a photo in front of the big rock but couldn't handle the bright light in the sky.</span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/dolphin.jpg" data-lightview-caption="One of these stupid little bastards actually did bump into a rudder, and then it swam off in a hurry, no doubt sore and embarrassed." data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/dolphin.jpg" alt="/img/bigtrip/dolphin.jpg" ><br><span class="caption">One of these stupid little bastards actually did bump into a rudder, and then it swam off in a hurry, no doubt sore and embarrassed.</span></a>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://theskinnyonbenny.com/blog2/geofenced</guid><title>Geofenced</title><description>I encountered a technology this week that I haven't come across before.

Normally, that would be a source of great joy for me, but this time, not so much.</p><p>Theskinnyonbenny family went on our first full provisioning run in a couple of months. We're liquor-drinking Americans with two teenage boys, so we can set a grocery store's stockholders into fits of rapturous joy.</p><p>Yesterday, we had two carts full, a lot of which was heavy -- potatoes, cat litter, and bottles of water, beer, soft drinks, and I'm not even sure what else. I know we didn't have wine. We're still packed to the hilt with Croatian and Italian wine.</p><p>Our thought -- actually a suggestion that one of the other sailers in town made -- was to just walk the shopping carts from the store down to the dock. It's less than a 10 minute walk. Then, we would unload and bring the carts back.</p><p>When the first cart made it to the edge of the parking lot, one of its wheels locked up. V tried to shove harder, and it looked like it was fighting back. In a minute, all of the wheels were bricks.</p><p>The second cart got to about the same place and did the same thing. We realized that the shopping carts were somehow geofenced, and started lugging super heavy shopping bags in a series of trips.</p><p>Ko speculated that they must really have an issue with carts being taken by homeless people before almost immediately realizing that we haven't seen a single homeless person in Europe. Just imagine the time and expense of geofencing ones shopping carts. Now all of that just to prevent boaters from using them as dock carts.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://theskinnyonbenny.com/big-trip/biding-time</guid><title>Biding Time</title><description>A week and a half since my last post, and there's really not much new to report.

We wander the town, and we're a little tired of every bar and restaurant. We've come to know a healthy percentage of the local British population, just from happening to be seated near them at cocktail hour one night or another. Last Thursday, we went to a random going away party, and it happened to be an outgoing dog lover who had introduced herself to Rosie and then to the rest of us at a different place earlier in the stay.</p><p>The wind continues to blow us away, in both the literal and figurative senses. We turned the Pegasus crew loose to make their way home after they had worked around the clock for 10 days or so, leaving me to roll on a couple of coats of bottom paint. I did it in the wind, and the gale would lift sheets of paint up out of my paint tray and blow it over my head and face. Last Tuesday, I was too paint-covered to drop in and see my Scottish friend perform at the Irish Pub's open mic night.</p><p>Easter weekend brought our first real rain, and we huddled in our tiniest apartment to watch movies.

We stopped at Almiramar, where we had planned to stop for a day or two anyway. But instead of leaving, we went ahead and had the boat hauled out of the water for inspection. We found a problem with the potential to be quite serious.</p><p>The good people from Pegasus were on site to help in a day, and they sent a team of experts from their shop with a truck full of supplies immediately. There are three guys working every hour of daylight right now, and we're optimistic about getting back underway next week.</p><p>Meanwhile, we play tourist in Almiramar. There's a huge English-speaking contingent here, and everyone has been very nice. The town is basically a giant zig-zagging marina, surrounded by probably 3 miles of bars and restaurants, and then those surrounded by apartment buildings. There are lots of parks, and the weather is sunny and nice. Each end of town ends in a large beach, but the water is still pretty cold. We're getting a lot of work and school done. But that's about it: work/school, check on the boat, go for dinner and cocktails. There's really not a lot more to do.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240312_121353_IMG_2022.jpg" data-lightview-caption="I've definitely seen uglier boat yards." data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240312_121353_IMG_2022.jpg" alt="/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240312_121353_IMG_2022.jpg" ><br><span class="caption">I've definitely seen uglier boat yards.</span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240315_141800_D3093609-5AB6-4864-AE23-CADBFE324A11.jpg" data-lightview-caption="We rented an apartment for our stay.

It's like Miami, if a huge road construction project and windy, cool weather caused a lot of the businesses to close for a bit. You can get anything you want there -- boat services, Indian food, night club action, herpes (presumably). We found a place with excellent food and Sangria, and passed a pleasant few days waiting for a good weather window.</p><p>We chose to leave on a Friday night where the forecast was for 20 knot winds on our beam. It turned out to be a night with 25 knots on the bow, which is a much, much more unpleasant sailing experience. But we plowed through the night with a double-reefed main and a bit of jib flying, with winds gusting to 30.</p><p>The seas kicked up, and it was uncomfortable and annoying, We had some miscommunication about who was latching hatches, so it was also wetter inside the boat than it should be. The waves were enough to spray up over the cabin fairly regularly.</p><p>Here's how it looked from the chart table in the middle of the night. Volume up, if you're where you can.</p><iframe width="872" height="491" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uLhMsYtoRgQ" title="" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe><p>Around sunrise, I was just getting up to end my night watch, and the auto pilot went out. We were still 20 miles away from Ibiza, and the wind was still coming from the direction we needed at an insane speed. I started the motor, and we plowed into the chop, hand steering through the cold salt spay for four hours.</p><p>When we arrived, we found that the anchor had shaken loose in storm and pounded the shit out of our bow. Our formerly beautifully painted bow. The shaking had also ripped the door to the forwardmost cabin right out of its frame.<br><br>It's been cold and windy in Ibiza, which doesn't help with the frustration. But in just a few days, we've made a lot of progress on repairs and cleanup, and in a couple more days, we'll be able to move along. A fiberglass guy is going to patch us up "good enough" so that we can move on safely, and then when we're in a place that's warmer and cheaper, we can haul out to complete the repair, sanding, and painting.</p><p>Most of my latest pictures are close ups of hull damage and steering mechanisms. I didn't even make a snap on the way to the laundromat.</p><p>First, a few pics from Palma, Mallorca:</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240220_082117_IMG_1717.jpg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240220_082117_IMG_1717.jpg" alt="/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240220_082117_IMG_1717.jpg" ><br><span class="caption"></span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240220_083920_IMG_1718.jpg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240220_083920_IMG_1718.jpg" alt="/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240220_083920_IMG_1718.jpg" ><br><span class="caption"></span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240221_121846_IMG_1738.jpg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240221_121846_IMG_1738.jpg" alt="/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240221_121846_IMG_1738.jpg" ><br><span class="caption"></span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240221_124429_IMG_1741.jpg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240221_124429_IMG_1741.jpg" alt="/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240221_124429_IMG_1741.jpg" ><br><span class="caption"></span></a><p>x</p><p>And not much from Ibiza, but there was at least a nice sunset in the marina.<br><br><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240225_184530_IMG_1802.jpg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240225_184530_IMG_1802.jpg" alt="/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240225_184530_IMG_1802.jpg" ><br><span class="caption"></span></a></p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240225_184737_IMG_1804.jpg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240225_184737_IMG_1804.jpg" alt="/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240225_184737_IMG_1804.jpg" ><br><span class="caption"></span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240226_091330_IMG_1805.jpg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240226_091330_IMG_1805.jpg" alt="/img/bigtrip/resIMG_20240226_091330_IMG_1805.jpg" ><br><span class="caption"></span></a><p>I'm not posting pictures of my damage just yet.

The marina in Riposto is right by where the the catch comes in every morning, and so just a block down and to the right is market after market of fresh fish right off the boat. We ate tuna and swordfish pretty much every day.</p><p>There was also good produce right there, along with butcher shops, bakeries, and miscellaneous stores with meats and cheeses. I suspect the neighborhood is still abuzz about how much food the American family with teenage boys bought while in town. One lady was shocked -- like, "are you sure you want that much?" -- when I ordered about a pound of mortadella.<br><br>One afternoon, after the fresh markets were closed and I was looking to stock up on wine, a car slowed down near me on the street.

We bashed into the wind all day. The sailing wasn't fun, so we tucked into a little cover on a small volcano north of Sicily and got a good night's sleep, followed by a great sail the next day. Another day yet, and we were to Sardinia.</p><p>We chose a marina in a quiet little town that is mostly shut down for the winter. We took a taxi into town and had a five-star meal, but other than that, it was mostly boat chores and laundry. Very pretty though, and it shows signs of being a happening place during the high season.</p><p>(Even more text after these pictures)</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_1681.jpeg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_1681.jpeg" alt="/img/bigtrip/resIMG_1681.jpeg" ><br><span class="caption"></span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_1682.jpeg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_1682.jpeg" alt="/img/bigtrip/resIMG_1682.jpeg" ><br><span class="caption"></span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_1699.jpeg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_1699.jpeg" alt="/img/bigtrip/resIMG_1699.jpeg" ><br><span class="caption"></span></a><p>Leaving on Saturday, we had ideal conditions for putting out the Code 0 (big, giant downwind sail at the very front of the boat). But I neglected to get any practice on closed-loop furlers, and as I pulled out sail, the furling mechanism was wrapping itself around the sail instead of just unfurling line like a drum furler would have. V and I went forward to get things untangled. but the wind had a good grip on the bit of the sail that had gotten let out. I asked for the boat to be steered into the wind so that the sail would luff, and when the boat turned, it went right over one of the sheets on that sail that was half deployed.</p><p>If you sailed to Cuba with us, or if you heard tales of our Cuba trip, this will sound familiar to you.</p><p>The line got caught in the prop (of course), which means no more motoring. We dropped the big sail to the deck and bungeed it into an ugly bundle. Then, under main sail alone, we sailed close to a pretty little beach and dropped anchor.</p><p>We had to find all of the components of the hookah dive system. I had secretly hoped to never use it again.</p><p>And the best advice that we got before leaving for this trip was to go buy a used wetsuit, just in case.</p><p>We got things sorted, and it took me forever to work up the nerve to swim under water. I kept going under and finding that I couldn't breathe. Eventually, it dawned on me that I was clenching my jaw so tight that I wasn't letting any air out.</p><p>The line wasn't on tight. I just had to unwrap it, maybe seven or eight times. I wasn't under the boat more than 75 seconds or so, probably, but I was nervous like I was diving a blue hole.</p><p>After that, we had a couple of drinks and enjoyed being anchored on a warm afternoon. Then, we put all of the gear back away, wrestled the sail and tangled lines into storage, and set off again. I'm tying this at 4:00 AM local time, and our beautiful weather window is over. There's no wind out here at all.</p><p>At some point, I'll do some technical videos about our sail rigging, but I have a lot left to learn first.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_9013.jpeg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/resIMG_9013.jpeg" alt="/img/bigtrip/resIMG_9013.jpeg" ><br><span class="caption"></span></a>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://theskinnyonbenny.com/big-trip/underway</guid><title>Underway</title><description>We shove off and set sail for home.</description><link>https://theskinnyonbenny.com/big-trip/underway</link><pubDate>Tue, 6 Feb 2024 14:31:00 -0600</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On Saturday morning, we finished buttoning up the boat, motored to the Izola fuel dock, and then motored over to the nearby town of Portrose to officially export the boat from Slovenia.

We had chartered similar boats, and we were excited to do some coastal cruising on our own schedule. As we grew our confidence, we started overnight passages and then venturing farther and farther offshore. And we might have sailed it a bit harder than she was meant to be sailed. Not in a dangerous way, but in the way of robustness.</p><p>I see that clearly now that we've moved aboard Hazagussa, the red Pegasus that you saw briefly in the last post. The Pegasus components -- sailing hardware especially, but pumps, hatches, and all sorts of minor pieces too look and feel so much bigger and sturdier.</p><p>The list of things that I never had to troubleshoot, replace, or repair on the Beneteau is as follows:</p><ul><li>any of the winches</li><li>water heater</li><li>a little pump at the bottom of the freezer to remove meltwater. However, the freezer was broken as often as not, so this pump didn't get put through the paces like the rest of the boat.</li></ul><p>So it's a little bit funny that the boat thing I've done most since we moved aboard is troubleshoot the water heater.</p><p>For most of us, it's not a big deal, because we're at the dock, and hot showers are a short walk away.<br><br>But I don't think I've written yet that one of our capable and able crew, namely Heather, is somewhat less capable with a broken ankle. The marina has accommodated us by allowing us to pull side-to on a long floating dock rather than make her try to cross a gangway. But getting on and off is an adventure, and it's not been the best weather, so she opted for an ice water shower.</p><p>Other than the hot water thing, living aboard again is so great. The salon is big and full of light, and we're all in here without being on top of each other during the rainy days. The cat has find a way to squirm under the salon table, and he has himself a little spot that floats him above strands of cabling. We'll have to put a blanket in that spot for him on Velvet Elvis.</p><p>We even cooked home made food yesterday for the first time since we arrived.</p><p>As I write, it's blowing out there:</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/IMG_20240119_112555_IMG_1315.jpg" data-lightview-caption="This shows that in the last hour, the average wind speed has been 19 kts, with gusts up to about 32." data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/IMG_20240119_112555_IMG_1315.jpg" alt="/img/bigtrip/IMG_20240119_112555_IMG_1315.jpg" ><br><span class="caption">This shows that in the last hour, the average wind speed has been 19 kts, with gusts up to about 32.</span></a><iframe width="1034" height="582" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aeep-JfdU-g" title="" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/IMG_20240119_100038_IMG_1314.jpg" data-lightview-caption="This is one of my favorite pictures that I've ever taken.

We're looking at some time next week before she's in the water, and then there's still a lot to do before we can put Slovenia behind us. But that's the nature of travel, and in particular of sailing. We definitely want everything to be right on the boat first.</p><p>We've gotten to go to the shop and do a lot of technical learning, and seeing how everything is being assembled is invaluable. And we have a company where the owners know where every wire is run and every hose is plumbed, and they seem eager to stay on the phone with us and get us where we want to be when we want to be there. Better yet, they know where to go in the Med and where to skip. It will be great to have them as a remote team helping us from shore.</p><p>We also met the owner of hull 9, <strong>Sine Finis</strong> which launched last week. Nice guy. He's going to leave it here and let us import into the US before following later in the year. I'm sure we'll see hime again.</p><p>Continuing the bad news, we've all been fighting a mild sickness. Fucking air travel. The up side of that is that we just sleep in our rental place, which I've named "the world's most dismal apartment." Tomorrow is move out day. I'll leave the details about where we're going for later in the week.<br><br>My pictures are a weird mix of tourist and technical. Here's a pretty mountain. Here's a compressor for the cockpit refrigerator. Here's the dog looking cute on a Pegasus that is not our Pegasus. I'm a bit at a loss for what to post.</p><p>I think I'm going to do some technical walk-through videos for the real nerds out there once we're aboard our own boat, so I'll save some of those pictures for then.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/slovenia-01-01.jpg" data-lightview-caption="How's that for a transom?" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/slovenia-01-01.jpg" alt="/img/slovenia-01-01.jpg" ><br><span class="caption">How's that for a transom?</span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/slovenia-01-02.jpg" data-lightview-caption="Doing school work in the cool little coffe shop next door to The World's Most Dismal Apartment™️" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/slovenia-01-02.jpg" alt="/img/slovenia-01-02.jpg" ><br><span class="caption">Doing school work in the cool little coffe shop next door to The World's Most Dismal Apartment™️</span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/slovenia-01-03.jpg" data-lightview-caption="Izola is a really pretty town." data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/slovenia-01-03.jpg" alt="/img/slovenia-01-03.jpg" ><br><span class="caption">Izola is a really pretty town.</span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/slovenia-01-04.jpg" data-lightview-caption="Rosie the Boat Dog isn't so sure about using the passerelle to get ashore." data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/slovenia-01-04.jpg" alt="/img/slovenia-01-04.jpg" ><br><span class="caption">Rosie the Boat Dog isn't so sure about using the passerelle to get ashore.</span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/slovenia-01-05.jpg" data-lightview-caption="Velvet Elvis's keel" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/bigtrip/slovenia-01-05.jpg" alt="/img/slovenia-01-05.jpg" ><br><span class="caption">Velvet Elvis's keel</span></a>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://theskinnyonbenny.com/big-trip/game-plan</guid><title>Game Plan</title><description>It's almost go time.

Boat school continues with combinations of visits to the boat yard and on board a sister ship in the marina at Izola.</p><p>Jan 12: Keel arrives at boat yard from the keel manufacturer. Ours is the first Pegasus with the shoal draft keel. This delivery is somewhat delayed, but the good folks at Pegasus are planning to keep it in the shop and do its prep work over the weekend.</p><p>Jan 15: Transport the boat to the ocean. This should be a big day with some good pictures.</p><p>Jan 16th &amp; 17th: Install keel, step the mast, install rigging, and get the boat into the water. Maybe not in that order.</p><p>Once the boat's in the water, we can start unloading the pallets of our stuff that we shipped up there and moving into the boat. We can also get to the starlink dish at this point and get it installed. We also start a series of test sails where we make sure everything is working, instruments are calibrated, etc.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://theskinnyonbenny.com/blog2/unseasonal-decorations</guid><title>Unseasonal Decorations</title><description>Now that I don't have to get a kid up and make him get ready for school, I can start my mornings with long walks with the dog.

Put them up once in early October, apply a minor tweak on the first weekend of November, and then leave it alone until early January. Soooo much less up-and-down with boxes of decorations.</p><p>I hereby challenge all decorations manufacturers to make things like this ubiquitous. Lights are obvious. One switch for orange. Flip it in November for white or red or green or blue It seems like fake spider webs could become fake snow banks pretty easily. Werewolves that become reindeer.

Photo unrelated to this story for the most part...</span></a><p>It's a painstaking task. I arrow-down one by one through about 10,000 pictures we take over the course of a year, and pick the best few hundred to include. I let the web site arrange them, but then I have to go in and move things around, group them more logically, and give more prominence to better pictures. I'm usually doing this at 2:00 in the morning.</p><p>One of the pictures I selected from after my Dec. 2022 cutoff date as a picture that my whole family took at my dad's graduation. He had finished up his PHD in music composition. Either by going with the auto-generated placement or by accidentally doing a small drag with the mouse, I absolutely botched the placement of this one.<br><br>I cut my dad (the graduate) out of the picture, but left in his advisor, who is just a total random stranger to all of the rest of us.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/botched-portrait.png" data-lightview-caption="That's Dad's graduation robe, over to the left." data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/botched-portrait.png" alt="/img/botched-portrait.png" width="650px"><br><span class="caption">That's Dad's graduation robe, over to the left.</span></a><p><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/greenline.gif" class="greenline" alt="{{divider}}" /></p><p>The week before Christmas, I baked some Christmas cookies. One of my favorites has been a fig cookie, where I make a filling of mixed figs, raisons, brandy, sugar, chopped nuts, and spices, roll it into a tube, surround that with cookie dough, slice into pieces, and bake.</p><p>I don't know what I did wrong on this one, but my dough was very close to being a batter instead. I ended up having trouble shaping the cookies, and then for some reason, I had a lot of leftover filling.</p><p>I found that I could roll the filling into the size and shape of one of Rosie's turds, and it would look 100% authentic. Then, I spent two days where everyone who would come over would have to see me swear about the dog turd on the floor, followed by me picking it up bare-handed and finally taking a bite.</p><p>I didn't take a picture, and I don't even deserve to have a web site any more.</p><p>The best reaction I got was from V, whose eyes went wide with shock when I picked up the fake turd. Once I took a bite, he laughed and called me a jerk. The bite really gave up the prank. I should have tossed it in the trash and then absent-mindedly licked my fingers.</p><p><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/greenline.gif" class="greenline" alt="{{divider}}" /></p><p>Listen to some of my dad's music:</p><iframe style="border: 0; width: 350px; height: 470px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2357875700/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/transparent=true/" seamless><a href="https://danschultz.bandcamp.com/album/selected-compositions">Selected Compositions by Dan Schultz</a></iframe><p>I'll add that you should listen more than once.

"But it's their hooooooommmmmmee," you whine. I can hear you. Outside of sailing forums, the people tend to be on the side of the orcas. The New York Times article about this week's sinking ends with this thought:</p><blockquote>But the ocean is the orcas’ home, and conservationists say scaring the animals is not a solution.
<br /><br />
“It is not about winning a battle, because this is not a war,” Mr. López said. “We need to be respectful.”</blockquote><p>So we don't see eye-to-eye.</p><p>A strategy that seems to be working is keeping to shallower water. No attacks have been recorded in depths less than about 60 feet. So we do that over there for sure.</p><p>We'll also crank up the human noises, to be as unpleasant as possible.</p><p>Oh, and that might be a good time to dump the cat's litter box. Orcas can't possibly want cat shit in their blow holes.</p><p>("Cat Shit in Their Blow Holes" is not a bad band name. You can have it for free.)</p><p>I also have this idea that if they come to our rudders, I switch to full-throttle reverse. First, if they're approaching from the stern, and the boat passes their head, they have to circle around to get back to them. Orcas don't have reverse, do they?</p><p>Second, in reverse, the motion of the boat and the suction of the prop are going to pull the orca toward the prop. They're too strong to suck them in to the prop and hurt them, but it might well be annoying.</p><p>But hopefully, we don't see the orcas at all.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://theskinnyonbenny.com/blog2/travel-update-site-update-social-butterfly</guid><title>Travel Update, Site Update, Social Butterfly</title><description>There are a lot of upcoming changes to the site, as I still try to get all of the old stuff re-posted.

That sounds like an improvement over the normal school restroom smells, but it was not.</p><p>Not long ago, my barber and I came up with the idea of poo-scented vape cartridges for the high school kids of today to use in their school restrooms. It's a punishment-proof way to vape, since no one will question that scent coming out of a restroom stall.</p><p>If either of us had any ambition, we'd be rich by now.</p><p>On a technical note, I don't think I've ever embedded an instagram post before, and the amount of text in their embed code is staggering. I bet half of this page that you're seeing is embed code. Probably a bunch of stuff that links you and me together in the algorithms, which is why every time you log on to the internet for the next couple of weeks, you'll see ads for Truck Nutz.</p><p>Update: all of that code just rendered a white rectangle with a link in the middle to take you off-page. I can do links myself, thank you very much.

    <li>On Sunday, I wanted the Saints not to blow a game where they had a 17 point lead in the fourth quarter.</li>
    <li>My youthful notions of winning a Hiesman trophy or Nobel Peace Prize (not even being picky about which) are in the rearview mirror.</li>
</ul><p>But I've never wanted anything as much as my little dog wants to catch a squirrel.</p><p>On Monday, I took her with me to work from a patio where I like to get coffee and start my day sometimes. A young, skinny squirrel came by, and it's either rabid, stupid, or the bravest little thing who hasn't learned that dogs are threats.

Let's call him bloody-lip. So we start a scene where main character mom goes to bloody-lip's house to talk to bloody-lip's parents. He tells us that his dad is out of town, and that his mom is around back having a tennis lesson. Main character mom walks around back and spys the other mom banging the tennis instructor.</p><p>And after that, they all go to school for that morning.<br><br>So their universe is bathed in broad daylight at like 6:00 AM, everyone is up, and the mom has a tennis lesson/sexual liaison scheduled for that early on a school day.</p><p>After school <em>on that very same day</em>, she goes back to that house for a giant party. In the course of the school day, they've set up the yard with tables and chairs, put up a huge stage with lights for live musicians, and had a giant nude sculpture of tennis-banging-mom carved from a block of ice.<br><br><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/penelope.jpg" data-lightview-caption="The company that sets up parties in this town does a killer job." data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/penelope.jpg" alt="/img/penelope.jpg" width="650px"><br><span class="caption">The company that sets up parties in this town does a killer job.</span></a></p><p>Then, they have 200 people over for a shindig when the husband is either still <em>out of town</em> or has just gotten back.</p><p>This is the worst example, but the dialog is full of things that real people wouldn't say. The acting isn't what you would call good, but it wouldn't be something I noticed if the writing wasn't so sloppy.</p><p>I'm sure twists and turns are coming. (Obviously, there's something to the girl's glasses. They beat you over the head that the mom gets her panties in a bunch if the girl takes them off.)</p><p>The best part for me is the song that the title put in my head. The song isn't in the show (at least not in the first 35 minutes), but I can hear it in my brain any time.<br><br>Erin Carter Erin Carter Erin Carter... Ooooooooohhh SHIT, Erin Carter.</p><p>If you've watched to the end, go ahead and spoil it for me.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://theskinnyonbenny.com/blog2/praising-the-lord-at-cirlcle-k</guid><title>Praising the Lord At Circle K</title><description>A bunch of nonsense about getting a drink at Circle K and then going to work from the library.

I had just been up a long time, finished my coffee, and wanted something cold to drink so I could sit outside to start my work day. I like sometimes to sit on the plaza outside of the main library. There is shade, power outlets, a steady trickle of people to watch, and a fountain for background white noise.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/work20230908.jpg" data-lightview-caption="At the library this morning." data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/work20230908.jpg" alt="/img/work20230908.jpg" width="650px"><br><span class="caption">At the library this morning.</span></a><p>But it's still so hot outside, even at 8:00 AM. So I need a drink.</p><p>While adding ice to the cup, there was a woman next to me filling her. She sounded very much like Aunt Esther from Sanford and Son when she exclaimed, "Thank you, Jesus!"</p><p>I was briefly possessed by Larry David. "I've got to ask... What is it with the coke machine here that's bringing you so much joy?"</p><p>I was expecting something like "there's been no syrup in the Dr Pepper dispenser for three days and now there is" or something like that.</p><p>But I got, "I'm just happy that God thought I should wake up this morning."</p><p>I guess, yeah, being alive hits for me too.</p><p>She started walking to the registers talking to herself about being alive, and that's what really answered my question: crazy.</p><p>If you have to be crazy, crazy and happy to be alive beats the shit out of crazy with demons. Last time I worked on the library's patio, I didn't stay long, because a guy behind me was ranting at an imaginary enemy. He repeated, "You're just a broke motherfucker. You about about to be a dead motherfucker." If he wasn't behind my back, he wouldn't have been scary, but then again, I didn't want to look up and make eye contact with him either. Color me as a guy who wants to stay on the "broke motherfucker" side of his ledger.</p><p>Getting back to Circle-K, the new robot check out things are the best new invention of 2023. Just stick your things under the hood, swipe the phone over the keypad, and you're out. No scanning, no nothing.

It's a nice break, because it's been as hot as it's ever been. This is rough for me. I'm not getting younger or skinnier.</p><p>The weekend was absolutely brutal. I went to pick up my temporarily (I'm sure) repaired Jeep, and I found North Louisiana to be full of hazy smoke. In the afternoon, we tried to sit outside and watch football, but it was just unbearable, even in the shade and the fans on. We went in and cooked all evening, like we do when it's too cold to be outside.</p><p>On Sunday morning, I could smell the smoke when I stepped outside. I drove early to Slidell, and the wildfire smoke just east of Baton Rouge was even worse than the smoke from the day before. I had to haul some heavy stuff from back where the boats are to my temporarily-repaired Jeep, and the heat had me wheezing. I was about an inch from puking. When I was finished, I checked the temperature, and it was 106. Definitely the hottest weather I've ever tried to be active in. And hopefully, the hottest ever again.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/smoky.jpg" data-lightview-caption="Sunday morning was smoky as hell just outside of Baton Rouge." data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/smoky.jpg" alt="/img/smoky.jpg" width="650px"><br><span class="caption">Sunday morning was smoky as hell just outside of Baton Rouge.</span></a><p>After that, there was a Krewe of Lyonesse pool party.

It saves me an hour in the morning, with a shorter drive, but more importantly, with not getting stuck in a neighborhood with two ways in and out along with 1000 other parents trying to drive the same roads at the same time.</p><p>It changes up my routine. There's a coffee shop two blocks away, and I've been going there a lot of mornings to start my work day. I've come to like the regulars. There's a samall group of dudes who seem to span every race, age, and income level who sit out there, smoke cigars, and yuck it up starting at 8:00 am. When there's no one at the counter, the staff is out there with us too.</p><p>I'm down there early enough to park alongside the curb right in front of the store. I have yet to pay the newly-installed parking meters down there. We all know that the ticket writers here don't work in bad weather, and it's hotter than the devil's taint out here, even that early in the morning.</p><p>After working for a few hours today, I had the table covered with laptops, an ipad where I was making notes, my phone (the <a href="https://knowledgefight.libsyn.com/841-like-a-pearl-before-a-swine" target="_blank">Kowledge Fight podcast today</a> was a lot of fun), and my coffee. I was about 20 minutes into a Teams call for work, and I saw the meter maid working his way up the street.</p><p>It was instantly a mad scramble. I was stuffing shit into my bag willy-nilly, sloshing coffee all over myself. My hurried hands couldn't find the dexterity to untie the dog from the table, and when I was finally into a position to bolt, I nearly darted out in front of a car and killed the dog and me both. Rather be dead than have a $20 ticket, apparently.</p><p>By the fact that I had time to type this out, you may have already concluded that I lived. And, I did not get a ticket. And, my call was on mute, so it all happened with my colleagues blissfully unaware.</p><p>I would love to know what the cigar-smoking regulars thought of my mad dash.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://theskinnyonbenny.com/blog2/driving-blues</guid><title>Driving Blues</title><description>It's been a lot of driving lately.

Around sunset, it the traffic got better. From Northern Virginia to home was another really long slog, fed by Red Bull and Twizzlers, which leaves you feeling shitty for a couple of days from there.</p><p>Then -- I don't know if you've heard about this -- it's hot as hell in the south right now.</p><p>Last weekend, it was up and back to Natchitoches to get our cars and our parents' cars back where they belong, but the issue that lead us to abandon my truck for the summer trip had returned, so it's still in the shop up there.

The owner of the restaurant got on the phone, and in a few minutes, we had an appointment and a reasonable price for a drive who would cart us around and put up with us gradually getting more and more wine-drunk.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/gal/175%2520-%2520Europe%25202022%2520pt%25202%2520-%2520Coastal%2520Croatia/resIMG_20220530_120010_IMG_8255_HEIC.jpg" data-lightview-caption="Wine tasting with a view." data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/gal/175%2520-%2520Europe%25202022%2520pt%25202%2520-%2520Coastal%2520Croatia/resIMG_20220530_120010_IMG_8255_HEIC.jpg" alt="/gal/175%20-%20Europe%202022%20pt%202%20-%20Coastal%20Croatia/resIMG_20220530_120010_IMG_8255_HEIC.jpg" width="650px"><br><span class="caption">Wine tasting with a view.</span></a><p>(I'm digressing, but Croatian white wine is so good. To me, it's completely different that what we get here -- crisp without being sweet somehow. I highly recommend.)</p><p>On the way to one of our early stops. Mrs. theskinnyonbenny asked about uniquely Croatian experiences that we should seek out. He told us to find a place that would make a peka. It's a traditional roast, where a meat gets put into an iron pot with vegetables, set directly into hot coals, and left to cook slowly all day.</p><p>Fast forward a few days, and at a seaside restaurant in Hvar, the waitresses checked with the kitchen and came back excited to tell us what time to return the following night for an octopus peka.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/gal/175%2520-%2520Europe%25202022%2520pt%25202%2520-%2520Coastal%2520Croatia/resIMG_20220603_185903_IMG_8387_HEIC.jpg" data-lightview-caption="Restaurant view" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/gal/175%2520-%2520Europe%25202022%2520pt%25202%2520-%2520Coastal%2520Croatia/resIMG_20220603_185903_IMG_8387_HEIC.jpg" alt="/gal/175%20-%20Europe%202022%20pt%202%20-%20Coastal%20Croatia/resIMG_20220603_185903_IMG_8387_HEIC.jpg" width="650px"><br><span class="caption">Restaurant view</span></a><p>We arrived at our appointed time the next night and were ushered to the best table in the house, overlooking all of the boats anchored in the harbor. The same server brought us two shot glasses of some horrible licorice-tasting Mediterranean liqueur. We didn't know if it was a shot or a sipper. I chose to shoot it and get it over with. We quickly ordered a bottle of Croatian white to wash that taste away.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/gal/175%2520-%2520Europe%25202022%2520pt%25202%2520-%2520Coastal%2520Croatia/resIMG_20220603_191514_IMG_8397_HEIC.jpg" data-lightview-caption="Peka" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/gal/175%2520-%2520Europe%25202022%2520pt%25202%2520-%2520Coastal%2520Croatia/resIMG_20220603_191514_IMG_8397_HEIC.jpg" alt="/gal/175%20-%20Europe%202022%20pt%202%20-%20Coastal%20Croatia/resIMG_20220603_191514_IMG_8397_HEIC.jpg" width="650px"><br><span class="caption">Peka</span></a><p>After that, we got to go visit the kitchen. We saw the pot in the coals, and the chef opened it up to show us our octopus and vegetables. He had swum out into the harbor and caught the octopus before adding it to the pot.</p><p>The whole pot got placed center-table, and we cut it up and dished it out. The meat had the texture of a scallop, and a little of that sweet-seafood flavor, but also with a rich, beefy flavor. It was very very good.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/gal/175%2520-%2520Europe%25202022%2520pt%25202%2520-%2520Coastal%2520Croatia/resIMG_20220603_204612_IMG_8400_HEIC.jpg" data-lightview-caption="Our chef and his co-worker, who were familiar with the interstate exit they would take to come to our house.

He brought his girlfriend over to meet us (she was working in the same restaurant), and she had gone to University there with him too.

Friends join us, and I come to the conclusion that a great deal of the fun I have in publishing these posts lies in making fun of my friends.</description><link>https://theskinnyonbenny.com/blog2/summer-2023-trip-part-3</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Jul 2023 19:50:00 -0500</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nope, I'm still not home yet. Here's the latest log:</p><p><strong>July 12</strong>: We spent the day doing more exploring of Cape Breton, but mostly by car, and mostly through bad weather. I've had about enough of cold fog and drizzle by the end of this day.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/IMG_0658.jpeg" data-lightview-caption="Cape Breton" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/IMG_0658.jpeg" alt="/img/IMG_0658.jpeg" width="650px"><br><span class="caption">Cape Breton</span></a><p><strong>July 13</strong>: We left Cape Breton and drove a couple hours away to the prettiest house I've ever stayed in. It belongs to a friend/client, and she offered us a chance to dry out and enjoy the view while we were in the area. The kids made Mrs. theskinnyonbenny dinner for her birthday. It was a nice time.</p><p><strong>July 14</strong>: Our (borrowed) truck wouldn't start at all, so I called a tow truck and got it to a dealership in town. They were really busy and didn't have time for me, but they listened to my sob story (I might have mentioned a family of four sleeping on the floor of their local bus station that night), and they drove to a town an hour away for a part and got me out of there that day. The rest of the family got to enjoy that beautiful house. I got to enjoy fluorescent lights and a tile floor in a dealership waiting room. Not complaining though -- the trip moves on.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/IMG_7833.jpeg" data-lightview-caption="View from my favorite house.  When we speculated on what we would do with all of our winnings should the Powerball or Mega Millions hit, we decided we would 1) Make sure Red Stick Cares is funded forever, and 2) buy this house no matter what the price." data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/IMG_7833.jpeg" alt="/img/IMG_7833.jpeg" width="650px"><br><span class="caption">View from my favorite house.

We did laundry and camper cleaning, and then late, Crystal showed up with her three kids and her nephew.</p><p><strong>July 16 - 21</strong>: Beach days, cooking dinner, hang out by fire pit. We added our friends Lisa and Linda, and Camilla's friend Katie for various days during the week. On July 17, Ko left us for <a href="https://ghostlighttheatercamp.com" target="_blank">Ghostlight Theater Camp</a>. He's avoiding the camp photographer pretty well, but it seems like he's having fund when he does pop up on their photo galleries.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/3O0A7702.jpg" data-lightview-caption="One of the camp pics." data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/3O0A7702.jpg" alt="/img/3O0A7702.jpg" width="650px"><br><span class="caption">One of the camp pics.</span></a><p>We really ate well for a group that never did dinner at a restaurant. We had curry one night, steaks and kababs, a huge eggplant lasagna that I'm still craving more of, and lobster rolls. Oh, and we put a dent in all of the salmon that we've been packing since our big catch on Lake Superior.</p><p>We did go bar hopping one night, if you can call it that when there's one bar in town open as late as midnight. They were having karaoke, and there was a bachelorette party going on. Don't you know that someone joined them all on stage?</p><iframe width="786" height="801" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pLzk2Wi-kjc" title="Crystal Sings with the Party Girls" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe><p>I've been using this space to make fun of Crystal since I spun it up in 2004, and the fact that I can still be doing that makes me happy for all the work that I've put in to bringing back current. (Still a lot to do, but I'm camping by myself, so hopefully I can make a lot of progress this week or next.)</p><p><strong>July 22</strong>: We packed up and went out to find a campsite to spend a couple of weeks. I ended up in the White Mountains of New Hampshire, in a site that isn't particularly scenic, but it's a two minute walk to a pretty river, and a five minute drive to places to paddleboard or hike. I'm mostly catching up on work, but I'm going to try to do some fun stuff while I'm here.</p><p><strong>July 23</strong>: We got up, and pretty much right away drove V and H to Boston. Having attempted it two years in a row, I will declare that it is impossible to drop someone off at a Boston airport hotel without missing a turn and having to spend an extra 30 to 60 minutes winding through a spaghetti mess of streets, bridges, and tunnels. If I never drive to Logan again, it will be too soon.</p><p>After that, I bought groceries and liquor, made dinner, started a camp fire, drank a scotch, and watched my ipad by the fire pit.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/IMG_0696.jpeg" data-lightview-caption="River view from the campground where I'll be spending the next couple of weeks." data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/IMG_0696.jpeg" alt="/img/IMG_0696.jpeg" width="650px"><br><span class="caption">River view from the campground where I'll be spending the next couple of weeks.</span></a><p><strong>July 24</strong>: Mostly work from camp, but explore a little. I found a really pretty little lake close by, and I'm excited to blow up the paddle board and get out on the water for an hour or so tomorrow.</p><p>So right now, V and H are at home, and I think they have my mom's car from Slidell. Ko is at camp in Maine. I'm in New Hampshire with the dog, using my mother-in-law's car, and both of our cars plus our cat are at my monther-in-law's house in Natchitoches. I'm not sure how we unwind all of this, but I have a couple of weeks before we have to worry about it.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://theskinnyonbenny.com/blog2/summer-2023-trip-part-2</guid><title>Summer 2023 Trip, Part 2</title><description>We continued to travel north and east, to the point now where we're just about out of continent.

Hopefully better weather tomorrow.<br><br><h3>Captain's Log</h3></p><p><strong>July 4</strong>: Quebec City - I walked around the city by myself all morning. Hills kicked my ass, but it was a pretty day in a pretty city. Once the fam was up, we had a two-hour long French lunch at a sidewalk table. Really nice. After that, we drove to Fundy National Park, getting there very late.</p><p><strong>July 5</strong>: We woke up to a rainy day at the park, so we mostly stayed near the campsite. We did venture out to some scenic overlooks and whatnot.</p><p><strong>July 6</strong>: Fundy NP day. We ate in town, went to the pool which overlooks the ocean, and checked in frequently on the tides. The Bay of Fundy has the biggest tidal range in the world -- around 50 ft of up and down, twice a day. At high tide, the boats at the dock look normal. Halfway to low tide, they sit on a pile of mud. The sea continues to retreat, and at low tide, it must be a quarter mile out from the high water mark.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/IMG_0584.jpeg" data-lightview-caption="Low Tide, but it looks like this for several hours before and after." data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/IMG_0584.jpeg" alt="/img/IMG_0584.jpeg" width="650px"><br><span class="caption">Low Tide, but it looks like this for several hours before and after.</span></a><p><strong>July 7</strong>: More play at the park. We did some paddle boarding on a pretty lake and then took in some more pool time.</p><p><strong>July 8</strong>: Drive to Prince Edward Island and start eating nonstop. We knew PEI oysters were good because there are some fancy oyster places in Louisiana that fly them in. But eating them for cheap where they are fresh out of the water was amazing. We ate four dozen oysters over the course of the day, each dozen at a different place. We also followed them with local mussels, lobsters, and scallops. Such a great day.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/IMG_0616.jpeg" data-lightview-caption="PEI Marina" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/IMG_0616.jpeg" alt="/img/IMG_0616.jpeg" width="650px"><br><span class="caption">PEI Marina</span></a><p><strong>July 9</strong>: We hung out around PEI all morning, and then found that the ferry to Nova Scotia was out. That meant we sat in traffic to use the one toll bridge all afternoon, and then had a much longer drive around to Cape Breton, Nova Scotia.</p><p><strong>July 10</strong>: Cape Breton NP. And a long drive up to the tip of the cape to take in extremes in scary roads and scenery.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/IMG_0639.jpeg" data-lightview-caption="A cool campground at the end of the road on Cape Breton.

We went to town for lunch, like every other camper in the park.

For a couple of reasons, including a big one that will just piss me off if I get into it, we got off a couple of weeks later than we had wanted to. But one of the upsides is that we had the College World Series to listen to while we waited and then while we drove.</p><p>For Monday's final, we were on the Michigan Upper Peninsula.</p><p>The universe had been dropping hints that I should be confident. During that day, we passed streets named "Tiger Way" and "Championship Drive." When we sat down at the only sports bar in Saint Ignace, Michigan, the table next to us (completely unaware of the game) had two little girls -- one in a purple dress, and one in a canary yellow dress.</p><p>They weren't the only ones uninterested in the game. The big central tv was tuned to some sitcom rerun. The speakers just played music. They tuned one corner TV to the game for us and sat us over there where we could see.</p><p>Once the dinner crowd was gone, we moved to the bar, and they did put on the audio for the last couple of innings. The staff started having fun with us. I don't think we converted anyone to being new college baseball fans, but they were at least happy for us.</p><p>I started writing this post last week, but we've been on the move. Here's a quick log of our trip so far, and just a few of my favorite pictures. More later, or maybe not -- who knows.</p><h3>Captain's Log</h3><p><strong>June 24</strong>: Leave Natchitoches. Visit Graceland. Drive well into Illinois listening to the LSU/Wake Forest baseball game stream, which is the best pitching battle ever played in a college baseball game.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/IMG_0395.jpeg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/IMG_0395.jpeg" alt="/img/IMG_0395.jpeg" width="650px"><br><span class="caption"></span></a><p><strong>June 25</strong>: Chicago. Hang with our friends Harry and Janet. Janet came down to New Orleans in January before Covid. I don't even know how long it's been since we've seen Harry, but they haven't changed a bit. We hung at the marina (non-sailers will think this is funny, but it was too windy to sail), ate deep dish, and stayed overnight on their awesome little boat.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/IMG_0439.jpeg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/IMG_0439.jpeg" alt="/img/IMG_0439.jpeg" width="650px"><br><span class="caption"></span></a><p><strong>June 26</strong>: Drive to Straits State Park campground in Michigan Upper Penensula.

Omaha is also always the location of the College World Series. At Rocco's, visiting fans can specify their favorite team when they order a jello shot, and Rocco's keeps a leaderboard that tallies the number of shots bought by each fan base.</p><p>The previos record belonged to Ole Miss, who won both the on-field championship and the one at Rocco's last year. If memory serves, they put up a couple hundred shy of 19,000.</p><p>As I type, the leaderboard looks like this:</p><a class="lightview alignright" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/roccos-board.jpg" data-lightview-caption="Latest leaderboard at the time of this post.

</table><p>It was a given that the LSU crowd would come in to town and set the record. The city of Omaha and LSU fans have had this love affair going back to the 90s. LSU would show up big and spend big in bars and restaurants, an in return, they received fantastic hospitality. There are hundreds of LSU fans at the College World Series every year, even when LSU doesn't make it that far.</p><p>Second of all, this is a naturally heavy-drinking fan base. You know those self-assessments that ask you questions to see if you might be an alcoholic? They point to highly problematic for the most casual social drinker in South Louisiana. Seattle bars doubled-up on their orders when LSU played UW there several years ago, but by Saturday night, there wasn't a drop of burbon or vodka to be found in the city.</p><p>And third, the record was by a rival. Ole Miss, holding a record on our thing, on what we consider to be our turf? Couldn't possibly stand.</p><p>Now here's my beef.</p><p>Buying liquor that you don't plan to share or drink completely goes against the spirit of the Rocco's Jello Shot Challenge. And it goes against what we stand for as traveling fans.</p><p>The founder of Raising Cane's wanted to be a big shot, so he went in to Rocco's and ordered 6000 shots at once. I don't know how big a place Rocco's is, but I'm pretty sure that they weren't all consumed.</p><p>So I'm mentally subtracting 6000 from LSU's total. We should still hold the record by the end of the day if we don't already.</p><p>Now let's talk about what's up with Tennessee and Florida getting beat by two Christian schools.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://theskinnyonbenny.com/blog2/starlink</guid><title>Starlink</title><description>Starlink is changing everything, and some of the sailors are maaaaaaddd about it.</description><link>https://theskinnyonbenny.com/blog2/starlink</link><pubDate>Thu, 8 Jun 2023 15:29:00 -0500</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>2023 is the year that I first realized that I was seeing live posts and updates from boats in the middle of the ocean.<br><br>Not only do we land-based dreamers get to follow along, boats that run into trouble hundreds of miles from shore can get in contact with other nearby boats for help. <a href="https://www.worldcruising.com/featuresarticle.aspx?page=S638056656088518963&ArchiveID=4&CategoryID=186&ItemID=272408&src=" target="_blank">A boat crossing the Atlantic this winter lost their mast</a>.

They were rescued the same day.<br><br>On our (much shorter) crossings, we have had Iridium Go, which allows a choppy phone signal, text messaging, and is just barely good enough to get weather data while at sea. We had one pretty harrowing experience in a storm, and I used it to call the Coast Guard. I told them that we were safe, but that if they started getting a signal from our EPIRB, that it might be an actual emergency.</p><p>(And it goes without saying that this device wasn't working on our 2021 Bahamas trip. We kept close to shore for the most part.)</p><p>But I'm more than excited to add Starlink to the cruising arsenal. We tested a unit over Spring Break. While camping in a National Forest, out of cell coverage, I was able to do video calls with work while Mrs. theskinnyonbenny live streamed the Murdaugh murder trial. To say that this technology is a game-changer is a huge understatement.</p><p>But the sailors who just hop back and forth between Ft.

There were at least two things that I'll remember about that island forever, and a funny story to go with them.  Here's a post about sailing in 2021 that isn't all disasters.</description><link>https://theskinnyonbenny.com/blog2/long-island-happy-times</link><pubDate>Wed, 31 May 2023 14:40:00 -0500</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As I mentioned when we last gathered, there are lots of reasons to spend time on Long Island, Bahamas</p><h2>North Part of the Island</h2><p>If you drive the main road all the way up to the northernmost point of the island, you'll get to a monument that recognizes both Christopher Columbus, for landing there first, and the indigenous people who would soon be extinct, due in no small part to European genocide. That's not the fun part, although the views are fantastic.</p><p>Right beside there, there's a really nice spot for a swim, and you can probably have it all to yourself.</p><p>This alone would be worth the trip.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/gal/169%2520-%2520Summer%25202021%2520Pt%25203%2520-%2520Long%2520Island%2520and%2520Lizards/resIMG_20210704_121545_IMG_2248.jpg" data-lightview-caption="Beach on North Point of Long Island" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/gal/169%2520-%2520Summer%25202021%2520Pt%25203%2520-%2520Long%2520Island%2520and%2520Lizards/resIMG_20210704_121545_IMG_2248.jpg" alt="/img/gal/169%20-%20Summer%202021%20Pt%203%20-%20Long%20Island%20and%20Lizards/resIMG_20210704_121545_IMG_2248.jpg"  ><br><span class="caption">Beach on North Point of Long Island</span></a><p>On your way back in, there's a real resort. It's not a must-see destination, but if it would be nice after your swim to sit at a table and be served rum punch, it's there for you.</p><p>The abandoned resort is kind of cool too. There's a boardwalk through a rocky shore that's a nice, nice walk. The abandoned bar will tease you though if you work up a thirst for another rum punch.</p><h2>Cold Beer Lane</h2><p>While driving down a dirt/sand/gravel spur, there was a sign pointing down an even lesser used road that read, "Cold Beer Lane". We're explorers, so of course we took the detour. It lead to a small little restaurant. We walked up, but it was locked up.</p><p>But as we turned to leave, someone opened the door and insisted that we come in. Music turned on, cold beer was served, and we drank beer and traded stories with a couple of locals. The guy serving us was a songwriter, and he set me up with a way to download his music, which is still on my phone. The other guy had a girlfriend in Louisiana who ignored our text messages. If the kids hadn't been bored out of their minds, we might have stayed until nightfall.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/gal/169%2520-%2520Summer%25202021%2520Pt%25203%2520-%2520Long%2520Island%2520and%2520Lizards/resIMG_20210704_134508_S0463060_JPG.jpg" data-lightview-caption="Down Cold Beer Lane" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/gal/169%2520-%2520Summer%25202021%2520Pt%25203%2520-%2520Long%2520Island%2520and%2520Lizards/resIMG_20210704_134508_S0463060_JPG.jpg" alt="/img/gal/169%20-%20Summer%202021%20Pt%203%20-%20Long%20Island%20and%20Lizards/resIMG_20210704_134508_S0463060_JPG.jpg"  ><br><span class="caption">Down Cold Beer Lane</span></a><h2>My Man Earnest</h2><p>Two of my Long Island experiences were so wonderful and unique that I don't have any hope of replicating them.

And it was just us, and a little building with a bar.<br><br>The bartender's name was Earnest. He apparently grew up right there, and he definitely worked on island time. A super nice guy, but it took at least 15 minutes to get a beer, a rum punch, and two cokes. He kept track of our drinks with a pencil and spiral notebook, and his glacial pace made it easy for us to do the math to figure out whether our cash would hold out or not.</p><p>Eventually, a couple of other locals came in for a drink, and he was just as slow for them.<br><br>Here's the kicker: a cruise ship was scheduled to stop on Long Island for the first time a few days later. Earnest had been told to expect around 500 guests.<br><br>Mrs. theskinnyonbenny tried to coach him up: have 100 gallons of rum punch made and ready. Have all of the beers cold and easy to get to. Cash only. Cash, drinks, next. Cash, drinks, next.<br><br>If we didn't have to leave the next day to meet friends in Georgetown (and it turns out, we didn't), we would have stuck around and worked the bar for Earnest.</p><p>But the highlight, of course, is that beach. I haven't seen one prettier, and I might never.</p><h2>Dean's Blue Hole</h2><p>I've saved the best experience for last.<br><br>Dean's Blue Hole is this spot right off the beach where the shallow turquoise water drops straight down, so there's this deep circle of dark blue right in the middle. When we visited, there were teams of free divers practicing.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/gal/169%2520-%2520Summer%25202021%2520Pt%25203%2520-%2520Long%2520Island%2520and%2520Lizards/resIMG_20210703_100510_S0872132_JPG.jpg" data-lightview-caption="Terrible picture of Dean's Blue Hole" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/gal/169%2520-%2520Summer%25202021%2520Pt%25203%2520-%2520Long%2520Island%2520and%2520Lizards/resIMG_20210703_100510_S0872132_JPG.jpg" alt="/img/gal/169%20-%20Summer%202021%20Pt%203%20-%20Long%20Island%20and%20Lizards/resIMG_20210703_100510_S0872132_JPG.jpg"  ><br><span class="caption">Terrible picture of Dean's Blue Hole</span></a><p>I wish I had better pictures of this, but this was the stop where the water camera decided to take on moisture and fog up from the inside, rendering it useless. But let me tell you about what we can all only envision.</p><p>I swam over to the edge of the hole to watch the divers. One dive in particular. The diver took a deep breath and started swimming straight down, kicking with huge flippers on her feet. I watched her get smaller and smaller against the field of dark blue. At some depth, she started to look like CGI. After she was about the size of a grain of rice to my eye, she disappeared into the deep altogether.</p><p>I waited. And waited. And waited. And no diver.</p><p>I looked up at her teammates, resting on a floating platform above it all. They looked totally disinterested.</p><p>I looked back down, and nothing. More nothing. Still nothing.</p><p>I looked up again. It had been minutes. Many minutes, it seemed. Aren't they worried? I didn't come to see someone die down here.</p><p>After another eternity, she appeared as a speck, pushing herself toward the surface with those flippers.</p><p>It's probably the most amazing thing I've ever seen a human being do in person.<br><br><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/gal/169%2520-%2520Summer%25202021%2520Pt%25203%2520-%2520Long%2520Island%2520and%2520Lizards/resIMG_20210702_175509_IMG_2209.jpg" data-lightview-caption="One more just to show that there were also people on this trip." data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/gal/169%2520-%2520Summer%25202021%2520Pt%25203%2520-%2520Long%2520Island%2520and%2520Lizards/resIMG_20210702_175509_IMG_2209.jpg" alt="/img/gal/169%20-%20Summer%202021%20Pt%203%20-%20Long%20Island%20and%20Lizards/resIMG_20210702_175509_IMG_2209.jpg"  ><br><span class="caption">One more just to show that there were also people on this trip.</span></a></p><p>You've seen this link before, but <a href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/gal/169" target="_blank">more pics here</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://theskinnyonbenny.com/blog2/dont-worry-about-long-island-robbers</guid><title>Don’t Worry About Long Island Robbers</title><description>We were at Great Exuma that Summer just before Fourth of July weekend.

Not ideal, but it kept the batteries up so that we could get around, navigate, and generally function.</p><p>Until it didn't.</p><p>As engines will do, this one tore up its impeller. I tore the boat apart looking for the spares that I knew I had on board, but I could not find them. I did find a shop in Nassau that had them in stock and who would ship a couple to Georgetown for an extravagant fee.</p><p>The next morning Mrs. thekinnyonbenny and V went to the airport to retrieve our parts, while I tried to keep the only head (toilet) on board in semi-working condition. It's pumps' gaskets were only slightly more reliable than the engine impeller.</p><p>I believe that someone must have bought my parts an actual ticket on the plane, because the cost was up there. And it had to be paid in cash. This took up the bulk of the cash we had on hand.</p><p>I made the repair, and early the next morning, we were on our way to Long Island (the Bahamian one, not the one south of Connecticut.)</p><p>It was a couple hour sail, where we had good wind and a little rain, but no real trouble. We headed in toward a marina that was associated with a resort on the Northern part of the island, according to our cruising guide.</p><p>It turned out that the marina was a ghost town.</p><p>We poked around a bit, and walked up the road a little to see if there was a resort in shouting distance. But there wasn't, and eventually, we piled back into Velvet Elvis and sailed over the shallowest sand we could possibly have floated above.

I think it's a tad under 100 miles long, and all of the places to eat and things to see and do are spread up and down the entire length. So renting a car is a necessity.</p><p>The island's car rental place was coincidentally right where we came ashore, and in no time, we had reserved a car for the long weekend. The catch is that like everything else on Long Island, it's cash-only.</p><p>You can see where this is headed.</p><p>On our first full day with the car, we drove to both banks on the island. Both ATMs were out of service. As we drove up and down doing other things, we tried several other ideas -- cash back at the grocery, hardware store, and gas stations was a no. There was a little truck-stop style casino, and you couldn't get cash there either. We drove North to find "the resort", and we found a strange, abandoned resort with cabins from the 70s but where the grass was mowed. No ATM though.</p><p>It started to get stressful. You see, we didn't actually have enough cash left to pay for the rental car.</p><p>In asking around, we were told that at least one beachside bar and grill took Paypal as payment. It is called Tiny's, and I was disappointed to find that it wasn't run by a 6 foot 4, 320 pound Bahamian that everyone called Tiny. It was a nice little place with a good view. Conversation flowed between tourists and locals alike. Best of all, we didn't have to count pennies because of the Paypal thing.</p><p>Mrs. theskinnyonbenny told the host about our predicament and offered a fee for a Paypal cash advance. He declined, so we ordered another drink and resolved ourselves to turn in the car early and head back to Georgetown the next day.</p><p>But then as we were leaving, his wife came out, and made the PayPal cash advance happen. I think that she even declined to take a big fee on it (which was nice, because I bet our bar tab was more than our college era monthly rent).</p><a class="lightview alignright" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/gal/169%2520-%2520Summer%25202021%2520Pt%25203%2520-%2520Long%2520Island%2520and%2520Lizards/resIMG_20210702_191642_IMG_2215.jpg" data-lightview-caption="Hanging out at Tiny's" data-lightview-group="group1" style="width:350px;"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/gal/169%2520-%2520Summer%25202021%2520Pt%25203%2520-%2520Long%2520Island%2520and%2520Lizards/resIMG_20210702_191642_IMG_2215.jpg" alt="/img/gal/169%20-%20Summer%202021%20Pt%203%20-%20Long%20Island%20and%20Lizards/resIMG_20210702_191642_IMG_2215.jpg"><br><span class="caption">Hanging out at Tiny's</span></a><p>And that, my friends, is why you won't be robbed by gunmen in Long Island who want you to take money out of the ATM and hand it over to them.</p><p>It's a good thing that our stay was saved, because there were some absolute highlights of the entire trip, including a couple of things that would have been bucket-list things had I known they existed. This post is getting long, so I'll write up some Long Island highlights for the next.</p><p>One more disaster to recount from these days though before I get into a positive place.</p><p>Long Island was the only place in the Bahamas that had cell towers but where our hotspot did not work. We got there on the last work day of the month, which meant that Mrs. theskinnyonbenny had urgent accounting to be completed. So we dinghyed ashore with backpack-offices in tow to find a restaurant with wifi.</p><p>Meanwhile, our swim platform was down. Also, the motor that brings it up and down was broken -- because of course it was -- so it had a line tied from the swim ladder to a winch so that we could raise and lower it.<br><br>When we returned, it was dark, and Mrs. theskinnyonbenny tripped over that out-of-place line. The laptop bag went right into the drink. It was the 2nd Macbook ruined by seawater in just a few weeks. It joined an ipad and a Kindle reader, along with tens of thousands of dollars worth of boat electronics in the circuit board graveyard that was this trip.</p><p>Happier tales of Long Island next week!</p><p>PS, I wrote about other bits of our star-crossed summer <a href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/blog2/archives/2289">here</a> and <a href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/blog2/archives/2284">here</a>, but there is actually a lot more to tell.

I could probably be less vague if I read the article that I linked there, but I'm not gonna.</p><p>Anyway, more than one Dubliner heard our hillbilly American accents, and naturally asked if we were in town with the presidential delegation.</p><p>That was annoying, but more annoying was how often the radio played Coolio's Gangsta Paradise. I would guess that no song has ever been that big a hit in Ireland before or since. At first it was funny, as I had no notion as a stupid young American that anyone across the pond had even been exposed to hip-hop. But were they ever exposed.</p><p>This week, I see headlines pop up about the Inflation Reduction Act (which I know even less about than Irish terrorism), and some of the headlines call it the "IRA". IRA was also the name of the Irish terrorist bomber organization, and thus, I'm reminded of our Ireland trip.</p><p>And that, my friends, is why I can't get Gangsta Paradise out of my head this week.</p><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/greenline.gif" class="greenline" alt="{{divider}}" /><p>In some alternate universe, I started music blogging in 2004 instead of writing about asinine things that I had on my mind back then. In that universe, I can was on for hours about the genius of some indy band that no one ever heard of, and I have a show on Sirius XMU that airs at 2:00 AM every Sunday.</p><p>In that universe, I am very poor.</p><p>At one point last year, I decided that I was going to listen to all of <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/best-albums-of-all-time-1062063/marvin-gaye-whats-going-on-4-1063232/">Rolling Stone's top 500 albums of all time</a>, and write up a sentence or two about them. I ended up hating -- and I mean absolutely hating like you hate dead bunny rabbits -- albums number 2 and 3.<br><br>I know it's my own shortcoming. There are artists that I adore who talk about those albums inspiring them to make music. But I made myself listen to them 3 or 4 times each, and it was self-torture.</p><p>Album #4 was Stevie Wonder's <em>Songs in they Key of Life</em> which I loved so much that I abandoned my project before making it 1% of the way in and listened to Stevie's lifetime of work instead. And the first time I listened to <em>Songs in the Key of Life</em> all the way through, I found out that Gangsta Paradise is just Coolio rapping on top of Stevie's Pastime Paradise. So maybe that's really the song stuck in my head.</p><p>I swear, sometimes these posts wrap themselves up without me even having to try. .</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://theskinnyonbenny.com/blog2/pitches</guid><title>Pitches</title><description>I have some great ideas for TV shows that they should make.</description><link>https://theskinnyonbenny.com/blog2/pitches</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 May 2023 10:42:00 -0500</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last night, we watched <em>My Cousin Vinnie</em>. Probably the first time I've seen it since the 90s, and it turns out that the reason it was so popular is that it's good. It's still good. I didn't remember much other than the main plot outline, and it had me laughing.</p><p>Not just the big moments -- like when Vinnie came into court wearing the thrift shop suit, but also ones that could go unnoticed if you're playing on your phone while it's on. In one court scene, the prosecutor mentions "all our little old ancestors bank in England." As he speaks, the camera panning the jury stops for an extra beat on the face of a black lady who could have had a best supporting nomination just for the look on her face during that 1.5 seconds of screen time.</p><p>How about instead of <a href="https://variety.com/2023/tv/news/matlock-reboot-elsbeth-poppas-house-series-cbs-1235607934/" target="_blank">rebooting Matlock</a>, they back the truck full of money to Joe Peci's and Marisa Tomei's houses and have them revise their characters and solve courtroom crimes somewhere else that they don't fit in?</p><p>I have more TV show pitches, y'all.<br><br>Lucky Hank is very similar to an idea I had about a Mad Men style drama set in the English Department of a huge state university. My version would have had a lot more political maneuvering and back-stabbing, and I dare say it would have been funnier. (Topic for another day: the embarrassingly shitty state of academic buildings at LSU.)</p><p>My most flushed out idea is for <em>Neighborhood Pool</em>, an Office-style mockumentary taking place at a neighborhood pool. My ideas are exaggerated stories based on real people and events from the Tara pool in Baton Rouge, and the fact that the pool is named after a slave-owning estate from <em>Gone With the Wind</em> is just the tip of the iceberg, comedy-wise.</p><a class="lightview alignright" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/tarapool1.jpg" data-lightview-caption="Tara pool pics from 2015" data-lightview-group="group1" style="width:350px;"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/tarapool1.jpg" alt="/img/tarapool1.jpg"><br><span class="caption">Tara pool pics from 2015</span></a><p>I'll piss off someone if I get into too many details, but there are sources that I can mine for comedy that are probably universal when it comes to the neighborhood pool experience:</p><ul><li>The board member committed to an overzealous enforcement of the rules.  Especially as it contrasts to our main-cast group of heavy-drinking parents.</li>
<li>Along with that, we have speak-to-the-camera sessions with the kids of the main characters, where they are dismissive of parental involvement and have their own little dramas going on.</li> 
<li>The tanning people, committed to their hobby in spite of the fact that their skin looks like overcooked sausage.</li>
<li>The people who have their own little territory and insist on their own music, so that everyone else hears a mismash of official club music and their tired classic rock playlist.</li>
<li>Lifeguards who continuously blow the pool closed in name of lightning, even though there is no threat of bad weather.</li>
<li>The angsty teen who brings his guitar to the pool to try to catch a lifeguard's attention</li>
<li>Adults who stand in the pool and pound Michelob Ultras all day long, yet never need to use the restroom.</li>
<li>The snack bar speaker, which announces whose orders are ready in unintelligible gibberish.  (Unintelligible Gibberish would be a good name for your cover band or your next boat.)</li>
<li>In my running plot for season 1, the pool parents find out that one of the dads is going to get divorced.  This leads to all of the tanning ladies -- both married and divorced -- to throw themselves at divorcing dad shamelessly.</li></ul><p>If anyone wants to make this when the writers and studios come to terms, I'll be happy to join the writers room. I haven't even been to the pool as a guest in several years, but the comedy tap is still providing.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/tarapool2.jpg" data-lightview-caption="tarapool2.jpg" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/tarapool2.jpg" alt="/img/tarapool2.jpg" width="450px"><br><span class="caption"></span></a>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://theskinnyonbenny.com/blog2/disgusting</guid><title>Disgusting</title><description>Your author discovers his disgust index and has some thoughts on the matter.</description><link>https://theskinnyonbenny.com/blog2/disgusting</link><pubDate>Thu, 4 May 2023 09:47:00 -0500</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I think that I've been a hater of internet polls from the dawn of internet polls, and certainly since the dawn of internet polls that encourage one to share their results to Facebook.</p><p>But that doesn't mean that I'm not secretly engaging with them, ever now and then.</p><p>I very much enjoyed the <a href="https://www.idrlabs.com/food-disgust/test.php" target="_blank">Food Disgust Test</a> that's making it's rounds this week. I assumed that I would score off-the-scale low, as I'll eat foods that most of you would consider garbage. And I was pretty much right:</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/disgusttest.jpg" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/disgusttest.jpg" alt="/img/disgusttest.jpg"  ><br><span class="caption"></span></a><p>But the author of <a href="https://defector.com/food-disgust-quiz-uncleanliness-is-next-to-godliness" target="_blank">the post that led me to this test</a> scored just 1/3 of what I did. A man "with a firm constitution" I think they would have said back in the old days.</p><p>The surprise on my graph is the Animal Flesh segment. I like the juice running out of my steak to be pink. A roasting pick looks disgusting (especially the face), but smells so delicious. The only flesh-like kitchen thing that nauseates me a little is cutting apart a whole chicken.</p><p>The feel of popping the thighs and the wings out of their joint so that the knife will slide cleanly between the ball and the socket has such a satisfying feel in the fingers, while also making me gag almost every time.</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9FHHmx6kDGc" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe><p><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/greenline.gif" class="greenline" alt="{{divider}}" /></p><p>I boiled crawfish a couple of times this Spring, and I wasn't ever thrilled with the results. I boiled for the third time this past weekend, and it turns out that not all of the packages of crab boil are created equally. Zatarain's Pro Boil made for a much better batch of crawfish. That, plus a 45-minute soak rather than the 20 minutes that the packaging suggests.</p><p>(I write this here so that I can remember the next time that I boil, two years from now.)</p><p>My most succesful boil was at the first annual crawfish cookoff in support of <a herf="https://www.redstickcares.org" target="_blank">Red Stick C.A.R.E.S.</a>. The 45-minute soak time was a combination of two things. First, I had the start time wrong in my head and geared up to have them ready an hour earlier than I was supposed to. And second, when I meant to pull them out, it was pouring rain, so I decided to let them soak some more.</p><p>The turnout was good. I can't imagine how good it would have been with the beautiful weather that we've had the rest of this week. They got BR Music Studio to line up some of their student bands, and those kids were pretty good. They also brought a whole lot of people that sat there and didn't buy tickets to eat crawfish.</p><p>I don't know what sort of space aliens can sit there smelling crawfish all day and not pony up $20 for an all-you-can-eat wrist band. Maybe they're all super high on the food disgust chart.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/carescrawfish1.jpg" data-lightview-caption="What a team!" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/carescrawfish1.jpg" alt="/img/carescrawfish1.jpg"  ><br><span class="caption">What a team!</span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/carescrawfish2.jpg" data-lightview-caption="During the rain delay" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/carescrawfish2.jpg" alt="/img/carescrawfish2.jpg"  ><br><span class="caption">During the rain delay</span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/carescrawfish3.jpg" data-lightview-caption="Good turnout" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/carescrawfish3.jpg" alt="/img/carescrawfish3.jpg"  ><br><span class="caption">Good turnout</span></a><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/carescrawfish4.jpg" data-lightview-caption="I wish I had gotten a better picture of V in his crawfish costume." data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/carescrawfish4.jpg" alt="/img/carescrawfish4.jpg"  ><br><span class="caption">I wish I had gotten a better picture of V in his crawfish costume.</span></a>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://theskinnyonbenny.com/blog2/europe-trip-part-1</guid><title>Europe Trip Part 1</title><description>I couldn't even find Slovenia on a map before I went there.

She's very close to being in a state as close to full repair as is possible, afer suffering an electrical surge just about a year ago. V and I motor-sailed her back to her home dock, and for the first time in a while, I really enjoyed being out on the water.</p><p>Meanwhile, we dream of new boats. On top of the disrepair, we'd really like another cabin and another head. We even went to the boat show in Annapolis back in October to see what features and designs the manufacturers are trotting out there now.</p><p>We saw some cool boats. A couple of French manufacturers are turning out 45 ft aluminum hull sailboats with centerboards that make them draw just a foot or two. Bali catamarans have a garage-door rear wall, so the whole thing can open up and put the main saloon in open-air (at the cost of having a tiny mainsail, and oh my god when that thing starts to leak. That's how I think about boat features now).</p><p>Mrs. theskinnyonbenny also found an <a href="https://pegasus-yachts.com/" target="_blank">intriguing boat</a> online that wasn't at the show. We wathced the video tour and talked to one of the owners about some questions that we had. That turned into an invite to spend a few days aboard one of their boats followed by a visit to their factory in Slovenia. That sounded fun, and we've been wanting to do a little touring in Eurpoe, so one day after school let out, we were on a plane.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/gal/176%2520-%2520Eurpoe%25202022%2520pt%25201%2520-%2520Slovenia%2520Croatia%2520Montenegro/resIMG_20220522_203305_IMG_7983_HEIC.jpg" data-lightview-caption="Pegasus 50 Hull #1" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/gal/176%2520-%2520Eurpoe%25202022%2520pt%25201%2520-%2520Slovenia%2520Croatia%2520Montenegro/resIMG_20220522_203305_IMG_7983_HEIC.jpg" alt="/img/gal/176%20-%20Eurpoe%202022%20pt%201%20-%20Slovenia%20Croatia%20Montenegro/resIMG_20220522_203305_IMG_7983_HEIC.jpg" width="650px"><br><span class="caption">Pegasus 50 Hull #1</span></a><p>(These, and many many more pictures are <a href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/gal/176" target="_blank">posted here</a>.</p><p>After three planes and a train from Venice to Triste (Italy), a car was supposed to meet us to bring us the rest of the way to Izola, Slovenia. It didn't show. We "wasted" some time in a sleepy Italian town, drinking a couple of beers and watching music videos before the bartender helped us find a cab that would take a credit card (as we had not gotten any Euro-cash yet. I'm pretty sure they all call it Euro-cash.)</p><p>We got let off at the marina in Izola, and still had to hike for what felt like three hours to circle around the boats and find the vessel where we were supposed to stay. They had it open, nice and clean, and a chilled local wine and some farmer's market fruit at the ready for us. Two of the owners of the company came by an hour or so later, and we had a good time swapping sailing stories and talking boats, despite how tired we were.</p><p>By then, it was getting on toward 9:00 PM on Sunday night, and finding an open restaurant proved to be a challenge. We wandered into a bar full of guys who didn't speak English and took a little while to figure out that there was no food there. But one of the guys was super nice, and he walked us out of the building and pointed us to the only nearby local restaurant. Dinner and drinks were great, and we got our first sign that prices in Slovenia are great.</p><p>The next two days, we put the boat through its paces. She sailed great -- having a correctly-shaped mainsail with full battens really helps I think (Velvet Elvis has a main that furls into the mast. It's convenient, but the poor sail shape has lead most of the boat-makers to abandon the design.) We had a lot of light wind, and she still moved. It's probably a better boat test -- in 17 kts, they're all going to move pretty well.</p><p>The Northern Adriatic is beautiful. It has deep blue water, and the ocean is rimmed by rolling hills. The Slovenia coast line is small enough that we were able to lay eyes on both Italy and Croatia in a couple of short day sails.</p><p>Exploring Izola was fun too. It's a small seaside down, wrapping around a huge marina. Streets are clean and full of flowers, and the town is full of young people and families. Although it was our Summer, their kids were still in school, so there was a definite rhythm to the days. We mostly sat at outdoor cafes, and we kept the boat stocked with wines, fruit and cheese.<br><br>At lunch one day, the waiter came by after a long wait, and V wasn't ready to order.<br><br>"What the heck?" asked his mother.</p><p>"I was staring at the wall," he replied.</p><p>"Huh?"</p><p>"It's a really nice wall."</p><p>I turned, and indeed, it was a nice wall.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/gal/176%2520-%2520Eurpoe%25202022%2520pt%25201%2520-%2520Slovenia%2520Croatia%2520Montenegro/resIMG_20220523_152653_IMG_8002_HEIC.jpg" data-lightview-caption="A nice wall" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/gal/176%2520-%2520Eurpoe%25202022%2520pt%25201%2520-%2520Slovenia%2520Croatia%2520Montenegro/resIMG_20220523_152653_IMG_8002_HEIC.jpg" alt="/img/gal/176%20-%20Eurpoe%202022%20pt%201%20-%20Slovenia%20Croatia%20Montenegro/resIMG_20220523_152653_IMG_8002_HEIC.jpg" width="650px"><br><span class="caption">A nice wall</span></a><p>After some sailing days, we took the bus to Ljubljana so that we could tour the factory where the boats get made. Like all bus routes everywhere, it took a roundabout way through rural towns. It was really pretty, but took an hour longer than it should have. We were shown great hospitality by our hosts, and examining the boats in various stages of construction was pretty cool. They brought us to a local place that served us all kinds of game (bear, goat duck) prepared deliciously, along with lots of local wines. I think we spent at least a couple of hours as course after course of meats came out.</p><p>Our planned bus out of town was full, so we ended up wandering around downtown Ljubljana. I'm so glad we did. It's an energetic, lively place with lots of beautiful buildings and a river running through it, which is always a nice touch.</p><p>After a night in Ljubljana, we decided to rent a car and move on to being tourists in Croatia.<br><br>The drive to Dubrovnik took most of the rest of the day. An interesting thing is that you drive a long way through Croatia, then have to pass through Bosnia and Herzegovina, and then back into Croatia again. These countries aren't part of the Schengen treaty, which is the one that lets you pass country to country without having to do the whole border crossing dance. So that day, we had to border cross into Croatia, border cross into Bosnia and Herzegovina, and then border cross back into Croatia. That significantly increases the travel time.</p><p>We got to the gates of Old Dubrovnik just before sunset. Old Dubrovnik is the walled city with narrow alleys between blocks of buildings. It's the part of town that's thousands of years old. I appreciate that the streets are marble stone. I'll go out on a limb and declare that t's impossible for your city to look like a shit hole when you have marble streets.</p><p>We spent a few days there, doing the tourist things -- wandering around and drinking wine, mostly. The tour of the city from the walls that loom up above is exhausting but worth the effort. It rewards you with views of the town and views out over the blue, blue sea.<br><br><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/gal/176%2520-%2520Eurpoe%25202022%2520pt%25201%2520-%2520Slovenia%2520Croatia%2520Montenegro/resIMG_20220527_172626_IMG_8102_JPG.jpg" data-lightview-caption="Paddling Dubrovnik" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/gal/176%2520-%2520Eurpoe%25202022%2520pt%25201%2520-%2520Slovenia%2520Croatia%2520Montenegro/resIMG_20220527_172626_IMG_8102_JPG.jpg" alt="/img/gal/176%20-%20Eurpoe%202022%20pt%201%20-%20Slovenia%20Croatia%20Montenegro/resIMG_20220527_172626_IMG_8102_JPG.jpg" width="650px"><br><span class="caption">Paddling Dubrovnik</span></a></p><p>Just over a couple of large hills from Dubrovnik is another border crossing -- this one into Montenegro. We booked a room over a weekend in another walled, ancient city -- this one Kotor.</p><p>We spent a weekend in Kotor, which to me, is like a rock-and-roll version of Dubrovnik. It's less crowded, less gleaming, and less touristy, but it was still a really cool place to visit. One thing that stands out is the massive number of stray cats. It's really the only place we visited with lots of stray animals. The cats added some personality to the place. We didn't see any that looked mangy or unhealthy.<br><br><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/gal/176%2520-%2520Eurpoe%25202022%2520pt%25201%2520-%2520Slovenia%2520Croatia%2520Montenegro/resIMG_20220528_174637_IMG_8186_HEIC.jpg" data-lightview-caption="The kids play in Kotor" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/gal/176%2520-%2520Eurpoe%25202022%2520pt%25201%2520-%2520Slovenia%2520Croatia%2520Montenegro/resIMG_20220528_174637_IMG_8186_HEIC.jpg" alt="/img/gal/176%20-%20Eurpoe%202022%20pt%201%20-%20Slovenia%20Croatia%20Montenegro/resIMG_20220528_174637_IMG_8186_HEIC.jpg" width="650px"><br><span class="caption">The kids play in Kotor</span></a></p><p>Take a look at <a href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/gal/176%2520-%2520Eurpoe%25202022%2520pt%25201%2520-%2520Slovenia%2520Croatia%2520Montenegro" target="_blank">all the pictures</a> I've posted for this leg of the trip</a>.

We got a lot of gear stored the weekend before, and then we did a final load of gear and provisions the day before we were set to leave. I was to get up at first light and head out.</p><p>The weather was a long way from ideal. It was blowing 25 knots, straight from the direction we would be trying to travel. In fact, it had pushed so much water from the Gulf up into Lake Pontchartrain that we had to wade out to the boat in water that fluctated between shin-deep and waist-deep while walking on the deck out to the boat.</p><p>On our departure date, I started the motor, got the lines off of the dock, and started to back off. As soon as the dock was out of reach, the motor died. I tried a few times to restart it, and then I screamed for help.</p><p>That monster wind was blowing us backwards, straight down the canal, and we were getting faster and faster. A crash into someone else's dock was imminent. Mrs. theskinnyonbenny called for the anchor (which was brilliant), and we got it down in time to stop our inevitable wreck.</p><p>I still couldn't get the motor to restart, so we hit #1 on boat speed-dial, Sea Tow. They sent a guy who was helpful, but he didn't think that with the wind gusts, he could move us around safely. We sent him on his way.</p><p>I spent some time troubleshooting and found that the deisel didn't smell like deisel. We had a ton of water in there. I won't get too technical, but there's a fuel/water separator in there. I spent an hour or so pumping fuel in there, skimming the water, and repeating until we were seeing actual deisel in there. After that, the motor started right up.</p><p>Afteer that, we decided to wait for a little bit better weather to shove off again. Two days later, we took off without incident.</p><p>On our first day out, the wind was better, but still pretty string, and still right on our bow. Once we got to Mississippi, we stayed inside the barrier islands, but we were still crashing into waves steadily under motor all day. The wind and waves settled down as it started to get dark, and that's when we noticed another problem.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/gal/171%2520-%2520Summer%25202021%2520Pt%25201%2520-%2520Getting%2520to%2520the%2520Exumas/resIMG_20210522_155053_IMG_1801.jpg" data-lightview-caption="On Mississippi Sound" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/gal/171%2520-%2520Summer%25202021%2520Pt%25201%2520-%2520Getting%2520to%2520the%2520Exumas/resIMG_20210522_155053_IMG_1801.jpg" alt="/img/gal/171%20-%20Summer%202021%20Pt%201%20-%20Getting%20to%20the%20Exumas/resIMG_20210522_155053_IMG_1801.jpg"  ><br><span class="caption">On Mississippi Sound</span></a><p>Our AIS (a dandy little piece of electronics that draws the position of other boats while we're out underway) had been giving us problems. Other boats were seeing us on their screens, but our screen didn't show any of them. I turned on the radar so that they would show up as purple blobs, at least, and it wasn't working either. We also had one light out. That's a whole lot of the things we have on board to make sure we don't bump into big giant ships in the middle of the night.</p><p>A nighttime passage across the Mobile Bay shipping channel is stressful enough under normal circumstances. From a distance, it's hard to tell a rig from a ship. At about 2:00 AM, I was thinking, "They shouldn't be allowed to put a red light on a rig like that. People will think it's the port side of a ship," and just then, the "rig" radioed me to to ask me to pass to his stern as he entered the Bay from the Gulf. Oops.</p><p>One night of that was enough, so we put in to Pensacola for repairs. I found a super-competent guy who was able to get a new AIS and a new radar shipped overnight, and got them installed. But as he worked, other electronic components started dying. He diagnosed a lightning strike, and told us that stuff would be failing one by one all Summer long. It was a dark time.</p><p>Memorial Day weekend was on us, so we went to a nice little anchorage near the mouth of Pensacola Bay. We had anchored there a time or two before, and usually shared it with a few other boats, some fishemen, and a dolphin or two. On Memorial Day weekend, it was boat tied to boat tied to boat from one shore to the other. Take a meth lab, the shittest modern country music artist, a beach resort, and roll it into one, then multiply that by a thousand. That's what was there.</p><p>We went up the sound towards Orange Beach, maybe a mile or so, and we had nice spots to kayak, swim, and dinghy for the weekend. A couple of dolphiins popped up near our dinghy, and Rosie decided, "fuck it, I'm chasing them" and dove into the water swimming for her water-bound playmates. We found a pretty good taco truck one night. It was a decent weekend.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/gal/171%2520-%2520Summer%25202021%2520Pt%25201%2520-%2520Getting%2520to%2520the%2520Exumas/resIMG_20210530_150250_IMG_6772.jpg" data-lightview-caption="Memorial Day Weekend - Dinner on the hook" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/gal/171%2520-%2520Summer%25202021%2520Pt%25201%2520-%2520Getting%2520to%2520the%2520Exumas/resIMG_20210530_150250_IMG_6772.jpg" alt="/img/gal/171%20-%20Summer%202021%20Pt%201%20-%20Getting%20to%20the%20Exumas/resIMG_20210530_150250_IMG_6772.jpg"  ><br><span class="caption">Memorial Day Weekend - Dinner on the hook</span></a><p>After that, the electronics guys were tearing apart our boat to replace things for a week. The cat and I stayed on board, while the rest of the family took a rental car and headed home. Liveaboard life by oneself on a boat where all of the panels are pulled off isn't fun. I had a bike and a dinghy to use for food runs, but not much close. I pretty well wiped out our summer's supply of hot dogs. It was a week of hot dogs, watching baseball on an ipad, and getting a lot of work done.<br><br>We finally got out of Pensacola June 11. Most of our stuff was working, but we were prepared for stuff to be failing. The plug for shore power air conditioning hadn't been replaced and was unusable, but we don't spend that much time in a marina anyway. The sail to Key West was more or less uneventful, and once there, we resupplied, visited some of our favorite hangouts, and tried to avoid the Covid-laden crowds.</p><p>Speaking of Covid, we had to get V a test to get in to the Bahamas. Mrs. theskinnyonbenny and I were vaccinated and K was under the age where they care. A very nice medical professional came out to our boat, stuck the swab up his nose, and disappeared. Results to follow by email. We rolled the dice and headed out. While still in sight of Key West, a monster squall blew through and tossed us all over the place for an hour or so. That was no fun.</p><p>The rest of the passage was fine. A couple of days and nights later, we were close enough to some Bahamian islands to unbox our hotspot and check the internet. The hotspot was an ancient piece of equipment whose screen showed something like 3TB of use up to that point. It was working okay, but if you put down your device to do something else for a bit, you had to power the hotspot off and back on for it to connect again. Not ideal.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/gal/171%2520-%2520Summer%25202021%2520Pt%25201%2520-%2520Getting%2520to%2520the%2520Exumas/resIMG_20210615_172358_IMG_6794.jpg" data-lightview-caption="Resupply run in Key West.

This is my favorite pic from the trip.</span></a><p>Somewhere in here, I also had an incident where a stream of salt water spray came right through a hatch in calm seas, landing right on my computer keyboard. The computer was toast.</p><p>On June 18, we pulled in to a marina in Nassau to clear in. We had V's covid clearance, and all of the paperwork was fine. I decided to fill the water tanks while the rest of the family moved booze and gear to a charter boat that our friends would be picking up later that same evening. The waater ran and ran and ran. It was taking forever. I blamed Bahamian water pressure, but still, it had only been a few days since we filled up in Key West. After forever, I pulled up some floor boards and saw that the water was running from our aft tank straight into the bilge. We were just filling fresh water and just as fast, the bilge pump was pumping it overboard. For the rest of the trip, a high water alarm would occasionally go off because of leaking water from that tank (later identified as a host to be replaced). The alarm shrieked an ungodly, inescapable scream, which is good for a high water alarm on a boat, but still....</p><p>After a full day sail to Highborne Cay, I tried moving the SIM card from the Bahamas hotspot to a different hotspot that we keep on board. Didn't work. I moved it back to the ancient hotspot and now it didn't work either. Without data, we were going to be pretty screwed. We went to bed frustrated, and pretty much assuming that our summer trip was entirely fucked.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/gal/171%2520-%2520Summer%25202021%2520Pt%25201%2520-%2520Getting%2520to%2520the%2520Exumas/resIMG_20210618_201634_IMG_2024.jpg" data-lightview-caption="Finally there." data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/gal/171%2520-%2520Summer%25202021%2520Pt%25201%2520-%2520Getting%2520to%2520the%2520Exumas/resIMG_20210618_201634_IMG_2024.jpg" alt="/img/gal/171%20-%20Summer%202021%20Pt%201%20-%20Getting%20to%20the%20Exumas/resIMG_20210618_201634_IMG_2024.jpg"  ><br><span class="caption">Finally there.</span></a><p>I woke early the next morning and made a last ditch effort with the SIM card. I had forgotten about my work hotspot that I keep in my computer bag. What do you know, it worked!

There were starfish, rays, and an island bar (where they were kind of rude and super expensive, but on this trip, we weren't going to get it all.

But I've been trying to write a little bit every week, because it's fun for me. I end up in this weird place where I tell myself, "I can't post about Y because I haven't even gotten around to writing about X, and it ends up where I don't post at all." That's as dumb as you're thinking it is, so I'm just going to start posting some things here and there. It won't chronicle life sequentially, but who cares?</p><p>This Summer, we sailed again to the Bahamas. While we were there, we enjoyed beautiful days, floating above crystal clear water, with cool breezes perfect for sailing and ventilation blowing night and day. But as good as the good stuff was, we'll also remember all of the fiascos. I'll probably circle back and try to detail the broken boat equipment, salt-ruined electronics, and travel snafus, but it will be more fun to document other people's misfortune first.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/IMG_20210626_164008_IMG_6862.jpg" data-lightview-caption="Hard not to miss the Bahamas when you go through the pictures." data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/IMG_20210626_164008_IMG_6862.jpg" alt="/img/IMG_20210626_164008_IMG_6862.jpg"  ><br><span class="caption">Hard not to miss the Bahamas when you go through the pictures.</span></a><p>Our friends Crystal and Robert were due to meet us in mid-July, right before we turned toward home. The morning they were supposed to fly out, I got a call while still in bed. Robert had been denied travel, because he ordered a "passport card" instead of a passport. It's a little cheaper, and as far as I can tell, it will get you on a cruise ship, but that's about it. I really don't know why they offer such a thing. It must cause problems all the time.</p><p>They were ready to cancel, but after spending all day looking for a new plan, we found a ferry from Fort Lauderdale that could get them in. (The cards are good for boats.) So they drove all night to Fort Lauderdale and were on the boat the next morning.</p><p>They arrived in Bimini, went to clear in to the country, and they were turned away. It turns out that Crystal wasn't in a place yet where she trusted the vaccine that has been in the works for 20 years, and her negative Covid test was about 5 minutes older than Bahamian customs would allow. Back on the ferry they went, for the return cruise to Florida.</p><p>But all was not lost. Robert knew someone who knew someone who worked for a US Congressman, and this samaritan got him an appointment at the Miami passport office. So they booked new plane tickets, scheduled a new Covid test, and started the next morning at their appointment.</p><p>It turns out that the appointment was just an appointment to stand in line. For five and a half hours. If I remember correctly, you can't even bring your phone into a federal building, so they stood in line for all of those hours with nothing to entertain them other than the back of the head for the person in front of them.</p><p>On day four of their week-long vacation, they finally boarded the plane that would get them to the Bahamas.</p><p>I'm tempted to describe the days we had as packed. We did force activities into every daylight moment and plenty of the nights as well. But at least a few of those days looked like this.</p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/IMG_20210717_134041_S0354044_JPG.jpg" data-lightview-caption="A lot of this." data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/IMG_20210717_134041_S0354044_JPG.jpg" alt="/img/IMG_20210717_134041_S0354044_JPG.jpg"  ><br><span class="caption">A lot of this.</span></a><p>We swam with the famous pigs, and I don't remember from our previous trips that they just shit constantly. These are some really photogenic pigs, but people go through great pains to get photos that don't include pig excrement of some variety or other. The fastest I moved the entire summer was a mad scramble, 10 yards away from a pig's behind, to jump into the dinghy and get away from a floating cloud of nastiness.</p><p>We had the grotto to ourselves, free of big boats full of tourists, which was amazing. We took side trips to Little Farmer's Cay and to Black Point, which was late in the day, and where I believe at least one of us was too drunk to remember. No shame there -- we came to play.</p><p>Vanya took up some time during the week getting himself invited to visit and eat with people on big giant yachts. One night, he had free lobster curry on board, while we ate $18 hambergers 50 yards away inside the yacht club.</p><p>They ended up being able to extend their trip by a couple of days, so all we really missed out on was rest. But there's plenty of time left for that when we're dead. Or when you have a 13 hour drive back home from Fort Lauderdale to end your vacation.</p><p>After we returned, Crystal's mom made a suggestion that I ran with as soon as I heard it. We now have this trophy to pass back and forth after each time we meet up, assuming someone does something dumb enough to deserve it. (Someone always does something dumb enough to deserve it.)<br><br><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/donkey1.png" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/donkey1.png" alt="/img/donkey1.png"  ><br><span class="caption"></span></a></p><a class="lightview centered" href="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/donkey2.png" data-lightview-caption="" data-lightview-group="group1"><img src="https://theskinnyonbenny.com/img/donkey2.png" alt="/img/donkey2.png"  ><br><span class="caption"></span></a>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
